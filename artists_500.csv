Coldplay,"Coldplay is a British alternative rock band, formed in London, United Kingdom in 1997. The band comprises vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland – who met each other in September 1996 at Ramsay Hall (halls of residence) at University College London - bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion.

Not only have Coldplay had 7 highly successful studio album releases (all of which debuted at #1 on the UK album chart) - with their latest 7th studio album released on December 4, 2015 (A Head Full of Dreams) - Coldplay have also achieved great success with their singles, such as Yellow, Speed of Sound, the Grammy-winning Clocks and the US and UK #1 single Viva La Vida.


Influences
Coldplay's early material was often compared to that of Jeff Buckley and Radiohead, while also drawing comparisons to U2 and Travis. Since the release of the band's debut album, Parachutes (2000), Coldplay has also drawn influence from other sources, including Echo and the Bunnymen and George Harrison on A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) and Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk for X&Y (2005).

Frontman Chris Martin credits 1980s Norwegian pop band a-ha for inspiring him to form his own band.

Coldplay never intended to become England's favorite rock & roll sons when their signature rock melodies ruled the charts throughout 2000. The quartet yearned to mess around a bit, plucking their own acoustics for fun while attending the University College of London. All had been playing instruments since their early teens and had been influenced by the likes of Bob Dylan, the Stone Roses, Neil Young, and My Bloody Valentine.

They never imagined taking reign of the UK's ever-changing rock scene. Each member had come from a solid household of middle-class parents who encouraged music. Chris Martin, the eldest of five siblings, began playing the piano as a young child. He started playing in bands around age 15 and sought solace in the words of Tom Waits. Jonny Buckland, on the other hand, was into the heavy guitar work of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix and was playing guitar by age 11. Scotland native Guy Berryman was into funk instead of indie rock, therefore leaving him to play bass. The multi-instrumentalist Champion had not planned to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay. He favored playing guitar, bass, and the tin whistle, but caught on to playing percussion when the band became official.

When they burst onto the scene, Coldplay were heart-wrenching like Travis, passionate like Jeff Buckley, and as fresh as Oasis. They played their first gig at a festival for unsigned bands in Manchester, and the Safety EP was issued shortly thereafter. The Brothers & Sisters EP was issued by Fierce Panda and released a year later. (Both releases saw only 500 pressings.) Their sweet melodies and swooning lyrics landed Coldplay a UK deal with Parlophone in April 1999, and the five-track limited edition Blue Room EP followed that autumn. With nods from the media, the dream pop foursome was hailed as the next Travis, thanks to their simplistic acoustics and charming personas. Two more EPs, Shiver and Yellow, arrived in Spring 2000.

Albums
The band has released 5 albums with the latest sixth album scheduled for release in May 2014: Parachutes (2000), A Rush Of Blood To The Head (2002), X&Y (2005), Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), Mylo Xyoto (2011) and in May 2014, Ghost Stories (2014).

Parachutes (2000)
Their full-length debut album, Parachutes, earned the band a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the UK. It saw a US release in November 2000, and a month later Yellow,  was chosen as the theme song for all promo spots for the American TV network ABC. The well-received hype surrounding Coldplay continued throughout 2001 as well; they were nominated for three Brit Awards and embarked on a sold-out ten-date tour of the US. Rumors of a split consumed most of the US tour. Martin frequently battled nasty colds and voice exhaustion, which led Coldplay to cancel a series of American dates and scrap a European tour. With all gossip aside, Coldplay resumed playing in Summer 2001 and earned additional success with second single Trouble.

A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002)
By the autumn, they had headed into the studio for a second album. Rumour had it that it might be Coldplay's last album, since the band members felt they might not capture such brilliance again. A Rush Of Blood To The Head was released in August 2002. The CD/DVD package Live 2003 was issued a year later. Capturing the band's show at the Horden Pavilion in Sydney, Australia, it highlighted Coldplay's monumental success worldwide with A Rush Of Blood To The Head. Martin specifically earned a higher notch on the celebrity scale by marrying actress Gwyneth Paltrow in December 2003. Paltrow gave birth to the couple's first daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin, the following April.

X&Y (2005)
Fatherhood did not stop Martin from working, as Coldplay began recording material for a third album within weeks. Previously recorded material with long-time producer Ken Nelson was scrapped early on, while producer Danton Supple (Morrissey, The Cure) joined Coldplay to complete the recording of X&Y. Speed Of Sound marked Coldplay's first single from their long-awaited third effort in Spring 2005; the album followed in June, topping the charts around the world, including America and Britain.

Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008)
Coldplay's fourth album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was released on June 12, 2008 in the United Kingdom, with the first single Violet Hill having been previously released as a free download through their official website for a week from April 29, 2008. Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was produced by Brian Eno, mixed by Markus Dravs, and drew influence from the time the group spent in South America. 
The album received lots of positive feedback for its originality in melodic acoustics and slightly less 'synth-dependent' riffs. It offered a great insight into how significantly the band's music had adapted and developed to themselves and the public.

Charity duet (single) for World AIDS Day (2008)
Barely a week before the album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was released, a duet with Kylie Minogue, which was intended to be used on the album, was scrapped with the comment that 'it’s just too sexy […] also we haven’t quite finished it'. The track, Lhuna was subsequently released as a charity single to promote World AIDS Day 2008 on December 1, 2008.

Mylo Xyloto (2011)
Coldplay's fifth album, Mylo Xyloto, was released on October 24, 2011, with the first two tracks from the album - Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall and Paradise - were released on June 3, 2011 and September 12, 2012 respectively. The album was no.1 in over 34 countries, and has sold over 8m copies worldwide.

Ghost Stories (2014)
The band's sixth album, Ghost Stories, was officially released on May 19, 2014. Prior to the release, Coldplay made the full album available to stream via iTunes, with an animation of the album artwork designed by Mila Fürstová, one week ahead of the official release date. The first track from the album, Midnight was released on February 25, 2014. The album was recorded at The Bakery and The Beehive studios in London, England. Ghost Stories entered the Billboard 200 as Number 1 and marked Coldplay's fourth straight number 1 studio album, selling 383,000 copies in the US in the week ending May 25, 2014 - of which 64% came from digital downloads according to Billboard.

A Head Full of Dreams (2015)
The band's 7th studio album, A Head Full of Dreams, was released December 4, 2015 on the Parlophone label. The 11-track album (with an additional hidden track called “X Marks The Spot”) was recorded in LA and London, and was produced by Stargate and Rik Simpson. A world tour is promised to accompany the album in 2016.

Super Bowl - February 2016
Coldplay headlined at the much coverted Super Bowl 50 half-time show on February 7, 2016. The band performed a remixed version of their hit single ""Yellow"", before playing ""Vida La Vida"", ""Paradise"" and their 2015 single ""Adventure Of A Lifetime"". Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson then took to the stage to perform their hit ""Uptown Funk"", before Beyoncé emerged on stage with her latest single ""Formation"".

2016 - First US tour since 2012
Coldplay announced its Head Full of Dreams tour on January 28, 2016 - the first in the USA since 2012. The first concert will be held at MetLife Stadium (New York) on July 16, 2016.

Commercial endorsements
Coldplay are one of very few current British music acts to achieve major success in North America. Despite their large worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, refusing its use for product endorsements. In the past, Coldplay had turned down multi-million dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who wanted to use the songs Yellow, Trouble, and Don't Panic respectively. According to Martin, ""We wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs' meanings like that.""  On the other hand, Yellow has been used to back TV trailers for ""The Simpsons"" and Viva La Vida featured on an iTunes TV advert.

Political and social activism
Since 2002, Coldplay have been active supporters of various social and political causes. They have been visible advocates of Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. The group has also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, and the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Radiohead,"Radiohead are an English alternative rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK which formed in 1985. The band is composed of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, beats), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboard, other instruments), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Greenwood (bass guitar) and Phil Selway (drums, percussion).

The early years (1992 – 1995)
Radiohead released their first single, ""Creep"" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993).  Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). The band's textured guitar parts and Yorke's falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans. 

International success (1996 - 2000)
Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s.

A change in style and leaving EMI (2000 – 2003)
Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a change in the band's musical style. Radiohead incorporated experimental electronic music, Krautrock, post-punk and jazz influences into their songs, dividing fans and critics, but they remained popular. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of guitar-driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by headlines, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. 

Independent releases and touring (2005 - 2013)
In 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows, originally as a digital download for which each customer could set their own price, later in stores, to critical and chart success.

In 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs - again independently - which was described as an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures.

In February 2012, Radiohead began The King of Limbs world tour - with concerts in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In early 2013, following the tour, Thom Yorke released a studio album entitled Amok with his band Atoms for Peace.

Ninth Studio Album - ""A Moon Shaped Pool""  (2016)
After much speculation, on May 8, 2016, Radiohead released their long awaited ninth album,""A Moon Shaped Pool"" on various streaming services. The band announced the release of their latest 11-track album on Twitter. The first track from the album was ""Burn the Witch"".

Glastonbury 2017
On October 20, 2016, Radiohead was announced as the headline act for the opening night at Glastonbury Music Festival in June 2017. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Sia,"Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (born 18 December 1975) or simply Sia, is an Australian pop, downtempo, and jazz singer and songwriter. In 2000, her single, ""Taken for Granted"" was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. Her 2008 album, Some People Have Real Problems peaked in the top 30 on the Billboard 200. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2009, she won the award for 'Best Music DVD' and received six nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 and won 'Best Independent Release' and 'Best Pop Release' for We Are Born and 'Best Video' for the song ""Clap Your Hands"".  

In 2000, the Adelaide born singer scored a bolt from the blue Top 10 hit with her debut single, Taken For Granted. Pairing her unique Australian drawl with the strident strings from Sergei Prokofiev's 'Romeo & Juliet', the track was championed by Trevor Nelson and had Sia performing live on Jo Whiley's Radio 1 show. Her debut album, Healing Is Difficult, arrived to similar cries of ´the next big R&B thing'. Then, to cap it all, she added her jazzy slurs to two tracks on Zero 7's Simple Things album and became the unmistakable voice of the year's coolest down-tempo soundtrack. All the pieces for a phenomenal career seemed to be in place.

And then nothing. 

""I went a bit mental after that,"" she explains, before letting out a laugh that would stop traffic. ""No seriously, I needed therapy and everything."" She recovers her composure only long enough to explain that going from hero to zero left her confused and frustrated and that it was a really enjoyable time, those moments of feeling like a 'Coolio'! But sadly they've passed now.

Brandishing both wicked humour and brutal honesty, it's sometimes hard to know exactly when Sia's joking. What is certain is that, with fragile beauty, a collaboration with Beck, and swathes of sensual soul-searching, 'Healing Is Difficult's long overdue follow-up, ‘Colour The Small One, rekindles thoughts of an all conquering phenomenon and will surely make her a 'coolio' once again.

From the lilting pianos and claustrophobic beats of Breathe Me, to Sunday's enchanting harmonium and breathless chant, it's a mesmerising album, undercut by the hope and despair of a little girl lost. Guilt, and how to deal with it, is the recurring theme with Sia's vulnerable voice as a beacon guiding through the pain and fear. ""I call it easy Listening,"" snorts Sia trying to keep a straight face. ""That's what I've been telling everyone."" A mix of horror and hilarity dawns on her face. ""Do you think it's depressing? It's not too depressing is it? It's meant to be nice, easy, music. Songy and lush."" 

Whatever it is, it certainly isn't the album anyone was expecting. The muffled rhythm track and sensual cinematic strings of Don't Bring Me Down are a stratosphere away from Taken For Granted's dogmatic march. Colour The Small One would never be mistaken for R&B. ""I hated that,"" she cringes at the thought of the jazzy beats and soulful grooves of her first album being tagged 'urban'. But that's not why this album's different. ""I just wanted to make an album that was more song driven, and I've changed as a person. After the first album I lost it, and this album reflects how I was feeling. The vocals are small and needy, because that's how I felt."" She looks momentarily troubled before adding, ""Plus, I'd tried to have a pop career and it didn't work, so I thought I'd try something else."" More strangulated giggling. ""If this doesn't work I'll fuck off back to Australia.""

Sia's vocal talents extend all the way back to her earliest memory. But unlike most singers, she isn't exactly the product of her childhood influences. Born in Adelaide, she was raised on the hippiest street in Australia. ""Everyone was a musician or worked for Circus Oz."" Her parents played in a rockabilly band called The Soda Jerks, and her dad, ""a real nut nut"", briefly played guitar in uncle Colin's band Men At Work- yes, they of 'I Come From A Land Down Under' fame- but ""they kicked him out for being too in yer face."" Early appearances singing Shangri-Las songs aside, Sia's musical leanings didn't get serious until she joined jazz-funk bar band  Crisp  at 17. ""We thought we were really cutting edge,"" she sniggers with a roll of her eyes, ""but we were trying way too hard."" 

In fact, Sia credits the biggest influence on both her and Colour The Small One as touring with Zero 7. ""That's when I actually started listening to music,"" she says with a grimace of embarrassment. ""All the other music I'd listened to in my life had been incidental; in clubs, cars, lifts. I only owned 2 CDs: The Jackson 5 anthology and Jeff Buckley's Grace. While we were on tour, the Zero 7 guys were always talking about artists I'd never heard of, so I bought a Discman and started listening to their James Taylor, Nick Drake, Harry Neilson, Randy Newman and Django Bates CDs. And it all just really blew me away.""

Colour The Small One's lyrical roots, however, run much deeper. After three years fronting Crisp, Sia packed her bags and headed off with an open ended ticket on a round the World trip. After enjoying colourful times in some unusual places, she agreed to meet up in London with the man she describes as her 'first true love'. A week before she arrived, he was run down and killed by a black cab on Kensington High Street.

""Nearly everything on the first album was about that,"" she says, her chirpy facade slipping. ""I was pretty fucked up after Dan died. I couldn't really feel anything. I could intellectualise a lot of stuff; that I had a purpose, that I was loved, but I couldn't actually feel anything. The last album was very deflective. This one's very exposing. I think that's the difference between the two albums, the first was intellectualising, this one is feeling."" Catching herself being uncharacteristically serious, she quickly deflects with a half chuckle of, ""and I'd quit drinking. That was probably what it was.""

Bully, the track she wrote with Beck has similarly serious roots. ""There was this kid at school who I used to be really cruel to, and I've felt bad about it ever since. It got to the point where I was having nightmares about it. So I wanted to write a sorry song."" Thankfully, the collaboration itself had happier origins. ""The last date of the Zero 7 tour was a festival at the Universal Amphitheatre in LA and Beck was on the same bill. Next thing he's ringing Zero 7's management asking if I'd like to duet with him."" Understandably she said yes, and found herself on stage singing 'You're The One That I Want' from Grease. ""I suggested it as a joke; but we changed the major to a minor, made it really slow and turned it into a bit of a country stalker anthem."" 

The Beck and Zero 7 connections- Sia's already recorded two more tracks to their next album - give the biggest clues to ‘Untitled’ and the giggling Australian's current intentions. ""I don't want to be a superstar, doing all that wibbly-wobbly stuff. It's too emotionally stressful; photo shoots always make me want to have plastic surgery. I just wanted to write an album that was me: a small, weird, needy freak. It's a slow burner, but it's honest.""

Colour The Small One was released in the UK on 12th January 2004. 

And then, she came back with her new album Some People Have Real Problems, released on 8 January 2008. A little bit different from her previous albums, the new album received good reviews, although some critics and fans didn't really like the new  ""a little bit more pop"" direction. 

The first single  Day Too Soon  was released on 12 November 2007 in the UK and was followed by The Girl You Lost to Cocaine  on the 21st April 2008 and later followed by Soon We'll Be Found which was released on 13 October 2008. Soon We'll Be Found got the best reviews because of its music video. In the music video, Sia sings while signing the lyrics in American Sign Language.

Sia worked with  Christina Aguilera  on her new album Bionic and the new collaboration has produced four tracks including the soulful ballad ""You Lost Me"". The album was released June 8, 2010. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sia"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Weeknd,"The Weeknd, the stage name for Abel Tesfaye, is a Canadian singer-songwriter and producer.
The Scarborough, Toronto-born singer, songwriter, and producer doesn't say much outside of his lyrics or personal messages through his social networking sites. Ever since appearing on the scene in late 2010, he's been shrouded in mystery, cultivating a mystique that baffles our gossip-obsessed pop culture. With that said, the 25-year-old alternative R&B phenomenon is an enigma in more ways than one.

For him, it's not about becoming famous. It's not about becoming rich. It's not about pleasing anyone. It's about being honest, staying true to his art, and diving headfirst into the deep end. History's most impactful artists from Van Gogh and Charles Bukowski to Miles Davis and John Lennon faced both the abyss and the heavens. They knew about sex, drugs, pain, joy, and love, and they weren't afraid to talk about them openly.

On his three-disc debut for XO/Republic Records, Trilogy, The Weeknd is an open book, revealing
everything and nothing at the same time. There are moments of ecstatic electronic bliss like the irresistible ""High for This"", and then there's the propulsive poetic paranoia of ""House of Balloons"", which twists a sample Siouxsie and the Banshees' Happy House into a frenetic danceable coup. With an inimitable and divine voice, he sings of hazy nights that turned into hazier mornings and tumultuous trysts that spiraled into eternal longing. However, you can take whatever you want from it. After all, it is art.

His trip officially began with the release of the nine-song free album House of Balloons in March 2011. It was the first in a series of three-including Thursday and Echoes of Silence-and it immediately set the blog-o-sphere ablaze. Soon after the initial instalment impacted the net, Drake quoted lyrics from the effort on Twitter and linked to the music, becoming the first of many A-list artists to champion it. The two quickly forged a tight friendship and fertile artistic partnership that extended to Drake's team.

As they grew closer, the superstar MC even enlisted his talents for several tracks on the chart-topping, platinum-selling and Grammy Award winning album Take Care. Most notably, The Weeknd co-wrote, co-produced, and performed on ""Crew Love"", a bona fide hit single from the record. Further collaborating, Drake dropped a transfixing verse on ""The Zone"" from Thursday.

The artist hit the road for his first sold out headline tour that summer, and the world began to embrace him with open arms from underground bloggers to taste-making music supervisors. ""High for This"" even served as the soundtrack to the trailer for the final season of HBO's long-running series, Entourage, a symbol of his infiltration into the zeitgeist.

Meanwhile, critics and gatekeepers also fell under his spell. Complex dubbed House of Balloons the ""best album of 2011"", and Pitchfork honored it as ""Best New Music"". It conquered year-end lists, including Stereogum, The A.V. Club, The Guardian (UK), and Spin. MTV, BET, Rolling Stone, XXL, and others exalted it with equally high praise, while The Source called him the ""Songbird of his generation"".

In the midst of everything, other marquee artists began to personally seek out his unique talent, and that was the highest compliment. He created the first formal remix for FLORENCE + THE MACHINE's ""Shake It Out"", and he put his stamp on LADY GAGA's ""Marry the Night"", yielding a seductive and sensual take on the single for Born This Way: The Remixes. The Weeknd also personally cooked up ""Remember You"" the second single for WIZ KHALIFA's anxiously awaited sophomore effort, O.N.I.F.C.

In the summer of 2012, a groundbreaking strategic alliance between XO, creative collective visionary behind The Weeknd and Republic Records was established. Under this banner, Trilogy compiled House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence in one expansive collection, properly mixed, mastered, and
finished for the very first time. The 27 original tracks remain, but there's also a myriad of new material as well to please both the initiated and uninitiated alike. The doorway officially opens into his world with this effort.

The first single ""Wicked Games"" bleeds brilliantly with a stark and vivid admission that's utterly enthralling. Keyboards resound through airy production as the vocals exude a dark sensuality. The singer admits, ""I love to watch you dance, take you down another level and get you dancing with the devil"", before the unforgettable, unbridled hook, ""Let me motherfucking love you"".

You're going to motherfucking love him. Live audiences continue to as well. In addition to surprise appearances on DRAKE's Club Paradise tour and a stint supporting FLORENCE + THE MACHINE, he dazzled crowds at the biggest festivals in the world including Coachella, Primavera Sound Festival, and the Wireless Festival in London and on a seemingly endless run of sold out headline gigs. The next chapter has begun though.

Coming together, Republic Records and the Canadian XO are paving the way for a revolution. Already, XO has progressed from an intimate Toronto operation into an international player. Everything stems from the music though, and it always will. THE WEEKND addressed fans in an open letter online, ""You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you."" He released his second album, ""Kiss Land"", on September 10, 2013.

(2) Allegedly ""shrouded in mystery"" despite a social media presence (with accompanying photos) on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Soundcloud, and YouTube, as well as major support from fellow Torontonian Drake, alternative R&B act the Weeknd -- a solo outlet for vocalist Abel Tesfaye -- surfaced in March 2011 with House of Balloons. A nine-track, 50-minute mixtape made available for free download on the Weeknd website, House of Balloons was based in morose ballads filled with drug references and sexual longing. Sonically, there were clear traces of radio-friendly contemporary R&B à la Trey Songz, Jeremih, the-Dream, and Drake, while also appealing to listeners who favored left-of-center, production-over-songcraft exponents like Spacek and Sa-Ra. The mixtape, made by Tesfaye in collaboration with producers Doc McKinney and Illangelo, among others, garnered widespread coverage -- most of which was gushingly positive -- within days of its March 21 release. A second mixtape, Thursday (August 19), preceded several appearances on Drake's album Take Care. Echoes of Silence (December 21), the third Weeknd mixtape, followed just before the end of the year. The following June, ""Crew Love,"" off Take Care, reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. A few months later, he was featured on another charting single, Wiz Khalifa's ""Remember You."" 

 After Tesfaye signed with Universal Republic, the three Weeknd mixtapes were remastered and bundled with three new songs for Trilogy, issued in November 2012. The set debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. The following April, Tesfaye won Juno Awards in the categories of Breakthrough Artist of the Year and R&B/Soul Recording of the Year. Trilogy was certified platinum by the RIAA the next month. Kiss Land, much darker in tone than its title implied, followed in September 2013 and debuted at number two. Out of its several singles, only ""Live For,"" featuring Drake, touched the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. Tesfaye had much more success with a series of non-album singles that followed. ""Often,"" released in 2014, was a Top Ten R&B/Hip-Hop hit. He was featured on Ariana Grande's ""Love Me Harder,"" which reached the Top Ten of the Hot 100 and went platinum in the U.S. ""Earned It,"" featured in Fifty Shades of Grey, repeated the same feats. In 2015, Tesfaye issued ""The Hills,"" a booming ballad, and ""Can't Feel My Face,"" a disco-funk throwback, as the first two singles from Chapter III. The former cracked the Hot 100 Top 20, while the latter reached the chart's Top 10. ~ Andy Kellman <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Drake,"Aubrey “Drake” Graham (born October 24, 1986 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Grammy award nominated Canadian actor, rapper and singer signed to Young Money/Universal Motown. Drake shot to global fame upon the release of his critically acclaimed 2009 mixtape So Far Gone and Best I Ever Had, a single from the mixtape which peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Drake's music career began in 2006 with the release of his debut mixtape room for improvement. The tape featured collaborations with Trey Songz, Lupe Fiasco and Nikelus F and marked the beginning of a long-time partnership with Canadian producer boi-1da. The mixtape sold 6,000 physical copies in the year of its release.

comeback season, Drake's second official mixtape, was released in 2007 and featured the single replacement girl. The track featured vocals from Trey Songz and received heavy rotation on MTV and BET television networks. robin thicke, clipse and rich boy featured on the mixtape, however it was Man of the Year - a track recorded with future mentor lil wayne - which signified the start of a close affiliation between Drake and Lil' Wayne's recording label Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his highly anticipated third mixtape so far gone to critical acclaim and commercial success. Its lead single, Best I Ever Had, peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA. The success of the track lead to a highly publicised bidding war between several record labels to sign Drake. The rapper eventually signed a deal with Young Money Entertainment in the summer of 2009 and released an official EP version of the mixtape soon after; eventually receiving Gold status for shipments of 500,000 units.

This astronomical rise to success continued into 2010 with the release of his major label debut album thank me later. After several setbacks from its original October 2009 release date, the album was released on June 15th 2010 preceded by lead single over, which peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at #1 on the Hot Rap Songs chart. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Album Chart and has since been certified Platinum by the RIAA for sales of approximately 1,100,000 copies in the US to date. It produced three further singles which attained chart success; Find Your Love, Miss Me (feat. Lil' Wayne) and fancy (feat. T.I. & Swizz Beatz).

Drake released his second album 'Take Care' in November 2011 and it critically and commercially was very successful.The album spawned eight singles including the immensely popular The Motto which introduced the term 'YOLO' to the mainstream. With features from Lil Wayne, Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj and more the album went 2x platinum in the United States and in Canada, but only managing gold in the United Kingdom.

In November 2013 Drake released the highly anticipated 'Nothing Was The Same'  which was also very critically and commercially succesful and has since spawned seven singles. Jay Z is the only other rapper to appear on the standard version of the album. Drake said about the album ""Take Care was about connecting with my city and connecting with my past and sort of still feeling guilty that I'm not in love with one of these girls that cared about me from back in the day. Now, I'm 26, I'm with my friends, I'm making jobs for people, I'm making memories for people that will last a lifetime. I don't need to be in love right now. I don't need these things that I maybe once thought that I needed to feel normal and feel righteous about myself. I think for the first time in an album I'm content—not satisfied—but proud of where I'm at as a person.""

Drake announced in July 2014 that his next album would be titled 'Views from the 6', though no release date has been given. However, in February 2015, with no prior announcement, Drake released 'If You're Reading This It's Too Late' on iTunes. This marked Drake's fourth retail release with his record label Cash Money Records. Despite stating the release as a mix-tape it was made available for purchase on iTunes. As of August 2015, 'If You're Reading This It's Too Late' has sold over 1 million copies. Drake is the first artist to pass the Platinum album status in 2015.

Drake released his fourth album, Views, in 2016, breaking numerous chart records in the process. Views sat atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a solo male to do so in over 10 years. It also saw Drake leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 simultaneously for eight weeks, breaking the previous record of seven held by both Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. It also achieved triple platinum status in the U.S., and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. One of the tracks,  One Dance, became Drake's first #1 single on the Hot 100, spending ten weeks on top of the chart. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Drake"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rihanna,"Robyn Rihanna Fenty (born February 20, 1988), known by her stage name, Rihanna, is a Bajan singer.  Her song Umbrella was one of the highest-selling songs of 2007 and her 3rd album Good Girl Gone Bad was critically acclaimed, helping propel her to superstar status. She has attained thirteen Billboard Hot 100 number ones thus far and is the second Bajan artist to win a Grammy Award. She is also a cultural ambassador for Barbados.

Rihanna was born in Saint Michael, Barbados to Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor, and Monica Fenty, an accountant.  Her mother, a native of Guyana, is Afro-Guyanese and her father is Bajan and Irish. She is the oldest of three siblings; two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty.  She began singing at around the age of seven.  Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's addiction to crack cocaine and parent's rocky marriage, which ended when she was fourteen years old.  Rihanna attended Charles F. Broome Memorial School, a primary school in Barbados, and then the Combermere School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates at the age of fifteen.  In 2004 she won the Miss Combermere Beauty Pageant.  She was an army cadet in a sub-military programme that trained with the military of Barbados and Shontelle was her drill sergeant.

At the age of 15, she formed a girl group with two of her classmates.  In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing in Barbados with his wife.  The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that ""the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.""   While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang Destiny's Child's cover of ""Emotion"".  Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with Rogers and his wife.  Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad ""The Last Time,"" a cover of Whitney Houston’s hit ""For the Love of You"" and what would become her first hit, ""Pon de Replay"" to send to various recording companies.  It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna's demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her to audition for the label's then-president, Jay-Z, who quickly signed her.

Rihanna broke into the recording industry in 2005 with the release of her debut album Music of the Sun, which features the number 2 hit single ""Pon de Replay"".  Less than a year later, Rihanna released A Girl Like Me and earned her first number-one single, ""SOS, which sampled the popular 80s track ""Tainted Love"".  ""Unfaithful"" was also released and was fairly successful.

Rihanna released her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, in June 2007. Prior to the release of the album, she spent the week of the Grammys writing songs for the album with Ne-Yo.  She adopted a more sexual image while recording the album, eventually dying her hair black and cutting it short. Rihanna worked with Timbaland and Christopher ""Tricky"" Stewart, as well as previous musical collaborators such as Stargate, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers to re-imagine her album compositions with uptempo dance tracks. Rihanna commented, ""I want to keep people dancing but still be soulful at the same time.  You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs].""

The album topped the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Russia and Ireland, and peaked at number two in the United States and Australia.  Unlike previous work, the album featured a more dance-pop sound instead of the dancehall, reggae and ballad styles. The album received positive reviews by critics, becoming her most critically acclaimed album at that time compared to her previous efforts.

It yielded eight hit singles - ""Umbrella""  ""Shut Up and Drive"", ""Don't Stop The Music"" ""Hate That I Love You"" ""Rehab"" ""Disturbia"" ""Take A Bow"" ""If I Never See Your Face Again"" - all singles reaching the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 — including the worldwide number-one hit ""Umbrella,"" featuring Jay-Z.  

In addition to reaching number one in various countries, ""Umbrella"" was the number one single in the United Kingdom for ten consecutive weeks, making it the longest-running number-one single since Wet Wet Wet's single ""Love Is All Around"" spent fifteen weeks at the top in 1994.  The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007 published by Rolling Stone magazine.  In 2008, ""Umbrella"" earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It managed to stay at number one in the United Kingdom for 10 weeks, the longest time spent by a female and in the 21st century, on this chart.

""Umbrella"" has also been recognised in various forms of accolades by the music press. The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007, published by the music magazine Rolling Stone. Time magazine also listed the song number three on their Top 10 Songs of 2007. The song is listed number one on Entertainment Weekly magazine's list of the 10 Best Singles of 2007, while topping the magazine's poll for the best single of 2007. Blender magazine awarded the song Song of the Year in their Readers' Poll 2007. The music press has considered ""Umbrella"" as 2007's Song of the Summer,  while The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh regarded it as ""arguably 2007's signature slow jam"".

In August 2009, Rihanna collaborated with Jay-Z and Kanye West on ""Run This Town."" The song peaked at number two on Billboard Hot 100 and also reached the top ten in five other countries. She appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia for the September 2009 Issue.  The shoot was influenced by Rihanna's hair, which she had cut for the shoot into a mohawk-like style. The style of the shoot was Extreme Couture and very dark, and in one shot she appeared semi-nude.  Rihanna performed ""Run This Town"" along with Jay-Z and West for the ""Answer the Call"" concert at Madison Square Garden in September 2009, making it her first musical performance since the altercation with Brown. The trio also performed ""Run This Town,"" on the premiere of The Jay Leno Show on September 14, 2009.

In November of 2009, ""Rated R"" was released in the wake of a physical altercation with romantic interest Chris Brown, who pled guilty to felony assault. The album's lead single, ""Russian Roulette"" -- written with Ne-Yo - was one of the year's most controversial singles. The album also includes collaborations with Tricky, The-Dream, Stargate, and SRP.

One year later, Rihanna released her fifth studio album called ""Loud'. It's lead single, ""Only Girl (In the World)"", reached number one in more than ten countries. The song also won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.

""Talk That Talk"" was released one year after ""Loud"". With the song ""We Found Love"", Rihanna became the fastest solo artist in the chart's history to achieve twenty Hot 100 top-ten singles, breaking the previous record set by Madonna. The song later became her eleventh number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. ""You Da One"" became the second single from the album but was not as successful as ""We Found Love"". The third single from the album, ""Talk That Talk"" featuring Jay-Z, was announced on Rihanna's Twitter. The fourth single, ""Where Have You Been"", peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.


On February 20, 2012, Rihanna and Chris Brown released 2 remixes, one featuring the ""Talk That Talk"" album track ""Birthday Cake"" and the other featuring Chris Brown's ""Turn Up The Music""

In April 2012, the singer appeared in the movie ""Battleship"", which is based on the game of the same name.

Rihanna's seventh album, Unapologetic was released on November 19, 2012; it was preceded by the lead single Diamonds, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the chart and tying her with Madonna and The Supremes for the fourth-most number ones in the chart's history.

Rihanna has been working on her, currently untitled, eighth studio album since 2014. The first single from her upcoming album FourFiveSeconds was released on January 24, 2015. The second single Bitch Better Have My Money debuted on Tidal on April 5, 2015.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers' original founder and guitarist, Slovak, was replaced in 1984 by Jack Sherman, while Slovak and Irons recorded music with their band at the time, ""What Is This?"" Upon Slovak's return, Sherman was fired from the band. 

Slovak did not actually appear on the self-titled debut album, despite performing and writing the content with the band prior to recording. He was replaced by Jack Sherman for the recording of the album, but returned to the band for second album, Freaky Styley. The third album, Uplift Mofo Party Plan, is in fact the only album to include all four founding members. After this, Slovak overdosed on heroin and was replaced on future albums (Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magik  - on which Frusciante provides guitars, One Hot Minute - Navarro,  Californication and By the Way - Frusciante) Frusciante is also on 2006's Stadium Arcadium.

Following Slovak's death of a heroin overdose, a young John Frusciante took over as guitarist in 1988. Frusciante, however, quit the band in 1992 due in part to his sadness at the band becoming so successful in such a short time; complex personal issues, involving an addiction to heroin, were also a factor. He was then replaced by Arik Marshall. Approximately a year later, Marshall left the band, to be replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.

After the release of 1995's One Hot Minute, Navarro's escalating drug habits became a subject of conflict. In 1998, Navarro was fired from the band, to be taken over by none other than former guitarist, Frusciante, who remained in the band until 2008, when he quietly took his leave on good terms with the other members.

Frusciante has also been making solo albums for a number of years. His new album with the band Ataxia came out May 2007, and is titled Automatic Writing II.

In 2003 Flea played bass on The Mars Volta's album Deloused In The Comatorium. Frusciante added guitar to tracks on Deloused and 2005's Frances The Mute. He also played rhythm guitar on The Mars Volta's Amputechture. Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez, guitarist for The Mars Volta, appeared on Stadium Arcadium, playing the solo on ""Especially In Michigan"".

In 2011, the band released  I'm With You, their tenth studio album, and their first with guitarist Josh Klinghoffer.

A new era in the band's history took place due Frusciante's departure in 2009. He was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who had already played shows as a second guitarist with the band during their 2007 tour dates. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Since signing to Fueled By Ramen in 2012, the duo have released their major label debut Vessel in January of 2013, and its explosively popular follow-up Blurryface in May of 2015. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Twenty+One+Pilots"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Major Lazer,"Years after the zombie apocalypse ravaged the galaxy, Major Lazer went into isolation after bringing peace and order to Earth. With the help of a mysterious shadow government called Cinco he was cryogenically frozen as a safeguard for the future’s wellbeing. Despite a great many years of pursuing peace on the planet, a new threat began to loom on the horizon and the commando was brought out of sleep by the Committee of Five. This intergalactic group faced an opponent that only Major Lazer could defend against: his former superior and commander General Rubbish. Rubbish had come out of deep space hiding with a new weapon...Terror Lazor and was set out to enslave and capture all of Earth's allies to seize inter-galactic planetary control and then destroy Earth. With dwindling resources to defend Earth and its allies, the Committee of Five brought Major Lazer out of cryogenic slumber. He was assigned a partner, the female assassin known only as Knife Fight. Together they set out to FREE THE UNIVERSE, beginning on the fortuitous date of April 15th, 2013.

Since 2011, the group consists of Diplo, Jillionaire and Walshy Fire

After releasing their landmark LP Guns Don't Kill People...Lazers Do in 2009, the heroic production duo of Diplo and Switch found themselves boldly marching forwards toward the end of the aughts, conquering major milestones. From 2009 to 2011, the twosome toured extensively across the United States and the world, selling out shows and performing at some of music’s major festivals, including Coachella, Pitchfork, Sasquatch, Outside Lands, and Falls Music & Arts Festival.

In 2010, Major Lazer released Lazerproof, a free download mixtape with pop sensation La Roux, and Lazers Never Die, an EP featuring two new tracks and three remixes, including one by Thom Yorke. One of the foremost breakthroughs for Major Lazer during this time was the production collaboration with Beyoncé on her single “Run the World (Girls)”, which sampled their track “Pon de Floor."" BeyoncÉ directly sought out Switch and Diplo, recognizing the fact that they were creating authentically innovative music and further cementing their status as a production team worthy of worldwide mainstream attention. As 2011 turned to 2012, Switch determined it best to pursue his own path, leaving Diplo in full control of Major Lazer.

As the sole executive producer of Major Lazer, Diplo continued to spearhead the current dancehall revival movement with the 2013 release Free The Universe. That album included collaborations with Bruno Mars, Tyga, Flux Pavilion, Wynter Gordon, Shaggy, Wyclef Jean, Ezra Koening from Vampire Weekend, Dev and more. Spin called the LP’s first single ""Get Free"" featuring Amber Coffman of Dirty Projectors, ""a meeting point between Jamaica, West Africa, and Brooklyn."" 

Diplo (AKA Wesley Pentz) has risen through the ranks and has asserted himself as one of the most pioneering producers of the time. Through unending curiosity and exploration of the vast multitudes of the world’s musical heritages, Diplo has managed to seamlessly connect the global underground to the audio mainstream. He is the Grammy-nominated founder, owner and head honcho of Mad Decent records, which has not only garnered widespread critical and audience accolades since its inception, but has also deservedly earned a hefty reputation as a vanguard of groundbreaking releases. As Major Lazer, he retreated to Jamaica in 2012 to team up with producers Ariel Rechtshaid and Dre Skull on Snoop Lion's (Snoop Dogg) 2013 album  ""Reincarnated"". Major Lazer was also featured on the title track from No Doubt's 2012 comeback album with famed dancehall artist Busy Signal and released an official remix for Hot Chip’s ""Look At Where We Are"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Major+Lazer"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Beatles,"The Beatles were an iconic rock group from Liverpool, England. They are frequently cited as the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in modern history, with innovative music, a cultural impact that helped define the 1960s and an enormous influence on music that is still felt today. Currently, The Beatles are one of the two musical acts to sell more than 1 billion records, with only Elvis Presley having been able to achieve the same feat.
     
After conquering Europe, with successful tours to Germany and Sweden, the Beatles led the mid-1960s musical 'British Invasion' into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored a great variety of musical styles including Psychedelic Rock, Experimental, Ballads, Western and Indian Classical among others. Their clothes, hairstyles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. 
     
Early on, the band consisted of George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best. The band got its first major break playing in Hamburg, Germany, at some rather seedy nightclubs, beginning in 1960. While in Germany, they also met Klaus Voormann, who would later design the cover of the group's 1966 album Revolver. Sutcliffe remained in Germany when the others returned to England and became engaged to fellow artist Astrid Kirchherr, only to die a few years later of a brain hemorrhage. 

In 1961, Brian Epstein heard their sound and was thrilled enough to sign on as their manager, even though he had no previous experience in that field. After Decca Records rejected the band with the famous comment ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein"", his efforts eventually led, in 1962, to an audition with EMI producer George Martin, who signed them to EMI's Parlaphone label. 

Later, due in part to Martin's refusal to use him on recordings, Pete Best was replaced by Ringo Starr, the drummer from another big Liverpool band known as Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Ringo was supposed to play on their first single, ""Love Me Do"", but George Martin had Andy White, a session drummer, play instead (Ringo can be heard on the album version of the song).
     
In 1963, The Beatles initiated a craze known as ""Beatlemania"" in the UK with the song ""Please Please Me"". Their first album of the same title was recorded in just one day. This fame spread internationally and, in February of 1964, they arrived in the United States. Their first appearance in the States was on the Ed Sullivan Show, following ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" going #1 in the States. With this success, the Beatles released two feature length films within the space of two years: A Hard Day's Night and Help!. The songs from both films were penned by Lennon and McCartney, and albums followed their release. In Help!, the Beatles were given greater creative freedom, deciding for example to head to the exotic location of the Bahamas simply to shoot one scene.  
     
The Beatles were comprised of four members in the long run: John Lennon (vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Paul McCartney (vocals, bass guitar, piano, guitar), George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals), and Ringo Starr (percussion, vocals). Lennon and McCartney were the main songwriters and singers, although songs penned by George started showing up more frequently on later albums. Ringo traditionally sang one song on each record. George Martin produced most of the Beatles' records, and was a highly influential part of the band's sound on most of their records. He also played the renowned solo on ""In My Life"" (Rubber Soul). 
     
For years, The Beatles showed an amazing talent for writing hit after hit. In 1966, they ceased performing in concert (apparently they grew weary of the constant screaming from the fans, which always got so loud they could never hear themselves play; another contributing factor was the extraordinary lengths they had to go to for security reasons before and after each performance) and began exploring new sounds in the studio. This is especially apparent in albums such as Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Beatles, sometimes known as ""The White Album"". The White Album  is considered the band's most experimental. The novel sounds featured are due to the growing presence of Yoko Ono (Lennon's wife), as demonstrated by the song ""Revolution 9"", and the band's increasing use of drugs. The song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" (from Sgt. Pepper's) was rumored to be an ode to LSD, although the band vehemently denied any link; they instead insisted that it described a drawing made by John Lennon's son, Julian Lennon. After the death of Brian Epstein, the Beatles began to unravel at the seams. The Beatles officially split at the dawn of 1970; Lennon had unofficially quit the previous year and the band had maintained the front of being together to protect their business interests. McCartney, who was the first to announce that he had officially ""quit"" the band and that they no longer existed, was often blamed for the band's ending although by the end he was the only one willing to carry on and was, by stating the group no longer existed, admitting to the facts.  
     
The Beatles never reunited properly in the 1970s as they never fully recovered from the acrimony associated with their breakup. They did, however, make two new records in 1994, despite Lennon's 1980 death, for the Anthology project. ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love"" were based on demo tapes made by Lennon and sent to McCartney by his widow Yoko Ono. They charted in the UK at #2 and #4 respectively.
  
The Beatles also created some of the first music videos, having filmed promotional films in 1965 for broadcasters to show across the US and Europe rather than have to appear live. Their 1967 film promos for ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Penny Lane"" have even more similarity to modern music videos, with each one created for just the individual song, and without the appearance of being a recording of a live performance. 

The Beatles were also the source of a number of controversies and conspiracy theories. John Lennon was quoted in 1966 as saying the Beatles were ""more popular than Jesus Christ"", causing protests in many parts of the USA; although he publicly apologized for the statement, he also later claimed it was a contributing factor in the Beatles ending touring. 

A widespread urban legend that started in 1969 claimed that Paul McCartney was dead and had been replaced by a lookalike. The rumor was referred to by members of the Beatles a number of times, including John Lennon's song ""How Do You Sleep?"".
   
George Harrison passed away in 2001. His death was marked by a large concert event in the Albert Hall. The Concert for George took place a year to the day of George's death. Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney continue to make music. Ringo released Choose Love and Paul released Chaos and Creation in the Backyard both in 2005. Paul's latest release is 2007's Memory Almost Full. Also in 2008 Ringo released Liverpool 8.

George Harrison once said “The Beatles will exist without us.” Deftly short and simple, this quote surmises their legacy, showing how The Beatles as an entity transcends not only the music or entertainment industry, but even the members themselves. 
     
In 2006, a collaboration between Apple Corps, and Cirque du Soleil, culminated in a show called Love, showing only in Las Vegas. Starr, McCartney, Ono and Harrison's widow, Olivia, all were involved in the production. The accompanying album is composed of new takes on original Beatles recordings, spliced together and creating new feels for several of their songs. The project was put together by renowned Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles.  
     
The tracks in ""Love"" contain parts from original Beatles demo recordings, and George Martin created a new orchestral arrangement for an acoustic demo version of Harrison's ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"". 

In October 2007, Across the Universe, a musical film which incorporated Beatles songs into its narrative, was released in cinemas to mixed reviews. The film incorporates, and indeed appears to be built around, various songs throughout the Beatles' career, sung by the principles. Songs such as ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""Dear Prudence"" actually tell the story at hand, while songs such as ""Let it Be"" and ""Across the Universe"" seem instead to provide a background or atmosphere around which the story is built. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Kanye West,"Kanye Omari West (born June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia) is a Grammy award winning rapper, producer, author, designer and singer. 

He began making beats and rapping in the early 90s in Chicago, IL, United States when he formed the rap group Go Getters with Chicago natives GLC and Really Doe. He later gained nationwide popularity in New York when he began producing tracks for artists such as Jay-Z, Twista, Mase, Talib Kweli and Alicia Keys. 

West’s style of production often utilizes pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul songs, with his own drums and instruments. The first major label song he produced was The Truth by Beanie Sigel, and his first major release featuring his trademark vocal sampling style was This Can’t Be Life, a track from Jay-Z’s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West said he sped up the drum beat of Dr. Dre’s Xxplosive to use as a replacement for his drums on This Can’t Be Life.

West has said that Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA influenced him in his style, and has said on numerous occasions that Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah and Ol’ Dirty Bastard were some of his all-time favorites. Said by Kanye West: “Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time… We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the [production] style I use, RZA has been doing that.”

In 2004 (after being pushed aside by many record companies who felt he wasn't a marketable hip hop artist), he managed to release his debut solo album, The College Dropout on Roc-A-Fella Records. The album received critical acclaim, defining the style for which West would become known: ""wordplay"" and heavy sampling of 70s soul and RnB tracks. He is also known for his politically-charged rhymes and controversial behavior both inside and outside the realms of music.

He has since released five more albums, all of which have received numerous awards, high commercial success and critical acclaim. Late Registration (2005); Graduation (2007); 808s & Heartbreak (2008); My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010); Yeezus (2013).

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to rave reviews from critics, many of whom described it as his best work that solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark Fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit All of the Lights, and Billboard hits Power, Monster, and Runaway, the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name. During this time, West initiated the free music program G.O.O.D. Fridays through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday of the week, a portion of which were included on the album. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a ""snub"" by several media outlets.

Following a headlining set at Coachella 2011 that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as ""one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time,"" West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z. By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak. Niggas in Paris became the record's highest charting single, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2012, West released the compilation album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks by artists from West's record label GOOD Music. Cruel Summer produced four singles, two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100: Mercy and Clique. West also directed a film of the same name that premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens.

Sessions for West's sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft's living room at a Paris hotel. Determined to ""undermine the commercial,"" he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Primarily inspired by architecture, West's perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach. Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances.

Yeezus, West's sixth album, was released June 18, 2013 to rave reviews from critics. It became the rapper's sixth consecutive number one debut. Def Jam issued ""Black Skinhead"" to radio in July 2013 as the album's lead single. On September 6, 2013, Kanye West announced he would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support Yeezus, with fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar, accompanying him along the way.

In November 2013, West stated that he was working on and recording his next studio album. The album is being produced by Rick Rubin and Q-Tip. In April 2014, he appeared in Future's new single titled I Won. Kanye released the first single from the album on December 31, 2014 entitled Only One. All Day the second single from Kanye's new album was released on March 2, 2015. West had originally stated the album would be called 'So Help Me God' but in May, 2015, changed the album title to 'SWISH'. 

Personal life:
West was born in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was three years old (as mentioned in Hey Mama) his parents divorced, and he moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, was a former Black Panther; one of the first black photojournalists at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution; and is now a Christian counselor. Kanye’s late mother, Dr. Donda West, worked as a Professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as Kanye’s manager. He was later raised in an upper middle class background, attending Polaris High School in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois after living in Chicago.

After attending The American Academy of Art, a Chicago art school, West attended Chicago State University but eventually dropped out due to poor grades and in order to continue working on his music career. While attending school, West produced for local artists, including on rapper Grav’s debut album Down to Earth. He later gained fame by producing hit singles for major hip hop/R&B artists, including Jay-Z, Talib Kweli, Cam’ron, Paul Wall, Common, Mobb Deep, Jermaine Dupri, Scarface, The Game, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson and John Legend among others. He also “ghost-produced” for his once mentor Deric Angelettie according to his song Last Call and the credits of Nas’ Poppa Was a Playa.

Kanye is married to Kim Kardashian. They have one child together named North.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Arctic Monkeys,"Arctic Monkeys are an indie rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.

The band has released five studio albums, ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"" (2006), ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" (2007), ""Humbug"" (2009), ""Suck It and See"" (2011) and ""AM"" (2013), all of which debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart. 

Each of the band's first five singles I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor, When the Sun Goes Down, Leave Before The Lights Come On, Brianstorm and Fluorescent Adolescent hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, Teddy Picker, only went Top 20 and their seventh single, Crying Lightning peaked at #12.

The band's rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs which had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website.  The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical 'commercial' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK's (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.

The band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis's album Spirit.

On 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to 'fatigue' and the other band members couldn't stand the constant 'missing his girlfriend syndrome' so told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist,  Nick O'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band's remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson's permanent replacement. 

The single Leave Before The Lights Come On came out on August 14th, but only reached Number 4 on the UK charts, denying the band a third consecutive number 1 single.

Their debut album ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"" won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.

Their second album Favourite Worst Nightmare was released on April 23rd 2007. It was preceded by ""Brianstorm"", the first single from the album, which was released a week before. Like its predecessor, ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" sold more than the rest of the Top 20 combined, and - due to an error on iTunes - every song on the record appeared on the UK Top 200 Singles the next week.

When asked about Favourite Worst Nightmare Alex Turner commented, ""We haven't changed that much. It's still about making contact with girls or not making contact with girls"".

The band began to write and record demos for the third album in January 2008, Turner said ""We had tunes that we'd already been playing on tour so we recorded them. That’s six [songs]. We’re going to take it easy and start practicing over the summer and doing new stuff.""

The band premiered new material from the unreleased album during their January 2009 tour of New Zealand, playing small venues in Wellington and Auckland ahead of the Big Day Out festival. Their first show in more than a year was on January 13, 2009 at Wellington's Town Hall. In both cities, the new songs played were ""Crying Lightning"", ""Go-Kart"", ""Dangerous Animals"" and ""Pretty Visitors."" The full set list from the Auckland gig is available online. Also played was a cover of the Nick Cave song ""Red Right Hand."" During their last tour, the band had played new songs ""Put Me In A Terror Pocket"", ""Sandtrap,"" and ""The Fire and The Thud"" live.

Lead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the singer from the Rascals, Miles Kane.
The band is called 'The Last Shadow Puppets'

The band released their new album Humbug in August of 2009, preceded by the single "" Crying Lightning""

They released their fourth studio album, entitled Suck It And See on June 6th 2011

Kings of Leon,"Kings of Leon is an American rock band that formed in Nashville, Tennessee, United States in 1999, consisting of brothers Anthony ""Caleb"" Followill (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Ivan ""Nathan"" Followill (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and Michael ""Jared"" Followill (bass guitar, backing vocals), with their cousin Cameron ""Matthew"" Followill (lead guitar, backing vocals). Each member of the family group is known by their middle name (second given name) as opposed to their first given name.

The band's early music was an upbeat blend of southern rock and blues influences but the band has gradually expanded their sound to include a variety of genres, including alternative rock.

Kings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards in 2008, and all three of the band's albums at the time peaking in the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album Because of the Times also reached the number one spot. After the release of Only by the Night in 2008 they finally achieved chart success in their native United States. The singles Sex on Fire, Use Somebody and Notion peaked at number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, while the album itself was their first ever platinum-selling album in the US. 

Early years (1999–2002)
The three Followill brothers spent much of their youth traveling around the Southern United States with their father, Ivan ""Leon"" Followill, a traveling Pentecostal Church preacher and their mother, Betty-Ann, who taught them when they were not in school. Caleb and Jared were both born in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, while Nathan and Matthew were born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. According to Rolling Stone magazine, ""While Leon preached at churches and tent revivals throughout the Deep South, the boys attended services and were occasionally enlisted to bang on some drums. They were either home-schooled or enrolled in small parochial schools at this time. Except for a five-year period when they settled in Jackson, Tennessee, the Followill's childhoods were spent driving through the south in a purple 1988 Oldsmobile, decamping for a week or two wherever Leon was scheduled to preach.""

When the boys' father resigned from the church and divorced his wife in 1997, the boys relocated to Nashville and embraced the rock music and lifestyle they had previously been denied. While there, they met songwriter Angelo Petraglia, who helped the siblings hone their songwriting skills and introduced them to the musical influences of the Rolling Stones, The Clash, and Thin Lizzy in particular. Six months later, Nathan and Caleb signed with RCA Records, who insisted that the duo recruit more members for the band before launching their career. The band was formed when cousin Matthew and younger brother Jared were asked to join. They named themselves Kings of Leon in honor of Nathan, Caleb, and Jared's father and grandfather, who were both named Leon.

In an interview, Caleb admitted to ""kidnapping"" their cousin Matthew from his hometown in Mississippi in order for him to join the band. They told his mother that he was just staying for a week, but they consequently never allowed him to return home. Drummer Nathan added, ""When we signed the deal with RCA, it was just me and Caleb. The label told us they were going to put a band together, but we said, 'We're going to buy our little brother a bass, he's a freshman in high school. Caleb will teach himself the guitar. Our cousin Matthew played guitar when he was 10 and I'll play drums.' The record label agreed,"". 

Youth and Young Manhood and Aha Shake Heartbreak (2003 - 2005)
Their first record, the Holy Roller Novocaine EP was released on February 18, 2003. At this stage, Jared was only 16 years old and had not yet learned to play the bass guitar. The release of Holy Roller Novocaine gave the Kings of Leon a significant amount of exposure prior to the release of their debut album, Youth and Young Manhood, receiving a 4/5 star rating from Rolling Stone magazine. Four of the five songs would later be released on Youth and Young Manhood, however the versions of Wasted Time and California Waiting on the EP differ, with the first having a more tense riff and different vocal style than the same track off Youth and Young Manhood, and the latter being recorded in a rush to finish the record. The EP contains the B-side Wicker Chair while another track titled Andrea, was discarded prior to its release. All the songs released on the EP were co-written by Angelo Petraglia who also produced the record.

The band's debut studio album, Youth and Young Manhood was released in the UK in July 2003, and in the United States in August of the same year. The album was recorded between Sound City Studios in Los Angeles and Shangri-La Studios in Malibu, California, with producer Ethan Johns (son of producer Glyn Johns who most notably worked with the Rolling Stones and the Eagles). The album received some critical notice domestically, but became a sensation in the UK and Ireland, where NME declared it ""one of the best debut album of the last 10 years"". Following the release of the album, Kings of Leon was chosen to tour with fellow American rock band The Strokes and U2.

The band's second album Aha Shake Heartbreak was released in the UK in October 2004 and in the United States in February 2005. Building on the southern-infused garage rock of their first album, the album broadened the band's domestic and international audience. The album was again produced by Angelo Petraglia and Ethan Johns. The Bucket, Four Kicks, and King of the Rodeo were all released as singles, with the ""The Bucket"" rising into the Top 20 in Britain. Taper Jean Girl was also used in the 2007 movie Disturbia and the movie Cloverfield in 2008. The band garnered accolades from several of their rock peers, including Elvis Costello, and also toured with Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam during 2005 and 2006.

Because of the Times (2006–07)
In March 2006, Kings of Leon were back in the studio with their producers Angelo Petraglia and Ethan Johns, working on their third album. Guitarist Matthew told NME: ""Man, we're sitting on a bunch of songs right now that we wish we could let the world hear"". The band's third album was titled Because of the Times, which may be a reference to a church ministers conference of the same name held at The Pentecostals of Alexandria church in Alexandria, Louisiana that the brothers often attended. The album showed a clear evolution from Kings of Leon's previous work, as the band's trademark dirty, southern-fried swagger was replaced with a more polished, clean-cut sound.

The album was released on April 2, 2007 in the UK, and a day later in the United States, preceded by the single On Call, which became a hit in Britain and Ireland. It debuted at number one in Britain and Ireland and entered the European charts at number twenty-five, selling approximately 70,000 copies in its first week of release. NME said that the album ""cements Kings of Leon as one of the great American bands of our times."" and Entertainment Weekly called Because of the Times ""an epic wide-screen movie of a CD and the band's best to date."" However, some critics found the album inferior to their previous efforts. Stylus Magazine rated it a C- and noted ""If they wanted us to take them serious this time around, they'd at least try to be right honest about their ascent into minor celebrity and not keep on with the yokel façade. Without cautionary yarns regarding life on the tour bus or banging supermodels, the bright-eyed, legs-stretched mood of the music rings just as hollow."" Dave Hood of Artrocker gave the album one star out of five, finding that ""Kings of Leon are experimenting, learning, and getting a bit lost."" Pitchfork Media contended that ""Because of the Times sounds suspiciously like a counterattack on womankind, launched from somewhere in the mid-1990s, deep inside a bruised, stadium-sized ego.""

In spite of the mixed recognition, the album spawned a number of hit singles in Europe, including Charmer and Fans, along with a number of crowd favorites such as Knocked Up and My Party.

Only by the Night (2008–09)
After recording throughout most of 2008, ""the all American long haired rockers"" (The Times), released their fourth studio album Only by the Night on September 19, which subsequently entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and remained there for one more week. Only By The Night also had two single week stints as the UK #1 album in 2009, one directly after the BRIT Awards. In the United States, the album reached number 5 on the Billboard Charts. Reception to the album was the most polarized yet, with the British press granting the album glowing reviews. Q Magazine named Only by the Night ""Album of the Year"" for 2008. In the United States, reactions to the album were more mixed. Spin, Rolling Stone, and All Music Guide gave the album positive reviews, while Pitchfork Media gave the album a virtual equivalent of 2 stars. The album was officially named as the UK's third biggest selling album of 2008 and the biggest selling album of 2008 in Australia. Sex on Fire was the first single released for download in the UK on 8 September. The song became their most successful ever as it peaked at number one in the UK and in Ireland. It was also their first song to chart number one on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock chart. The second single to be released from the album on December 8, 2008 was Use Somebody which achieved worldwide chart success and consistency, such as peaking at number two in the UK Singles Chart, and also reaching top ten chart positions in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States. The album's popularity in Australia was confirmed with a total of four singles being voted into the world's largest online music poll, the ""Triple J Hottest 100"". The song Crawl came in at number 70, Closer was voted number 24 and ""Use Somebody"" finished number 3 in the poll. However, their biggest success from Only By The Night was ""Sex on Fire"" which was voted number 1 in the Hottest 100 poll for 2008 and number 90 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009 poll. ""Sex on Fire"" also won the band a Grammy Award at the 51st Grammy Awards held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on February 8, 2009. They won Best International Band and Best International Album at the Brit Awards in 2009, where they also performed ""Use Somebody"" live. Kings of Leon also performed on 14 March 2009 at Sound Relief, a benefit concert, for the Victorian Bushfire Crisis. The song ""Crawl"" from this album was released as a free download on the band's website on July 28. The third and fourth singles were Revelry, which peaked at number 19 in New Zealand and Notion, which peaked at number 24 in Belgian charts. Only By The Night was certified platinum in the United States by the RIAA for selling one million copies in less than a year after its release.

In 2009, the band headlined a number of music festivals, including Reading & Leeds, Rock Werchter, Oxegen, T In The Park, Gurtenfestival and Open'er Festival in Europe, along with Sasquatch, Lollapalooza, and Austin City Limits in the United States. That same year, the band won their first Grammy Award for the single ""Sex on Fire"", as well as two BRIT Awards for ""Best International Group"" and ""Best International Album."" The album Only by the Night also won an NME Award for ""Album of the Year.""

Future projects (2009-2011)
The band has announced the release of a live DVD on November 10, 2009 and a remix album due for release in the coming months, though the latter is untitled and unscheduled at the moment. The DVD was filmed at London's O2 Arena in July 2009. In an interview with Billboard.com drummer Nathan stated, ""England is really the first place we broke ... We figured what better place to make a live DVD than where the fans have been the craziest for the longest?"" The show featured some choice rarities, and Nathan continued by saying ""we just put the cameras in the back of our minds and acted like they weren't even there."" The remix album came to life after Kings of Leon learned that other artists had started working on revisions of the band's songs. Mark Ronson, Kenna, Lykke Li with her cover of ""Knocked Up"", and Linkin Park are also contributing a remix to the album.

On October 17, 2009, the night of the final show of the US tour in Nashville, Tennessee, Nathan Followill posted ""Now it's time to start creating the next musical chapter in the novel that is Kings of Leon. Thanks again to all. Boomer fucking Sooner."" on his personal Twitter page.

Mechanical Bull (2012-2013):
The band's sixth LP, ""Mechanical Bull"", was released on September 24, 2013. The album's first single, entitled ""Supersoaker"", was released on July 17, 2013.

Walls (2016):
On Oct 14, 2016, Kings of Leon released their 7th studio album, ""Walls"", on the RCA Records label. It became the band's first number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The first single released from the album was ""Waste a Moment"".

Controversy
Kings of Leon caused controversy at the 2009 Reading Festival when Caleb Followill tried to get the crowd going by asking ""I thought this was supposed to be the loudest crowd in the world?"" Picking up on a perceived hostility towards the band, he announced ""we know you're sick of Kings of Leon, so for all those who don't give a fuck about us, I understand. But we've worked fucking hard to get here. So anyone that has anything to say to us, fuck you. We're the goddamn Kings of Leon."" The band later smashed their guitars in anger and made rude gestures before leaving the stage. Nathan Followill further criticized the Reading crowd on his twitter page, declaring ""Zero love for the kings. I know it was cold but holy shit, y'all were frozen. I can only hope Leeds is in better form."". At the Leeds Festival Caleb again bad-mouthed Reading while complimenting the Leeds crowd declaring ""We're only five songs in and you've blown Reading to hell"", while complimenting UK crowds in general stating ""It was the UK that made us feel like we could take on the world.""

Queen,"Queen were an English rock band originally consisting of four members: vocalist Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, bass guitarist John Deacon, and drummer Roger Taylor.

The band formed in London in 1970 after May and Taylor's former band Smile split after having released an album and single. Freddie replaced lead vocalist Tim Staffell, after the latter's departure from the original trio. 

There was much deliberation as to what the band's name would be. May and Taylor had settled upon the Grand Dance, derived from a C.S. Lewis Trilogy of books Out Of The Silent Planet.

Ultimately, the band went with Queen, a name that was entirely Freddie's. Originally Roger and, especially, Brian did not like the name, though Mercury would eventually persuade them both that it was ""right"" for the band.

""Years ago I thought up the name Queen... It's just a name, but it's very regal, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it. ""
- Freddie Mercury.

Queen went through several bass players before  a young electronics major by the name of John Deacon arrived on the scene in January of 1971. 

""Until John, it had been exploding bass player syndrome. If they musically worked they'd look all wrong, and if they felt all right they couldn't play. - Brian May.

This quite shy guy turned up with his immaculate Rickenbacker bass and immaculate amplifier, plugged in, and as soon as he started playing we realized it was right."" - Brian May.

Later that year, the band was secured recording time at the newly built De Lane Lea studio, and used the opportunity to record several songs that would later appear on their debut album - Liar, Keep Yourself Alive, Jesus, and The Night Comes Down.  The demo reel was passed around from producer to producer with little success, until a staff member of Trident records by the name of Roy Thomas Baker was introduced to the band by fellow Trident producer John Anthony. Baker dropped in to watch the band at work and, clearly liking what he heard, recommended Queen to his superiors. 

It was eventually agreed upon that the fledgling band could record at Trident studios, though after already-established artists had finished their work, such as the likes of Elton John and David Bowie. Relegated to the wee hours of the morning to record the remaining tracks of their first album, the band nonetheless stuck it out until they reached their ultimate goal of ""perfection"".

Queen's self-titled debut album was released in 1973 and received little attention from the general public. They quickly followed it a year later with a second album, ""Queen II"" which also failed to generate much interest from music fans in Britain, despite the success of the album's single, Seven Seas of Rhye, which would reach #10 on the charts after the band's mimed appearance on Top of the Pops. 

The band's second album was recorded with a higher budget than the first, and the band threw everything they had into recording it. Queen II was somewhat of a ""concept album"", split into ""White Side"" vs. ""Black Side"". 

As was in their nature, the band pressed onward after the mediocre success of their first two albums, immersing themselves in a world-wide tour to promote Queen II. Queen played in America for the first time, as a support act for Mott the Hoople.

Sheer Heart Attack would be released later that year, focusing more on being accessible to listeners, than the grand and complex ideas of the previous two albums. The recording of their third album was met with some hardships, as May fell victim to a series of illnesses brought on by an infected inoculation, required for the band's rigorous touring schedule. 

Sheer Heart Attack brought even more success for the band, with May's Now I'm Here and the song that would be the band's ""turning point"", the Mercury-penned Killer Queen, the latter of which would reach #2 on the UK charts.

During this time, the band began developing a huge following in Japan and witnessed their popularity for themselves when they visited the country, mainly in 1975, to promote their fourth and most famous album ""A Night At The Opera"", featuring the epic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".

Queen's popularity grew steadily through the latter half of the 70s as they released hit album after hit album, reaching its peak in the mid-80s after their ""Live Aid"" appearance, and continuing into the early 90s before Mercury's untimely death on 24th November 1991. The official cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.

Over the course of their 30 year career, the band did sound tracks for two films (""Flash Gordon"" and ""Highlander""), released a string of live and studio albums, and had many many fans across the world.

In 1995, 4 years after Mercury's death, the band released the album ""Made In Heaven"". This album saw the surviving band members in the studio completing or reworking unused vocals, unreleased variations of Freddie solo material (a Queen version of ""I Was Born To Love You"" for example), and tracks where Brian and Roger added lyrics to flesh out a song (""Mother Love""). 

Queen have been on indefinite hiatus since 1997, when John Deacon decided to retire.


Several ""Queen + ..."" projects have been developed in the following years, a few of them mere remixes with no artistic involvement from the band. In 1999, a ""Greatest Hits III"" album was released. This featured, among others, ""Queen + Wyclef Jean"" on a rap version of ""Another One Bites the Dust"", a live version of ""Somebody to Love"" performed by George Michael, and a live version of ""The Show Must Go On"" performed live in 1997 with Elton John.

Brian May and Roger Taylor have performed together as Queen on several occasions (award ceremonies, charity concerts, and the like), sharing vocals with various guest singers. They have also recorded several covers of Queen's hits with guest vocalists, including ""We Will Rock You"" (first with Five and later Britney Spears, Beyonce, John Farnham and P!nk) and ""We Are the Champions"" (with Robbie Williams).

On the 14th of May 2002 the Queen musical 'We Will Rock You'  opened in the Dominion theatre in London's 'West End'. A Musical about young people in the distant future who aren't allowed to listen to music not generated by computers. Various Queen songs are used in the story, played by a live band. This live band was supported by Brian May and Roger Taylor on the premiere evening.

At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be 'featured with' Queen as 'Queen + Paul Rodgers', not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.

Between 2005 and 2006 Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, the first leg in Europe and the second, Japan and then the US in 2006. On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a ""secret location"". The album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the album the band again embarked on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The show in Ukraine was later released on DVD.

Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009. Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working together again.

The Rolling Stones,"The Rolling Stones are an English rock group that formed in London in 1962. First popular in Europe, they quickly became successful in North America during the ""British Invasion"" of the mid-60s. Since then, their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004, they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on ""The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists"", and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ian Stewart, who met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called ""Rollin' Stone Blues"", and made their live debut at London's Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier).

In January 1963, Charlie Watts  joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer's Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham.  Their weekly performances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond's Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the ""Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone"" press campaign, which set the tone for their career.

In May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later ""Come On"", the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.

The fifth member of the group, Brian Jones, left on 8th June 1969, saying that he wanted to form a new group. He was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.

In 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label.  In December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career.  He was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood.

Since Wyman left the Stones in 1993, the band has consisted of Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood. In studio and live performances, Darryl Jones (bassist) and Chuck Leavell (keyboardist) also serve as a regular contributors. 

In 2005, the band released ""A Bigger Bang"". 

On December 2, 2016, the band released their first studio album in over 10 days, entitled ""Blue & Lonesome"" (2016) on the Polydor label. 

All the members have also undertaken solo projects of various kinds. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Ariana Grande,"Ariana Grande (born Ariana Grande-Butera, June 26, 1993 in Boca Raton, Florida, United States), is an American Grammy award-nominated actress, singer, and songwriter. Beginning by taking a part in the Broadway musical 13 in 2008, Grande later landed the role Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon hit TV shows Victorious (2010-2013), and its spin off, Sam & Cat (2013-2014).

Grande reached mainstream success in March 2013 after her debut single ""The Way"" (featuring Mac Miller) from her debut studio album Yours Truly (2013), became a Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit. The album also debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 138,000 copies.

In August 2014, Grande released her second studio album My Everything, which became her second number one album in the US with 169,000 copies sold first week. Its lead single, ""Problem"" (featuring Iggy Azalea), reached number two on Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. With four Top 10 hit singles from the album, Grande spent 34 continuous weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and had the most top 10 singles of any artist in 2014. All of five singles from My Everything were certified Platinum or better by RIAA.

In October 2015, Grande released the lead single from her upcoming third studio album, Focus, which became her first song to crack into the Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 without a company artist. Grande also became the first artist in history to have all of three lead singles from three first albums to debut in the Top 10 Hot 100 with The Way, Problem, and Focus.

Grande has released Christmas music every winter since her career debut, Christmas Kisses (2013), which included ""Santa Tell Me"" (2014) in the exclusive re-release in Japan, and Christmas & Chill (2015), which debuted at number thirty-four on Billboard 200 chart with 27,000 digital copies. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Pink Floyd,"Pink Floyd are a psychedelic/progressive rock band formed in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom in 1965. Pink Floyd is one of rock's most successful and influential acts, having sold over 200 million albums worldwide and with 74.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time. Currently the band consists of David Gilmour (vocals, guitar) and Nick Mason (drums).

The band's classic lineup was Roger Waters (vocals, bass), David Gilmour (vocals, guitar), Rick Wright (organ, keyboards, vocals) and Nick Mason (drums). Gilmour was brought into the band in 1968 to replace the band's founder, singer, guitarist and songwriter Syd Barrett, who had become increasingly erratic and departed from the band a few months after Gilmour's addition. The band became known for their advancements in the genres of psychedelic rock and progressive rock music, philosophical lyrics, avant-garde compositions, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art and elaborate live shows. 

Pink Floyd enjoyed modest success in the late-1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett. Barrett’s increasingly erratic behavior eventually caused his colleagues to replace him after The Piper at the Gates Of Dawn with guitarist David Gilmour. The band went on to record several elaborate concept albums; achieving worldwide success with 1973’s The Dark Side of the Moon (The second best-selling album of all time), 1975’s Wish You Were Here, 1977’s Animals, and 1979’s The Wall, among the best-selling, most critically acclaimed, and enduringly popular albums in rock music history. In 1985, singer and bassist Roger Waters declared Pink Floyd defunct. However, the remaining members continued recording and touring under the name, eventually reaching a settlement with Waters giving them rights to the name and most of the songs.

Pink Floyd evolved from an earlier band, formed in 1964, which was at various times called Sigma 6, The Meggadeaths, The Screaming Abdabs, and The Abdabs. When this band split up, some members — guitarists Bob Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright — formed a new band called Tea Set, and were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist Syd Barrett, who became the band’s primary vocalist as well. When Tea Set found themselves on the same bill as another band with the same name, Barrett came up with an alternative name on the spur of the moment, choosing The Pink Floyd Sound (after two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). For a time after this they oscillated between ‘Tea Set’ and ‘The Pink Floyd Sound’, with the latter name eventually winning out. The word Sound was dropped fairly quickly, but the definite article was still used occasionally for several years afterward, up to about the time of the More soundtrack. In the early days, the band covered rhythm and blues staples such as “Louie, Louie”, but gained notoriety for psychedelic interpretations, with extended improvised sections and ‘spaced out’ solos.

The heavily jazz-oriented Klose left the band to become a photographer shortly before Pink Floyd started recording, leaving an otherwise stable lineup with Barrett on lead guitar, Waters on bass guitar, Mason on drums and Wright switching to keyboards. Barrett started writing his own songs, influenced by American and British psychedelic rock with his own brand of whimsical humor. Pink Floyd became a favorite in the underground movement, playing at such prominent venues as the UFO club, the Marquee Club and the Roundhouse. As their popularity increased, the band members formed Blackhill Enterprises in October 1966, a six-way business partnership with their managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, issuing the singles ""Arnold Layne"" in March 1967 and “See Emily Play” in June 1967. “Arnold Layne” reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and “See Emily Play” reached number 6, granting the band its first TV appearance on Top of the Pops in July 1967.

Released in August 1967, the band’s debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, is today considered to be a prime example of British psychedelic music, and was generally well-received by critics at the time, and it is now viewed as one of the better debut albums by many critics. The album’s tracks, predominantly written by Barrett, showcase poetic lyrics and an eclectic mixture of music, from the avant-garde free-form piece ""Interstellar Overdrive"" to whimsical songs such as ""The Scarecrow"", inspired by the Fenlands, a rural region north of Cambridge (Barrett, Gilmour and Waters’s home town). Lyrics were entirely surreal and often referred to folklore, such as ""The Gnome"". The music reflected newer technologies in electronics through its prominent use of stereo panning and electric keyboards. The album was a hit in the UK where it peaked at #6, but did not get much attention in North America, reaching #131 in the U.S. During this period, the band toured with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which helped to increase its popularity.

As the band became more and more popular, the stresses of life on the road and a significant intake of psychedelic drugs took their toll on Barrett, whose mental health had been deteriorating for several months. While Barrett’s behavior has often been attributed to his drug use, there are many who think that a pre-existing condition, possibly schizophrenia, was equally to blame. In January 1968, guitarist David Gilmour joined the band to carry out Syd’s playing and singing duties. With Barrett’s behavior becoming less and less predictable, and his almost constant use of LSD, he became very unstable, often staring into space while the rest of the band performed. During some performances, he would simply strum one chord for the duration of a concert, or simply begin detuning his guitar. The band’s live shows became increasingly ramshackle until, eventually, the other band members simply stopped taking him to the concerts. It was originally hoped that Syd would write for the band with Gilmour performing live, similar to how the Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson. However, due to Barrett’s increasingly difficult compositions, such as ""Have You Got It Yet?”, which changed melodies and chord progression with every take, eventually made the rest of the band give up on this arrangement. Once Barrett’s departure was formalized in April 1968, producers Jenner and King decided to remain with him, and the six-way Blackhill partnership was dissolved. The band adopted Steve O’Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd until his death in 2003.

Musically, this period was one of experimentation for the band. Gilmour, Waters and Wright each contributed material that had its own voice and sound, giving this material less consistency than the Barrett-dominated early years or the more polished, collaborative sound of later years. Waters mostly wrote low-key, jazzy melodies with dominant bass lines and complex, symbolic lyrics, Gilmour focused on guitar-driven blues jams, and Wright preferred melodic psychedelic keyboard-heavy numbers. Unlike Waters, Gilmour and Wright preferred tracks that had simple lyrics or that were purely instrumental. Some of the band’s most experimental music is from this period, such as ""A Saucerful of Secrets"", consisting largely of feedback and atonal screeches and loops, “Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict”, which is a series of sped-up voice samples resembling rodents chattering that reaches its climax in an incomprehensible Scottish dialect monologue, and “Careful with That Axe, Eugene” (performed under different names during this period), a very Waters-driven song with a bass and keyboard-heavy jam culminating in crashing drums and Waters’s primal screams.

Whilst Barrett had written the bulk of the first album, only one Barrett composition, the Piper outtake “Jugband Blues”, appeared on the second Floyd album. A Saucerful of Secrets was released in June 1968, reaching #9 in the UK and becoming the only Pink Floyd album not to chart in the U.S. Somewhat uneven due to Barrett’s departure, the album still contained much of his psychedelic sound combined with the more experimental music that would be fully showcased on Ummagumma. Hints of the epic, lengthy songs to come are in its centerpiece, the 12-minute title track, but the album was poorly received by critics at the time, although critics today tend to be kinder to the album in the context of their body of work. Future Floyd albums would expand upon the idea of long, sprawling compositions, offering more focused songwriting with each subsequent release.

Pink Floyd were then recruited by director Barbet Schroeder to produce a soundtrack for his film, More, which premiered in May 1969. The music was released as a Floyd album in its own right, Music From the Film More, in July 1969; the album achieved another #9 finish in the UK, and peaked at #153 in the U.S. The band would use this and future soundtrack recording sessions to produce work that may not have fit into the idea of what would appear on a proper Pink Floyd LP; many of the tracks on More (as fans usually call it) were acoustic folk songs, although critics tend to find the collection of the film’s music patchy and uneven. Two of these songs, “Green Is the Colour” and “Cymbaline”, became fixtures in the band’s live sets for a time, as can be heard in the many available bootleg recordings from this period. The latter was also the first Pink Floyd song to deal with Roger Waters’s cynical attitude toward the music industry explicitly. The rest of the album consisted of incidental music with a few heavier rock songs thrown in, such as “The Nile Song”.

The next record, the double album Ummagumma, was a mix of live recordings and unchecked studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project (Mason’s first wife makes an uncredited contribution as a flautist). Though the album was realized as solo outings and a live set, it was originally intended as a purely avant-garde mixture of sounds from “found” instruments. The subsequent difficulties in recording and lack of group organization led to the shelving of the project. The title is slang for sexual procreation, and reflects the attitude of the band at the time, as frustrations in the studio followed them throughout these sessions. Wildly experimental on the studio disc (except for Waters’s pure folk “Grantchester Meadows”), with atonal and jarring piano pieces (“Sysyphus”), meandering folk guitar (“The Narrow Way”) and large percussion solos, the live disc featured excellent performances of some of their most popular psychedelic-era compositions and caused critics to receive the album more positively than the previous two albums. With fans, the album was Pink Floyd’s most popular release yet, hitting UK #5 and making the U.S. charts at #74.

1970’s Atom Heart Mother, the band’s first recording with an orchestra, was a collaboration with avant-garde composer Ron Geesin. One side of the album consisted of the title piece, a 23-minute long rock-orchestral suite. The second side featured one song from each of the band’s then-current vocalists (Roger Waters’s folk-rock “If”, David Gilmour’s bluesy “Fat Old Sun” and Rick Wright’s psychedelic “Summer ‘68”). Another lengthy piece, “Alan’s Psychedelic Breakfast”, was a sound collage of a man cooking and eating breakfast and his thoughts on the matter, linked with instrumentals. The use of incidental sound effects and voice samples would thereafter be an important part of the band’s sound. While Atom Heart Mother was considered a huge step back for the band at the time and is still considered one of its most inaccessible albums, it had the best chart performance for the band so far, reaching #1 in the UK and #55 in the U.S., although it has since been described by Gilmour as ""a load of rubbish"" and Waters as suitable for ""throwing in the dustbin and never [being] listened to by anyone ever again."" The album was another transitional piece for the group, hinting at future musical territory such as “Echoes” in its ambitious title track. The popularity of the album allowed Pink Floyd to embark on its first full U.S. tour. Before releasing its next original album, the band released a compilation album, Relics, which contained several early singles and B-sides, along with one original song (Waters’s jazzy “Biding My Time”).

This is the period in which the Floyd shed their association with the “psychedelic” scene (and its association with Barrett) and became a distinctive band that are difficult to classify. The divergent styles of Gilmour, Waters and Wright (Mason’s writing contributions to the group were minimal) were merged into a unique sound. This era contains what many consider to be two of the band’s masterpiece albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. The sound became polished and collaborative, with the philosophic lyrics and distinctive bass lines of Waters combining with the unique blues guitar style of Gilmour and Wright’s light keyboard melodies. Gilmour was the dominant vocalist throughout this period, and female choirs and Dick Parry’s saxophone contributions in the studio became a notable part of the band’s style. The sometimes atonal and harsh sound exhibited in the band’s earlier years gave way to a very smooth, mellow and soothing sound, and the band’s epic, lengthy compositions reached their zenith with “Echoes” from Meddle (although “Shine On You Crazy Diamond” exceeded it in total length, it was split in two pieces as the opening and closing of Wish You Were Here). This period was not only the beginning but the end of the truly collaborative era of the band; after 1975 Waters’s influence became more dominant musically as well as lyrically. Wright’s last credited composition and last lead vocal on a studio album until 1994’s The Division Bell were in this period, and Gilmour’s writing credits sharply declined in frequency until Waters left the band in 1985. The last ties with Barrett were severed in musical, as well as literal, fashion with Wish You Were Here, whose epic tracks “Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V)”/""Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)"" were written both as a tribute and elegy to their friend.

The band’s sound was considerably more focused on Meddle (1971), with the 23-minute epic “Echoes” taking up the second side of the LP. “Echoes” is a smooth progressive rock song with extended guitar and keyboard solos and a long segue in the middle consisting largely of synthesized whale song produced on guitar, along with samples of seagull cries, described by Waters as a “sonic poem”. Meddle was considered by Nick Mason to be “the first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced the idea of a theme that can be returned to.” The album had the sound and style of the succeeding breakthrough-era Pink Floyd albums but stripped away the orchestra that was prominent in Atom Heart Mother. Meddle also included the atmospheric “One of These Days”, a concert favorite featuring Nick Mason’s menacing one-line vocal (“One of these days, I’m going to cut you into little pieces”), distorted and bluesy slide guitar, and a melody that at one point segues into a throbbing synthetic pulse quoting the theme tune of the cult classic science fiction television show Doctor Who. The mellow feeling of the next three albums is very present on “Fearless”, and this track displays a country influence, as does the prominent pedal steel guitar on “A Pillow of Winds”. The latter track is one of the Floyd’s very few acoustic love songs. Waters’s role as lead songwriter began to take form, with his jazzy “San Tropez” brought to the band practically completed. Meddle was greeted both by critics and fans enthusiastically, and Pink Floyd were rewarded with a #3 album chart peak in the UK; it only reached #70 in U.S. charts, partly because Capitol Records had not provided it with enough publicity support. Today, Meddle remains one of their most well-regarded efforts.

Obscured by Clouds was released in 1972 as the soundtrack to the film La Vallee, another art house film by Barbet Schroeder. This was the band’s first U.S. Top 50 album (where it hit #46), hitting at #6 in the UK. While Mason described the album years later as “sensational”, it is less well-regarded by critics. The lyrics of “Free Four”, the first Pink Floyd song to achieve significant airplay in the U.S., introduced Waters’s ruminations on his father’s death in World War II which would figure in subsequent albums. Two other songs on the album, “Wots…uh, the Deal” and “Childhood’s End”, also hint at themes used in later albums, the former focusing on loneliness and desperation which would come to full fruit in the Roger Waters-led era, and the latter hinting much at the next album, fixated on life, death and the passage of time. “Childhood’s End”, inspired by the Arthur C. Clarke book of the same name, was also Gilmour’s last lyrical contribution for 15 years. The album was, to an extent, stylistically different from the preceding Meddle, with the songs generally being shorter, often taking a somewhat pastoral approach compared to the atmospheric use of sound effects and keyboard on sections of Meddle, and sometimes even running into folk rock, blues rock and piano-driven soft rock (“Burning Bridges”, “The Gold It’s in the…” and “Stay” being the best respective examples for each).

The release of Pink Floyd’s massively successful 1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon, was a watershed moment in the band’s popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968’s “Point Me At The Sky” and was never a hit-single-driven group, but The Dark Side of the Moon featured a U.S. Top 20 single (“Money”). The album became the band’s first #1 on U.S. charts, a huge improvement over its previous recordings. The critically-acclaimed album stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for an unprecedented 741 weeks (including 591 consecutive weeks from 1976 to 1988), establishing a world record and making it one of the top-selling albums of all time. It also remained 301 weeks on UK charts, despite never rising higher than #2 there, and is highly praised by critics. Saxophone forms an important part of the album’s sound, exposing the band’s jazz influences, and female backing vocals play a key role in helping to diversify the album’s texture. For example, straight rock songs such as “Money” and “Time” are placed on either side of mellow pedal steel guitar sounds (reminiscent of Meddle) in “Breathe” and female vocal-laden song “The Great Gig in the Sky” (with Clare Torry on lead vocal), while minimalist instrumental “On the Run” is performed almost entirely on a single synthesizer. Incidental sound effects and snippets of interviews feature alongside the music, many of them taped in the studio. The album’s lyrics and sound attempt to describe the different pressures that everyday life places upon human beings. This concept (conceived by Waters in a band meeting around Mason’s kitchen table) proved a powerful catalyst for the band and together they drew up a list of themes, several of which would be revisited by Waters on later albums, such as “Us and Them“‘s musings on violence and the futility of war, and the themes of insanity and neurosis discussed in “Brain Damage”. The album’s complicated and precise sound engineering by Alan Parsons set new standards for sound fidelity; this trait became a recognizable aspect of the band’s sound and played a part in the lasting chart success of the album, as audiophiles constantly replaced their worn-out copies.

Seeking to capitalize on its newfound fame, the band also released a compilation album, A Nice Pair, which was a gatefold repackaging of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets. It was also during this period that director Adrian Maben released the first Pink Floyd concert film, Live at Pompeii. The original theatrical cut featured footage of the band performing in 1971 at an amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience present (only the film crew and stage staff). Fortuitously, Maben also happened to capture some interviews and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band during recording sessions for Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios, some of which were incorporated alongside other new footage between songs in later versions of Live at Pompeii.

Wish You Were Here, released in 1975, carries an abstract theme of absence: absence of any humanity within the music industry and, most poignantly, the absence of Syd Barrett. Well-known for its popular title track, the album includes the largely instrumental, nine-part song suite “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”, a tribute to Barrett in which the lyrics deal explicitly with the aftermath of his breakdown. Many of the musical influences in the band’s past were brought together — atmospheric keyboards, blues guitar pieces, extended saxophone solos (by Dick Parry), jazz fusion workouts and aggressive slide guitar — in the suite’s different linked parts, culminating in a funeral dirge played with synthesized horn. The remaining tracks on the album, “Welcome to the Machine” and “Have a Cigar”, harshly criticize the music industry; the latter is sung by British folk singer Roy Harper. It was the first Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and the U.S. charts, and critics praise it just as enthusiastically as Dark Side of the Moon. In a famous anecdote, a heavyset man with a completely shaved head and eyebrows wandered into the studio while the band was recording “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”. The band could not recognize him for some time, when suddenly one of them realized it was Syd Barrett. He was greeted enthusiastically by the band but subsequently slipped away during the impromptu party for David Gilmour’s wedding (which was, coincidentally, also on that day). It was the last time any of the other band members saw him. Gilmour recently confirmed this story, although he could not recall which song they were working on when Syd showed up. Barrett’s eyebrow-shaving tendencies would later be revisited in the movie Pink Floyd: The Wall.

During this era, Waters asserted more and more control over Pink Floyd’s output. Wright’s influence became largely inconsequential, and he was fired from the band during the recording of The Wall. Much of the music from this period is considered secondary to the lyrics, which explore Waters’s feelings about his father’s death in World War II and his increasingly cynical attitude towards political figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Mary Whitehouse. Although still finely nuanced, the music grew more guitar-based at the expense of keyboards and saxophone, both of which became (at best) part of the music’s background texture along with the obligatory sound effects. A full orchestra (even larger than the brass ensemble from Atom Heart Mother) plays a significant role on The Wall and especially The Final Cut.

By January 1977, and the release of Animals (UK #2, U.S. #3), the band’s music came under increasing criticism from some quarters in the new punk rock sphere as being too flabby and pretentious, having lost its way from the simplicity of early rock and roll. Animals was, however, considerably more basic-sounding than the previous albums, due to either the influence of the burgeoning punk-rock movement or the fact that the album was recorded at Pink Floyd’s new (and somewhat incomplete) Britannia Row Studios. The album was also the first to not have a single songwriting credit for Rick Wright. Animals again contained lengthy songs tied to a theme, this time taken in part from George Orwell’s Animal Farm, which used “Pigs”, “Dogs” and “Sheep” as metaphors for members of contemporary society. Despite the prominence of guitar, keyboards and synthesizers still play an important role on Animals, but the saxophone and female vocal work that defined much of the previous two albums’ sound is absent. The result is a more hard-rock effort overall, bookended by two parts of a quiet acoustic piece. Many critics did not respond well to the album, finding it “tedious” and “bleak”, although some celebrated it for almost those very reasons. For the cover artwork, a giant inflatable pig was commissioned to float between the chimney towers of London’s Battersea Power Station. However, the wind made the pig balloon difficult to control, and in the end it was necessary to matte a photo of the pig balloon onto the album cover. The pig nevertheless became one of the enduring symbols of Pink Floyd, and inflatable pigs were a staple of the band’s live shows from then on.

1979’s epic rock opera The Wall, conceived by Waters, dealt with the themes of loneliness and failed communication, which were expressed by the metaphor of a wall built between a rock artist and his audience. This album gave Pink Floyd renewed acclaim and another chart-topping single with “Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)”. The Wall also included the future concert staples “Comfortably Numb” and “Run Like Hell”, with the former in particular becoming a cornerstone of album-oriented rock and classic-rock radio playlists as well as one of the group’s best-known songs. The album was co-produced by Bob Ezrin, a friend of Waters who shared songwriting credits on “The Trial” and from whom the band later temporarily distanced themselves after quarreling with him over several contentious issues. Even more than during the Animals sessions, Waters was asserting his artistic influence and leadership over the band, which prompted increased conflicts with the other members. The music had become distinctly more hard-rock, although the large orchestrations on some tracks recalled an earlier period, and there are a few quieter songs interspersed throughout (such as “Goodbye Blue Sky” and “Nobody Home”). Wright’s influence was completely minimized, and he was fired from the band during recording, only returning on a fixed wage for the live shows in support of the album. Ironically, Wright was the only member of Pink Floyd to make any money from The Wall concerts, the rest covering the extensive cost overruns of their most spectacular concerts yet.

Despite never hitting #1 in the UK (it reached #3), The Wall spent 15 weeks atop the U.S. charts during 1980. Critics praised it, and it has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. It is the third-best selling album of all time in the U.S and the best selling album by a single artist to be released during the 1970s. It has been certified 23x platinum by the RIAA, for sales of 11.5 million copies in U.S. alone. The huge commercial success of The Wall made Pink Floyd the only artists since the The Beatles to have the best selling albums of two years (1973 and 1980) in less than a decade.

A film entitled Pink Floyd: The Wall was released in 1982, incorporating essentially all of the music from the album. The film, written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker, starred The Boomtown Rats founder Bob Geldof and featured striking animation by noted British artist and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe. It grossed over $14 million at the North American box office. A song which first appeared in the movie, “When the Tigers Broke Free”, was released as a single on a limited basis. This song was finally made widely available on the compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd and the re-release of The Final Cut. Also in the film is the song “What Shall We Do Now?”, which was cut out of the original album due to the time constraints of vinyl records. The only song from the album not used was “Hey You”, but a sequence was filmed using the song and it only exists as raw footage with poor visual quality but very good audio quality. It was released for the first time as a bonus with the extras section of the 1999 DVD release as a deleted scene.

1983 saw the release of The Final Cut, dedicated to Roger Waters’s father, Eric Fletcher Waters. Even darker in tone than The Wall, this album re-examined many previous themes, while also addressing then-current events, including Waters’s anger at Britain’s participation in the Falklands War, the blame for which he laid squarely at the feet of political leaders (“The Fletcher Memorial Home”). It concludes with a cynical and frightening glimpse at the possibility of nuclear war (“Two Suns in the Sunset”). Michael Kamen and Andy Bown contributed keyboard work in lieu of Richard Wright’s departure, which had not been formally announced before the album’s release. Though technically a Pink Floyd album, the LP’s front cover displayed no words, only the back cover reading: “The Final Cut - A requiem for the post war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd: Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason”. Roger Waters received the sole songwriting credit for the entire record, which became a prototype in sound and form for later Waters solo projects. Waters has since said that he offered to release the record as a solo album, but the rest of the band rejected this idea. However, in his book Inside Out, drummer Nick Mason says that no such discussions ever took place. Gilmour reportedly asked Waters to hold back the release of the album so that he could write enough material to contribute, but this request was refused. The music’s tone is largely similar to The Wall’s but somewhat quieter and softer, resembling songs like “Nobody Home” more than “Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)”. It is also more repetitive, with certain leitmotifs cropping up continually. Only moderately successful with fans by Floyd’s standards (UK #1, U.S. #6), but reasonably well-received by critics, the album yielded one minor radio hit, “Not Now John”, the only hard rock song on the album (and the only one partially sung by Gilmour). The arguments between Waters and Gilmour at this stage are rumored to be so bad that they were supposedly never seen in the recording studio simultaneously, and Gilmour’s co-producer credit was dropped from the album sleeve (though he received attendant royalties). There was no tour for the album, although parts of it were performed live by Waters on his subsequent solo jaunts.

After The Final Cut was released, the band members went their separate ways and spent time working on individual projects. Gilmour was the first to complete his solo album, releasing About Face in March 1984. Wright joined forces with Dave Harris of Fashion to form Zee, which released the experimental album Identity a month after Gilmour’s project. In May 1984, Waters released The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a concept album once proposed as a Pink Floyd project. A year after his band mates’ projects, Mason released the album Profiles, a collaboration with Rick Fenn of 10cc which featured guest appearances by Gilmour and UFO keyboardist Danny Peyronel.

Waters announced in December of 1985 that he was departing Pink Floyd, describing the band as “a spent force creatively”, but in 1986 Gilmour and Mason began recording a new Pink Floyd album. At the same time, Roger Waters was working on his second solo album, entitled Radio K.A.O.S.. A bitter legal dispute ensued with Waters claiming that the name “Pink Floyd” should have been put to rest, but Gilmour and Mason upheld their conviction that they had the legal right to continue as “Pink Floyd.” The suit was eventually settled out of court.

After considering and rejecting many other titles, the new album was released as A Momentary Lapse of Reason (UK #3, U.S. #3). Without Waters, who had been the band’s dominant songwriter for over a decade and a half, the band sought the help of outside writers. As Pink Floyd had never done this before (except for the orchestral contributions of Geesin and Ezrin), this move received much criticism. Ezrin, who had by now renewed his friendship with Gilmour, served as co-producer as well as being one of these writers. Rick Wright also returned, at first as a salaried employee during the final recording sessions, and then officially rejoining the band after the subsequent tour.

Gilmour later admitted that Mason had hardly played on the album. Because of Mason and Wright’s limited contributions, some critics say that A Momentary Lapse of Reason should really be regarded as a Gilmour solo effort, in much the same way that The Final Cut might be regarded as a Waters album.

A year later, the band released a double live album and a concert video taken from its 1988 Long Island shows, entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder, and later recorded some instrumentals for a classic-car racing film La Carrera Panamericana, set in Mexico and featuring Gilmour and Mason as participating drivers. During the race Gilmour and manager Steve O’Rourke (acting as his map-reader) crashed. O’Rourke suffered a broken leg, but Gilmour walked away with just some bruises. The instrumentals are notable for including the first Floyd material co-written by Wright since 1975, as well as the only Floyd material co-written by Mason since Dark Side of the Moon.

1992 saw the box set release of Shine On. The 9 disc set included re-releases of the studio albums A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. A bonus disc entitled The Pink Floyd Early Singles was also included. The set’s packaging featured a case allowing the albums to stand vertically together, with the side-by-side spines displaying an image of the Dark Side of the Moon cover. The circular text of each CD includes the almost illegible words “The Big Bong Theory”.

The band’s next recording was the 1994 release The Division Bell, which was much more of a group effort than Momentary Lapse had been, with Wright now reinstated as a full and contributing band member and figuring prominently in the writing credits. The album was received more favorably by critics and fans alike than Lapse had been, but was still heavily criticized as tired and formulaic. It was the second Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and U.S. charts. The Division Bell was another concept album, in some ways representing Gilmour’s take on the same themes Waters had tackled with The Wall. The title was suggested to Gilmour by his friend Douglas Adams. Many of the lyrics were co-written by Polly Samson, Gilmour’s girlfriend at the time, whom he married shortly after the album’s release. Besides Samson, the album featured most of the musicians who had joined the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, as well as saxophonist Dick Parry, a contributor to the mid-70s Floyd albums. Anthony Moore, who had co-written the lyrics for several songs on the previous album, penned the lyrics for a tune by Wright, “Wearing the Inside Out”, Wright’s first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd record since Dark Side of The Moon. Wright and Moore’s writing collaboration continued on nearly every song on Wright’s subsequent solo album, Broken China.

At the end of the tour in support of The Division Bell in1994, Gilmour stopped planning new music and tours for Pink Floyd, and the band went inactive.

The band released a live album entitled P*U*L*S*E in 1995. It hit #1 in U.S. and featured songs recorded during The Division Bell tour, primarily from concerts in London's Earls Court. The Division Bell concerts featured a mix of classic and modern Pink Floyd. The Pulse album has an entire performance of Dark Side of the Moon. VHS and Laserdisc versions of the concert at London's Earls Court 20 October 1994, were also released. A DVD edition was released on 10 July 2006 and quickly topped the charts. The original edition's CD case had an LED, timer IC, and battery which caused a red flash to blink once per second, like a heartbeat.

In 1995, the band received their first and only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for ""Marooned"".

On 17 January 1996, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman Billy Corgan. Roger Waters did not attend, still being antagonistic towards his former bandmates. At their acceptance speech, Gilmour - referring to the final verse of Dark Side of the Moon - said, ""I'll have to grab a couple more of these for our two band members that started playing different tunes; Roger and Syd..."". Although Mason was present to accept the award, he did not join Gilmour and Wright (and Billy Corgan) for their acoustic performance of 'Wish You Were Here'.

1996 saw the release of Richard Wright's second solo album, Broken China, where he collaborated again with lyricist Anthony Moore.

A live recording of The Wall was released in 2000, compiled from the 1980–1981 London concerts, entitled Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81. It reached #19 on the American album chart. In 2001, a remastered two-disc set of the band's best-known tracks entitled Echoes was released. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright all collaborated on the editing, sequencing, and song selection of the included tracks. Minor controversy was caused due to the songs seguing into one another non-chronologically, presenting the material out of the context of the original albums. Some of the tracks, such as ""Echoes"", ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"", ""Marooned"", and ""High Hopes"" have had substantial sections removed from them. The album reached #2 on the UK and U.S. charts.

In 2003, an SACD reissue of Dark Side of the Moon was released with new artwork on the front cover. The album was also re-released as an 180 gram, virgin vinyl pressing in 2003, which included all the original album art from the original release of the album, albeit with a new poster. Nick Mason's book, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd was published in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the U.S. Long-time Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited at his funeral and performed ""Fat Old Sun"" and ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" in Chichester Cathedral in tribute.

Two years later, on 2 July 2005, the band reunited for a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. This time, however, they were joined by Waters — the first time all four band members were on stage together in 24 years. The band performed a four-song set consisting of ""Speak To Me/Breathe (Breathe In The Air)"", ""Money"", ""Wish You Were Here"", and ""Comfortably Numb"", with both Gilmour and Waters sharing lead vocals. At the end of their performance Gilmour said ""thank you very much, good night"" and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous images of Live 8.

In the week after Live 8, there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd. According to record store chain HMV, sales of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd went up, in the following week, by 1343%, while Amazon.com reported increases in sales of The Wall at 3600%, Wish You Were Here at 2000%, The Dark Side of the Moon at 1400% and Animals at 1000%. David Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, and urged all the other artists and record companies profiting from Live 8 to do the same. On 16 November 2005 Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. Gilmour and Mason attended in person, explaining that Wright was in hospital following eye surgery, and Waters appeared on a video screen, from Rome.

David Gilmour released his third solo record, On an Island, on 6 March 2006, and began a tour of small concert venues in Europe, Canada and the U.S. with a band including Richard Wright and other musicians from the post-Waters Pink Floyd tours. Roger Waters was also invited to join the band (along with Nick Mason) in London, but final rehearsals for his 2006 Europe/U.S. tour required him to decline. Nonetheless, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason's encore performances of ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""Comfortably Numb"" marked the first performance by Pink Floyd since Live 8. Waters was joined on stage by Mason for a few performances of Dark Side of the Moon during his 2006 tour. Wright was also invited to join Waters for the first performance, but Wright refused on the grounds that he had to work on his solo album (which remains unreleased). Waters' worldwide The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour consisted of Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety along with a selection of other Pink Floyd material and a small number of songs from Waters' solo career, although no songs from The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking or Radio K.A.O.S. were included. Waters is reported to be working on a solo album, and there has been talk of him doing a Broadway musical version of The Wall, with other Pink Floyd music to be inserted.

Many fans expressed hope that the band's Live 8 appearance would lead to a reunion tour, and a record-breaking US$250 million deal for a world tour was offered, but the band made it clear that they had no such plans. In the weeks after the show, however, the rifts between the members seemed to have mostly healed. Gilmour confirmed that he and Waters are on ""pretty amicable terms"". Waters indicated that he would like to play together again not for a whole tour but for a single event, similar to Live 8.

On 31 January 2006, David Gilmour issued a joint statement on behalf of the group stating that they had no plans to reunite, refuting rumours from several media outlets. Gilmour later stated in an interview with La Repubblica that he is finished with Pink Floyd and wishes to focus on solo projects and his family. He mentions that he agreed to play Live 8 with Waters to support the cause, to make peace with Waters, and knowing he would regret not taking part. However, he states that Pink Floyd would be willing to perform for a concert ""that would support Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts"". Then speaking with Billboard, Gilmour changed his ""finished with Pink Floyd"" sentiment to ""who knows"".

2007 saw the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's signing to EMI and the 40th anniversary of the release of their first three singles ""Arnold Layne"", ""See Emily Play"" and ""Apples and Oranges"" and their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. This was marked by the release of a limited edition set containing mono and stereo mixes of the albums, plus tracks from the singles and other rare recordings.

On 10 May 2007, Roger Waters performed at the Syd Barrett tribute concert at the Barbican Centre in London. This was then followed by a surprise performance by the post-Waters Pink Floyd line-up of David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason of ""Arnold Layne"" to a rapturous applause and standing ovation. As it turned out, it would be the final time this configuration of Pink Floyd would ever perform together.

Hopes of a second reunion concert with the band's classic lineup were dashed when Waters did not perform with the group. Roger Waters took to the stage to screams of ""Pink Floyd!"" to which he responded, ""Later."" Gilmour, Mason, and Wright took to the stage for what would be the final time to screams of ""Roger Waters!"" to which Gilmour politely responded, ""Yeah, he was here too, now the rest of us.""

In a January 2007 interview, Waters suggested he had become more open to a Pink Floyd reunion: “I would have no problem if the rest of them wanted to get together. It wouldn’t even have to be to save the world. It could be just because it would be fun. And people would love it.”

On 25 September 2007, Gilmour stated that a future reunion of Pink Floyd in any form, be it with or without Roger Waters, looked grim, stating that ""I can’t see why I would want to be going back to that old thing. It’s very retrogressive. I want to look forward, and looking back isn’t my joy.""

In December 2007, Pink Floyd released a new CD box set, Oh, By the Way, containing all fourteen studio albums with their newest respective CD remasters, original vinyl artwork plus new artwork from Storm Thorgerson. Mason and Waters had said that they would be happy to do a Pink Floyd tour, but during the BBC1 Special, ""Which One's Pink?,"" when asked about whether the band would reform, Gilmour ambiguously stated either ""Ain't gonna happen"" or ""Anything could happen"". Which of these two phrases were said is debatable. During the same documentary, Wright stated that he ""wouldn't mind playing the Pink Floyd 'music' again,"" but said nothing solid about reuniting with the actual members.

In a May 2008 interview for BBC 6Music, David Gilmour hinted that he would be in favour of another one-off show, but ruled out a full tour: ""Who knows? Who knows the future? I haven't absolutely said 'no' to the possibility but I think that in reality any sort of long-term thing together is not going to happen. We did the one-off thing and that was probably enough for me but we shall see. At my incredibly advantaged age –having achieved this– I've earned the right to sit on my ass for a little while and consider what to do next."" In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to contemporary music. Roger Waters and Nick Mason were present at the ceremony, where they received the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.

Speaking to Associated Press to promote the release of his new live album, David Gilmour revealed that a reunion ""categorically"" won't happen. Gilmour said: ""The [Live 8] rehearsals were less enjoyable. The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that I've done that. I've been there, I've done it.""

On 15 September 2008, Richard Wright died at age 65. He was lauded by his surviving bandmates, Gilmour in particular, for his influence on the overall sound of Pink Floyd.

In April 2009, it was revealed that the band had initiated legal action against EMI, their label for over four decades, for allegedly failing to pay royalties. The dispute is reportedly connected to an ongoing disagreement with Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm who took ownership of EMI in 2007.

On 10 July 2010, Roger Waters and David Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event took place at Kidlington in Oxfordshire, England. The pair played to an audience of approximately 200. The event raised money for Palestinian children in order to give them a better life. Gilmour played this event in 2009, when he performed alongside Kate Moss. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour has agreed to perform ""Comfortably Numb"" at one of Waters' upcoming performances of The Wall.

On 12 October 2010, Gilmour released Metallic Spheres, a collaboration with techno group The Orb

In 2011, Roger Waters embarked on a tour of ""The Wall"". He confirmed that David Gilmour would perform guitar and vocals on ""Comfortably Numb"" at one of the performances. Gilmour appeared at the 12 May 2011 concert at the O2 Arena in London. Gilmour and Nick Mason joined Waters at the end of the show for a performance of ""Outside the Wall""

On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the band's back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including special ""Immersion"" multi-disc multi-format editions. All the albums have been remastered by James Guthrie, the co-producer of The Wall.

Maroon 5,"Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California, United States. The group was formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers while its members were still in high school and originally consisted of Adam Levine (lead vocals, guitar), Jesse Carmichael (guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums). Kara's Flowers signed to Reprise Records and released an album, ""The Fourth World"", in 1997. After a tepid response to the album, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. Dusick and Madden stayed local at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the east coast to attend Five Towns College. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.

In 2001, the band regrouped, with guitarist James Valentine added to the line-up, and pursued a new direction under the name: Maroon 5. At this point, Jesse Carmichael switched to playing the keyboards and this has become his main instrument in the band (although he also plays rhythm guitar to this day). After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with Octone Records and released their debut album, ""Songs About Jane"", in June 2002. The album's lead single ""Harder to Breathe"", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, the band toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's ""1.22.03.Acoustic"" and 2005's ""Live Friday the 13th"". In 2006, Ryan Dusick officially left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band recorded their second album, ""It Won't Be Soon Before Long"" and released it in May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, ""Makes Me Wonder"", became the band's first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100.

On September 21, 2010, the band released their third studio album entitled ""Hands All Over"". It was re-released in 2011 to include the single ""Moves like Jagger"" (featuring Christina Aguilera). While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, ""Moves like Jagger"" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band released their next album, ""Overexposed"", on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were really successful on the charts - for example, the second single from Overexposed, ""One More Night"" (released on June 19, 2012), reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, ""V"", with the very-first line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012. The album debuted at top of the weekly Billboard 200 chart. Since its debut in 2002, the band has sold more than 15 million albums in the United States and over 100 million singles and 27 million albums worldwide. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Adele," Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, (born 5 May 1988), is a Grammy Award-Winning English singer-songwriter from Enfield, North London. Her debut album, 19, was released in January 2008 and entered the UK album chart at #1. The album has since received four-times Platinum certification in the UK and has sold 5,500,000 copies worldwide. The album included the hugely popular song Chasing Pavements. 19 earned Adele two Grammy Awards in February 2009 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. 

Her second album, 21, was released on January 24th 2011 in the UK and propelled Adele to unprecedented mega-stardom. In just eleven months, 21 received fourteen-times Platinum certification in the UK for shipments in excess of 4,500,000 copies, and has sold a further 6,200,000 copies in the US denoting sextuple-Platinum status. As of January 2012, 21 has sold an estimated seventeen million copies worldwide. The album has produced three global chart-topping singles thus far: Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You, and Set Fire to the Rain. 21 won Adele six awards at the 2012 Grammy Awards, among them Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

Adele graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in May 2006, where she was classmates with Leona Lewis. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent. In school, she was more interested in going into A&R, and hoped to launch other people's careers. Four months later, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend who posted it on Myspace where it became very successful and led to a phone call from music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting. Nick Huggett at XL Recordings recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management and in June 2006 Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major attraction for Adele who was a big fan of the English singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL Recordings in September 2006.

Adele's breakthrough song, Hometown Glory, was released in October 2007. Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate's song, My Yvonne, from his debut album. Adele became the first recipient of the BRIT Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. She released her second single Chasing Pavements on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album, 19. Chasing Pavements reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks, finally remaining in the Top 40 14 weeks after its release. The album itself entered the British charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music would name 19 an ""essential"" Blue Eyed Soul recording.

In June 2013, Adele was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to music.

The much-anticipated third studio album ""25"" was released on November 20, 2015 on the label XL. The first single from the album, ""Hello"", was released on Friday, October 23, 2015.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Adele"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Green Day,"Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, drummer Tré Cool and guitarist and backing vocalist Jason White, who became a full member after playing in the band as a session and touring guitarist for 13 years. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992).

Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, Bad Religion, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States.

Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. 21st Century Breakdown was followed up by a trilogy of albums called ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! released in September, November and December 2012 respectively.

They are one of the world's best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 75 million albums and singles worldwide. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design, losing only the first. Also in 2010, Green Day were ranked number 91 in the VH1 list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"".

In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as ""Al Sobrante"". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band.

In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana.

Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tré Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S.

Kerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo ""was the only person we could really talk to and connect with"". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, ""I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward."" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.


Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994, Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs ""Longview"", ""Basket Case"", and ""When I Come Around"", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year.

In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled ""J.A.R."". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said ""In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets."" The singles released from Insomniac were ""Geek Stink Breath"", ""Stuck with Me"", ""Brain Stew/Jaded"", and ""Walking Contradiction"".

Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for ""Walking Contradiction"" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.

After a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second ""clip show"" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER.

The other singles released from Nimrod were ""Nice Guys Finish Last"", ""Hitchin' a Ride"" and ""Redundant"". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled ""The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg"", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 1999, the guitarist Jason White began supporting the band on the concerts as rhythm guitarist.

In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied. Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying ""Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying."" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying ""Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?"" Though it produced the hit ""Minority"" and a smaller hit with ""Warning"", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified platinum.

At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist.

The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including ""Espionage"", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys.

In the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands.

Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of ""I Fought the Law"" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII.



The resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, ""American Idiot"". The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious ""Jesus of Suburbia"". The album depicts the modern American life under the control from an idiot ruler who let people be misinformed by media as well as inserted ""redneck agenda"". It gives different angles on an everyman, modern icons, and leaders on the topic. Released two months before U.S. President George W. Bush was reelected, the album became protest art. American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005.

Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively.

On August 1, 2005 Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands.

On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band.

Green Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!! In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, California.

In an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.

21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.

Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, ""There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.""

In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot. American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled ""When It's Time"". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single ""When It's Time"".

During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography.

During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: ""We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get [the songs] down in some early form."" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song ""Cigarettes and Valentines"". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will ""most likely"" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011.

During the end of 2011, the band played several secret shows (under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs) whose setlists consisted almost entirely of previously unheard songs. Green Day entered the studio and began recording new material in February 2012, later announcing a trilogy of albums titled ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! which would be released in the fall of 2012. The trilogy marked longtime touring guitarist Jason White's induction as the fourth member of the band. That summer Green Day played several festivals and promotional shows including the Rock en Seine festival in France, the Rock am See festival in Germany, and the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom.

¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! were released on September 21, November 9, and December 7, 2012 respectively and were met with generally positive reviews. On January 22, 2013 the band announced that ¡Cuatro!, a documentary about the making of ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré!, would premiere on January 26 in Aspen, Colorado as part of the X Games FILM showcase, and would be released on DVD April 9, 2013. Another documentary was announced called Broadway Idiot which focuses on the creation on the American Idiot musical and Armstrong's run as playing the character of St. Jimmy. On March 10, 2013, Green Day began their 99 Revolutions Tour to support the trilogy. In June, Green Day broke Emirates Stadium attendance record with 60,000 tickets sold, in the United Kingdom. The band played Dookie from start to finish on several dates on their European leg, including during Reading Festival 2013 headline show.

Demolicious, a compilation that album contains alternate versions and demos of songs from ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré! recorded during the studio sessions of these albums, was released on April 19, 2014, for Record Store Day. It also contains a previously unreleased song called ""State of Shock"" and an acoustic version of ""Stay the Night"", from ¡Uno!.

Since 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons.

In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song ""The Saints Are Coming"", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the disaster.

In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil.

Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song ""Working Class Hero"", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 but lost to The White Stripes' ""Icky Thump"". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.

In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010.

The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show ""a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I’ve seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past."" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that ""the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated"".

Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be ""visually striking [and] musically adventurous"", but noted that ""the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development"". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's ""massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season"". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score ""is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative."" He concluded that ""American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers – for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway."" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote ""Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won’t know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits—it's a global knockout."" The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards.

In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that ""[Artists are] basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it."" For Billie Joe Armstrong, ""Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.""

On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce.

On January 23, 2013, it was announced that a documentary showing Armstrong's journey from punk rock to Broadway was to be released. Called Broadway Idiot and showing a lot of behind-the-scenes of the American Idiot musical production, the movie was directed by Doug Hamilton, veteran television journalist for CBS News' 60 Minutes and PBS documentaries such as Nova, Frontline and American Masters. A trailer was released on January 30, 2013. The documentary premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 15, 2013.

The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as ""true punk"". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented:

""So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.""

Armstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying ""Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money – we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'""

On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, lead vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong stopped while performing Basket Case, because he believed their time was being shortened, possibly in order to extend R&B artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled ""1 Minutes Left"", saying ""You're not gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!"". He also told the crowd he was not Justin Bieber and labeled the festival as a ""joke"". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on their behalf stating that ""Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas"" also adding that Armstrong will be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills for anxiety and insomnia. However Mike Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Billie Joe meant by his rant

Bruno Mars,"Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985 in Waikiki, Hawaii), better known by his stage name Bruno Mars, is a Filipino-Puerto Rican American singer-songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist signed to Atlantic Records. He is most well known for his hit Just The Way You Are, which went #1 in 9 countries in 2010. He is also known for singing/co-writing the hooks for the #1 hit Nothin' On You by B.o.B, and Billionaire by Travie McCoy; he also co-wrote the international hits Right Round by Flo Rida and Wavin' Flag by K'naan.

After the success of the songs he featured on, Mars released his debut EP, It’s Better If You Don’t Understand, in May 2010. 

He then released his debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, on October 5th, which features special guest appearances from B.o.B, Cee-Lo Green, and Damian Marley.  The lead single, Just the Way You Are, was released on July 19, 2010.  The second single off the album, Grenade, was released on September 2010 as a promotional single but was eventually shifted to official second single. The It Will Rain Songfacts reports that in 2011 he recorded ""It Will Rain,"" the lead single from the soundtrack to the movie The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1. It was released exclusively on iTunes September 27, 2011.

Bruno Mars was born and raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii by parents Pete and Bernadette ""Bernie"" Hernandez, of Puerto Rican and Filipino descent. Hernandez was one of six children and came from a musical family giving him a diverse mix of reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&B. From a young age, he was impersonating and performing songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations. In 1990, Hernandez was featured in MidWeek as ""Little Elvis"", going on to have a cameo in Honeymoon in Vegas in 1992. ""I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I'm a fan,"" he stated.

In 2010 he said, ""Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments. My uncle's an incredible guitar player, my dad's an incredible percussionist, my brother's a great drummer, he actually plays in our band. I've just been surrounded by it."" He attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School, graduating in 2003 at the age of seventeen, and shortly after moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career.

Before becoming a successful solo artist, Hernandez was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, and Sean Kingston, as well as Flo Rida's international hit ""Right Round"". He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song ""Get Sexy"" and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7. His first musical appearance as a singer was in Far East Movement's second studio album Animal, featured on the track ""3D"". He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on and co-writing B.o.B's ""Nothin' on You"" and Travie McCoy's ""Billionaire""; both songs peaked within the top ten of many charts worldwide. He said of them, ""I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of ""Nothin' on You"", it might've sounded like some '90s R&B."" Following this success, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You Don't Understand, on May 11, 2010. The EP peaked at the ninety-ninth position on the Billboard 200 and produced one single: ""The Other Side"", featuring rappers Cee Lo Green and B.o.B. He performed a medley of ""Nothin' on You"" and ""Airplanes"" with B.o.B and Hayley Williams at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.

He opened for Maroon 5 on the fall leg of the Hands All Over Tour which began on October 6, 2010. Mars also co-headlined with Travie McCoy on a European tour that started on October 18, 2010.

On September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas for possession of cocaine. He claims ""he has never used drugs before"" and his decision was ""foolish"".

He has been nominated for seven 2011 Grammy Awards. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Mars"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Nirvana,"There are several artists named 'Nirvana';

1) Nirvana was an American grunge band. The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and it was part of the Seattle grunge scene of the late 80s, alongside bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. As their popularity rose, alternative rock became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television during the early-to-mid '90s.

In late 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard (1987–1988).The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape.  After losing contact with Burckhard, the pair instead practised with Dale Crover of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988. Their first single, a cover version of ""Love Buzz"", a song by Dutch group 'Shocking Blue', was released in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. Their debut album, 'Bleach', was produced by Jack Endino and released in June 1989. Later that year, the band recorded the 'Blew EP' with producer Steve Fisk.

At the start of the new decade, the band commenced their first recording sessions to the follow-up album with producer Butch Vig, substituted their drummer by Dave Grohl and signed to DGC Records. The result, 'Nevermind', would eventually sell over seven million copies in the United States, and over 30 million worldwide.

In early 1993, Nirvana released ""Puss""/""Oh, the Guilt"", a split single with The Jesus Lizard, on the independent label Touch & Go. Meanwhile, the group chose Steve Albini as the producer to record its third album. 'In Utero' debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart in September the same year. 

As Nirvana's frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the ""spokesman of a generation"", with Nirvana the ""flagship band"" of ""Generation X"", their third studio album 'In Utero' was considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While Nirvana's mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band's dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the Meat Puppets, a band that Cobain had always idolised, performing with them the songs Oh, Me, Plateau and Lake of Fire. It was later released and topped the charts in 1994.

Nirvana's brief run ended with the suicide of Cobain in 1994, but the band's popularity expanded in the years that followed. Eight years after Cobain's death, ""You Know You're Right"", an unfinished demo that the band recorded two months prior to Cobain's death, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold more than fifty million albums worldwide, including more than ten million copies of Nevermind in the US alone. Nirvana remains a consistent presence on radio stations worldwide.

In 2004, the box set ""With the Lights Out"", a collection of radio sessions, home demos, studio demos and outtakes, was released. A year later, ""Sliver: The Best Of The Box"" was released, a compilation of selected ""WTLO"" tracks, but with 3 new tracks including a track from the famous ""Fecal Matter"" demo.

Band members: Kurt Cobain - vocals, guitar (1987–1994), Krist Novoselic - bass (1987–1994) Dave Grohl - drums, vocals (1990–1994)

Prior members:Aaron Burckhard - drums (1987–1988), Dale Crover - drums (1988, 1990),  Dave Foster - drums (1988), Chad Channing - drums (1988–1990), Jason Everman - guitar (1989), Dan Peters - drums (1990)

Touring members: Pat Smear - guitar (1993–1994), Lori Goldston - cello (1993–1994), Melora Creager - cello (1994)

2) Nirvana is a UK-based progressive rock band formed in 1967, primarily active in the late 1960s and early 1970s - and still sporadically active to the present day.

The band was formed in the summer of 1967 in an era when melodic pop/rock music with baroque and chamber arrangements and instrumentation was highly-prized. The band, consisted of two songwriter/performers - Greek-born Alex Spyropoulos and Irish-born Patrick Campbell-Lyons who met in London. They produced a number of singles (notably ""Rainbow Chaser"", ""Pentecost Hotel"", and ""Tiny Goddess"") for the fledgling Island Records label.

The band was signed by Island Records' founder Chris Blackwell in the era when he also signed the bands Traffic and Free. 

In October 1967 the band released its first album - a concept album produced by Blackwell titled The Story of Simon Simopath. The album was probably the first narrative concept album ever released - predating story-driven concept albums such as The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow (December 1968), The Who's Tommy (April 1969) and The Kinks' Arthur (September 1969).

Musically, the group blended myriad musical styles including rock, pop, folk, jazz, Latin rhythms and classical music - primarily augmented by baroque chamber-style arrangements to create a unique entity.

The next year 1968 their follow-up album, All Of Us, featured a similar broad range of musical styles. Their third album To Markos III was released on the Pye label in 1969.

In 1971 the duo amicably separated for a while, with Campbell-Lyons the primary contributor to the next two Nirvana albums, Local Anaesthetic 1971, and Songs Of Love And Praise 1972. Campbell-Lyons subsequently worked as a solo artist and issued further albums: Me And My Friend 1973, Electric Plough 1981, and The Hero I Might Have Been 1983 though these did not enjoy commercial success.

The band reunited in 1985, successfully touring Europe and releasing a compilation album Black Flower 1987 containing some new material. (Black Flower had been the provisional title of their third album.) In the 1990s two further albums were released. Secret Theatre 1994 compiled rare tracks and demos, while Orange And Blue 1996 contained previously unreleased material including a tongue-in-cheek cover of the song ""Lithium"" originally recorded by the American grunge band Nirvana who released its first album in 1989, and who the band had successfully sued over use of the name Nirvana. The undisclosed terms of the settlement has apparently allowed the original Nirvana to continue using its name and issuing new recordings.

In 1999 the band released a three-disc CD anthology titled ""Chemistry"" including several previously-unreleased tracks and some new material.

Top musicians who played on Nirvana sessions include: Lesley Duncan, Herbie Flowers, Billy Bremner (later of Rockpile/Dave Edmunds fame), Luther Grosvenor, Wynder K. Frogg, Clem Cattini and the full lineup of rock band Spooky Tooth.

The group was in the school of baroque-flavored, melodic pop-rock music typified by The Beatles of ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Revolver"", The Beach Boys of Pet Sounds and God Only Knows, the Zombies of Odessey and Oracle and Time Of The Season, the Procol Harum of A Whiter Shade Of Pale, the Moody Blues of Days of Future Passed and Nights In White Satin and The Kinks of Waterloo Sunset. The majority of the tracks on Nirvana's albums fall into that broad genre of contemporary popular music - not easily categorized - but perhaps best described as the baroque or chamber strand of ""progressive rock, soft rock or ""orchestral pop"".

Their first three albums were reissued on CD by Universal in 2003 and received critical acclaim. In 2005 Universal (Japan) reissued Local Anaesthetic and Songs Of Love And Praise.

As of late 2005 the founding members Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons are still sporadically writing and recording.

Metallica,"Metallica is an American metal band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, California, United States when drummer Lars Ulrich posted an advertisement in The Recycler. Metallica’s line-up originally consisted of Ulrich, rhythm guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield, and lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. Mustaine was later fired due to problems with alcoholism and drug addiction - he went on to form the band Megadeth. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett took his place. Metallica has been through several bassists, including Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus crash while the band was on tour), and Jason Newsted. The current bassist is Robert Trujillo, who joined in 2003.

Metallica’s early releases included fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship that placed them as one of the “big four” of the thrash metal sub-genre alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim, with the 1986 release Master of Puppets described as one of the most influential and “heavy” metal albums. The band achieved substantial commercial success with Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience.

In 2000, Metallica was among several artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band’s copyright-protected material for free without the band members’ consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the “steel-sounding” snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording process of St. Anger.

Metallica has released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, twenty-two music videos, and forty-four singles. The band has won nine Grammy Awards, and has had five consecutive albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200, making Metallica the only band ever to do so. The band’s 1991 album, Metallica, has sold over 15 million copies in the United States, and 22 million copies worldwide, which makes it the 25th-highest-selling album in the country. The band has sold an estimated 100 million records worldwide as of the release of their latest album Death Magnetic. As of September 2008, Metallica is the fourth highest-selling music artist since the SoundScan era began tracking sales on May 25, 1991, selling a total of 51,136,000 albums in the United States alone.

Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. Metallica organised a brand new festival. They called it Sonishpere. Several cities in Europe were chosen by the band.

On June 15, 2011, Metallica announced that recording sessions with singer-songwriter Lou Reed had concluded. The album, titled Lulu, was recorded over several months, and resulted in ten songs based on Frank Wedekind's ""Lulu"" plays, Earth Spirit and Pandora's Box. The album was released on October 31, 2011. The recording of the album was problematic at times, with Lars Ulrich later stating Lou Reed challenged him to a ""street fight"". On October 16, 2011, Robert Trujillo confirmed that the band was back in the studio and writing new material, stating, ""The writing process for the new Metallica album has begun. We've been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we're going to be recording during the most of next year.""

Daft Punk,"Daft Punk  is a multi Grammy Award-winning electronic music duo formed in 1994 in Paris, France, and consisting of French musicians Thomas Bangalter (born 3 January 1975) and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (born 8 February 1974). The band is considered one of the most successful electronic music collaborations of all time, both in album sales and in critical acclaim. 

Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 90s house movement in France, along with other artists such as Air, Cassius, and Dimitri From Paris. Daft Punk are credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the French house scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.

The group released four studio albums: Homework (1997), Discovery (2001), Human After All (2005), and Random Access Memories (2013). They also released the soundtrack album TRON: Legacy (2010); the live albums Alive 1997 (2002), Alive 2007 (2007); the compilation Musique Vol. 1 1993–2005 (2006); the remix albums Daft Club (2003), Human After All: Remixes (2006), TRON: Legacy Reconfigured (2011).


Early years (1987–1993)

Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in 1987 on the grounds of the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. 

Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that ""The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it."" A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music ""a bunch of daft punk."" Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found it to be amusing. As the latter stated, ""We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly."" Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.


Homework era (1993–1999)

In 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, ""The New Wave"", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of ""The New Wave"" called ""Alive"".

Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record ""Da Funk"". It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of ""Da Funk"", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax.

""Da Funk"" and ""Alive"" were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno, house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. ""Da Funk"" was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. It was during this period of change in dance music that Daft Punk became largely successful. They combined the aforementioned music styles and elements of rave that were crowd pleasers. The most successful single from Homework was ""Around the World"", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title.

Daft Punk also produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T. - A Story about Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.


Discovery era (1999–2004)

By 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier. 2001's Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album.

It reached #2 in the United Kingdom, and its single ""One More Time"" was a major club hit, creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles ""Digital Love"" and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart, and ""Face to Face"" hit #1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997.

2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.


Human After All era (2004–present)

Starting on September 13 and ending November 9, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were ""Robot Rock"", ""Technologic"", ""Human After All"" and ""The Prime Time of Your Life"". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was ""we believe that Human After All speaks for itself.""

A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on 4 April 2006. It contains new music videos for ""The Prime Time of Your Life"" and ""Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)"". Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes. A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots.

On 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007.

Daft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on 19 November 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed by Olivier Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island. In 2007 Daft Punk also debuted in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine in position 71.

Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles.


Influences

Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Years before producing electronic music as a duo, they were stated to have shared tastes for Elton John, MC5, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and The Stooges. Their mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own independent project, Darlin'. Bangalter expressed that ""It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band.""They drew inspiration from the rock and acid house displayed in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo pointed to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as an influential work, as the record ""put everything together"" in terms of genre.

The liner notes of Homework pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contains a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter expressed that ""In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty - it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too."" When questioned on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, ""before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people."" The Daft Punk track ""Teachers"" on Homework refers to several influences including Romanthony and Todd Edwards. De Homem-Christo stated that ""Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions — the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul — is part of how we sound today.""

Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk in tracks for Discovery. For the album Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single ""Windowlicker"", which was ""neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track"" according to Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of a previous artist. As stated by de Homem-Christo, ""On 'Digital Love' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge,"" which was generated through an in-studio Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, de Homem-Christo clarified that ""we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs.""


Visual components

Daft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured memorable characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555.

Their outward personae have also changed over time. During their Homework years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance. When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Very few photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes.

In their more visible Discovery years, they have appeared as futuristic robots for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. These suits, engineered by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., sport complicated helmets capable of various LED effects and metallic finger gloves. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers through an advertisement for a special presentation of their videos during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Thomas Bangalter once stated, ""We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 a.m. on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots.""

During a video interview shot in Japan, Daft Punk stated that they donned their robot masks to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later admitted that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. ""But then it became exciting from the audiences' point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower."" When asked on whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated ""No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you."" With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of dark leather jumpsuits and simplified versions of the Discovery head gear. The jumpsuits were designed by Hedi Slimane.

During the filming and promotion of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview.

It is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises has added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter stated, ""The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as long as I have, I am used to it.""


Live performances

In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States. In particular, a rare bootlegged video featuring the duo in Wisconsin matches the verified identity of Thomas Bangalter. Less clearly seen, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo is to Bangalter's right and is mostly cut off from the camera. Comparing the artwork packaging of Homework to the video footage, one can verify that the album's liner note photo was taken during this event.

In the fall of 1997 they did their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage instead of creating a more conventional DJ set. As Bangalter stated, ""Everything was synched up — the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to."" 25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk. Also of note is the November 8 performance in Birmingham, UK, from which came the recording of Alive 1997.

At the start of 2006, Daft Punk announced plans for a number of special summer shows. On 29 April Daft Punk performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival where they received a jubilant reception for their first U.S. performance since 1997. Thomas Bangalter had initially been reported as saying that there would be a DVD of their recent live set. He later emphasized his reluctance for such a release, as the duo felt that online amateur videos of their performances were more compelling than anything captured professionally. In an interview with the Miami Herald Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo stated that their November 11 appearance at the Bang Music Festival was their final for 2006 and that Daft Punk would conduct more performances in the future. The band later specified a date for a live show at Bercy, Paris for June 2007. Also reported were dates at the Rock Ness Festival and Wireless Festival in June, the Oxegen festival in July and Lollapalooza in August. Daft Punk then announced a world tour called Alive 2007.

Daft Punk played at the Rock Ness Festival by the banks of Loch Ness, Scotland on 10 June 2007 as the headline act in the 10,000 capacity Clash tent. To the crowds displeasure, the show was delayed, but the crowd gave the duo a jubilant welcome when they appeared. Due to popularity, part of the tent was removed to allow thousands of people outside to see the show. On 16 June 2007 Daft Punk successfully headlined the third day of the O2 Wireless Festival to positive reaction and reviews. The Times described the set as a ""memorable sensory spectacle, both dazzling and deafening"" and ThisisLondon declared it ""an almost faultless set of relentless electro euphoria"".

Daft Punk headlined Stage 2/NME Stage at the Oxegen music festival on 8 July 2007. Their live set was preceded by a showing of the trailer for the film Daft Punk's Electroma. Subsequent reports stated that the Daft Punk appearance was the highlight of the festival. NME expressed that the performance was ""a robotic spectacular"", while Shoutmouth described the set as ""typically triumphant"". Four days later, the duo played at Traffic Torino Free Festival in Parco della Pellerina in Turin, Italy.

Daft Punk headlined the AT&T stage on 3 August 2007, the first night of the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago. Their show there was praised by Pitchfork Media stating that the experience of watching the performance ""was a much-needed reminder of the still-potent power of communicative pop."" On August 9 they performed at KeySpan Park in Brooklyn, New York.

Daft Punk composed the music for the Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2008 Womenswear Full Show on 7 October 2007. The duo also headlined the Vegoose festival in Las Vegas on 27 October. They appeared at the festival along with bands Rage Against the Machine, Muse and Queens of the Stone Age. At the end of the month, Daft Punk performed in Mexico City. The duo also performed on Friday November 2, 2007 at the Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.

Modular announced that Daft Punk would appear in Australia for an event in December 2007 called Never Ever Land. The announcement addressed years of speculation on whether Daft Punk would visit Australia for live performances. Never Ever Land included Australian acts The Presets, Cut Copy, Muscles, Van She and the Bang Gang Deejays. Daft Punk were supported by their regular acts SebastiAn and Kavinsky at the appearances, which had been announced as an extension to the Alive 2007 tour. Never Ever Land toured to Melbourne at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Perth at the Esplanade, Brisbane at the Riverstage and finally Sydney at the Sydney Showground Main Arena. A Triple J interview with Pedro Winter (Busy P) revealed that Daft Punk's Sydney appearance on December 22 would be their final show for 2007 and the last to feature the pyramid light scheme. Tickets for the Australian tour sold more quickly than for any Daft Punk-related event in their history. The duo stated in an EMI-sponsored live webchat that there will be no tour performances for 2008, and that they would instead focus on new projects.

Daft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008. The duo appeared with Kanye West to perform a reworked version of ""Stronger"" on stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. For the appearance, Daft Punk utilized four JazzMutant Lemur controllers. A press release specified that this was the first televised live performance by the duo in their career. Bangalter's wife, Élodie Bouchez, also attended the event.

Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. In 2008, Daft Punk placed 38th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after debuting at position 71 in the year before. On 8 February 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"".


Daft Punk in DJ Hero
Daft Punk provided eleven new mixes featuring their music for the video game DJ Hero. They also appear in the game as playable characters, along with their own venue. The duo appear wearing their Discovery-era helmets and Human After All-era leather attire. Daft Punk's playable likenesses are absent from the sequel DJ Hero 2, which includes a remixed version of their song ""Human After All"".

At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the duo composed 24 tracks for the film Tron: Legacy. Daft Punk's score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. The band collaborated with him for two years on the score, from pre-production to completion. The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London. Joseph Kosinski, director of the film, referred to the score as being a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements.

Daft Punk also make a cameo appearance as disc jockey programs wearing their trademark robot masks within the film's virtual world. Tron: Legacy co-star Olivia Wilde stated that the duo may be involved with future promotional events related to the film. A teaser trailer features Daft Punk and their track ""Derezzed"" from Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack album of the film was released on 6 December 2010. A deluxe 2-disc edition of the album was also released that includes a poster of the duo from the film. Additional bonus tracks are also available through various online vendors. An official music video for ""Derezzed"", with a running time of less than two minutes, also premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released. The video, which features Olivia Wilde as Quorra in specially shot footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn's Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album of the score titled Tron: Legacy Reconfigured on 5 April 2011.

In 2010 Daft Punk were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight). Soma Records released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track called ""Drive"" that was made during the same time the duo was still with Soma Records and recording ""Rollin' and Scratchin'"" and ""Da Funk"". The track was included in a 20th anniversary multi-artist compilation of the Soma label. In October 2011, Daft Punk placed 28th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after appearing at position 44 in the year before. On 19 January 2012, Daft Punk ranked No. 2 on Mixmag's Greatest Dance Acts of All Time, with The Prodigy at No. 1 by just a few points.

In October 2012, Daft Punk provided a fifteen-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane's Yves Saint Laurent fashion show.[40] The duo also placed 44th in DJ Magazine's annual Top 100 DJs list.

Daft Punk is currently working on their forthcoming album in collaboration with singer-songwriter Paul Williams and Chic frontman Nile Rodgers. Williams mentioned the collaboration in two separate interviews, and that the project has been in production since 2010. During an interview with Rodgers, he stated that he would meet with Daft Punk to discuss the duo's upcoming album. Rodgers later said that he and Daft Punk had an informal jam session when they met, and that a formal collaboration would be undertaken. Although Williams stated that Daft Punk's new album could be released as early as June 2012, it was later confirmed that this would not be the case.

In May 2012 it was announced that Giorgio Moroder had collaborated with the duo, recording a monologue about his life in a vocal booth containing microphones ranging from the 1960s to present day. When asked, the engineer responded that each mic was used to represent the different decades of Moroder's life in his monologue. Rodgers was also present during the recording session. Chilly Gonzales stated in an interview that he had performed material for the duo's project in a one-day session: ""I played for hours and they’re gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever."" He also said that the album would be released ""next spring"".

In an interview conducted on 28 November 2012 with Fourplay member Nathan East, he said to have collaborated with the duo on the project. In this interview, it is also implied that the album will be available in CD format. On 4 January 2013, Nile Rodgers talked about his number of collaborations to be released in 2013 on his blog, and also stated ""The next time [he sets] foot in Japan, [his] collaboration with Daft Punk would have started to hit people's eardrums"".

Lana Del Rey,"Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Grant (born 21 June 1986), better known as Lana Del Rey, is a singer-songwriter from Lake Placid, New York, United States.  Del Rey is known for embellishing her songs and music videos with an eerily nostalgic vibe heavy on Americana themes, including images of surfing, Coney Island, Frank Sinatra, and Marilyn Monroe.  She has also listed a large number of her artistic influences, including Allen Ginsberg, Elvis Presley, Britney Spears, Nina Simone, Nirvana, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys, Antony and the Johnsons, actor and filmmaker John Waters, artists Mark Ryden and Marilyn Minter, and photographers Juergen Teller and Philip-Lorca diCorcia.

Grant released her first professionally produced body of work in 2010, an EP entitled Kill Kill, as Lizzy Grant via Five Points Records with producer David Kahne.  It was available for purchase on iTunes for a brief period before being withdrawn for unknown reasons.  Soon after, Del Rey released a self-titled collection of songs, Lana Del Rey, for electronic download.

In June 2011, Del Rey was signed with Stranger Records and issued the “Video Games” single, and in October 2011 she signed with Interscope Records.  Her next album, Born to Die, is set to be released worldwide on 31 January 2012 under Interscope.  The second single and title track, ""Born to Die,"" is set for release on 22 January 2012. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Muse,"Muse are an alternative rock band from Teignmouth, England, United Kingdom. The band consists of Matthew Bellamy on lead vocals, piano, keyboard and guitar, Chris Wolstenholme on backing vocals and bass guitar, and Dominic Howard on drums and percussion.  

They have been friends since their formation in early 1994 and changed band names a number of times (such as Gothic Plague, Fixed Penalty, and Rocket Baby Dolls) before adopting the name Muse. Since the release of their fourth album, Morgan Nicholls has also appeared with the band at live performances to provide keyboards, samples/synth, and backing vocals.

Their sound is a blend of alternative rock, classical music, electronica, metal, spanish guitars, and progressive rock. Usually they use the bass line as the driving force, often with the guitar providing only an extra layer to the song rather than carrying the melody, the bass has distortion and other effects applied to it to achieve a greater weight, allowing the guitar to digress from the main tune and play higher notes. Another peculiarity is Muse´s piano style in many of their songs; their music has been inspired by the works of Romantic pianist-composers such as Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky and Liszt, and has thus resulted in a fusion of Romantic style with modern rock.

The band are known for their energetic live performances and front man Matthew Bellamy's eccentric and avid interests in global conspiracy, extraterrestrial life, theology and the apocalypse (as much as in Space and theoretical physics). Their lyrical themes involve madcap conspiracy theory, revolutionary rabble-rousing, weird stuff about aliens (or Zetas, if you please), religions and other such classic Muse concerns. In general their music and lyrics gaze on helplessly at the subjugation of humanity by corrupt world leaders and encroaching environmental or galactic disasters (and certainly their fourth album 'Black Holes And Revelations' has its fair share of climate change/oil crisis/global inflagration paranoia). 

In October 1999, Muse released their first full length LP; 'Showbiz'. The album received mixed reviews among critics, and music fans, labeling the band as 'Radiohead copycats'. This, however, did not stop the album from selling over 700,000 copies, with success coming from singles; Unintended and Muscle Museum. The album also earned Muse a nomination at the 2000 BRIT Awards, for Best New Act.

2001, with John Leckie behind the desk again, saw the release of Origin of Symmetry along with Top 20 entries for Plug in Baby and New Born. The album went unreleased in the United States until 2005 because their record label at the time, Madonna's Maverick, allegedly thought the falsetto vocals would discourage radio play and wanted the band to re-record alternate vocals.  The band refused, and terminated its contract with Maverick.

Muse followed up with a b-side/live CD/DVD named Hullabaloo Soundtrack, showcasing the band's concert from France in late 2001. To promote the album, Muse also released the Dead Star/In Your World EP, which charted high in the UK charts and proving Muse could also write ""radio-friendly"" rock tunes, as well as the 7 minute long epics on Origin of Symmetry. Muse polished off their impressive year by winning Best Live Band at the 2002 Kerrang! Awards.

In 2003, Muse asked Rich Costey to step behind the desk to help create Absolution. The album had very strong sales all over the world, and helped the band achieve their first UK number 1 album. Its release was preceded by a download-only single and online video for the song Stockholm Syndrome. Followed by the singles Time is Running Out and Hysteria, which charted well in the UK charts and helped Muse secure a headline spot at the 2004 Glastonbury Festival.

Glastonbury saw Muse storm troop onto the high table of classic Glastonbury headline acts and prove themselves a formidable force in British rock.  Although many had their doubts at putting Muse on the bill with names such as Paul McCartney, Muse proved them all wrong and played what Bellamy described as ""the best gig of our lives."" It was only with that triumph fresh in their throats, they claim, that they realised they'd 'made it'.  However tragedy struck just shortly after Muse came off stage when Dom Howard's father (a big Muse fan) collapsed after witnessing his son play and died on the site.

Later that year, Muse toured the US, promoting Absolution, before returning home to play two sell-out gigs at London's Earls Court at the end of the year.

In 2006 and after a long and exhaustive tour, the band returned to the studio, and released Black Holes and Revelations.Interview with Dominic 2006

With the LP, the band secured their second UK album chart number one, whilst reaching the top spot in several other countries, as well as a Top 10 in the US billboard chart. The controversial single Supermassive Black Hole became Muse's highest UK entry in the charts, reaching number four, and also scored high entries in other countries. The album's second single, Starlight, reached number 13 in the UK charts in September 2006. The 3rd UK single was fan-favourite Knights of Cydonia, released on November 27th, and it reached number 10 in the UK charts. The 4th single from Black Holes & Revelations was Invincible, and was released April 15th 2007. It entered the UK singles chart at 21st place, and was the first single from the new album not to enter in the Top 20. On November 2, 2006, the band won an award for Best Alternative Act at the annual MTV EMA in Copenhagen. Muse were also named 'Best Live Act' at the Brit Awards in 2006 and have retained the title in 2007.

Two of the album's singles reached the highest US Modern Rock chart positions in the band's career during 2007: Starlight reached #2 in February 2007, and the all-falsetto Supermassive Black Hole reached #6 in October.  2007 also saw the band play to sellouts at Madison Square Garden and the Forum in Los Angeles, as well as headlining Austin City Limits Festival and Lollapalooza.

Even when the band says they do not see themselves as a massive stadium band, their headline concert on June 16th 2007, at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, sold out in 45 minutes six months before the gig and the band had to add a second show on June 17, where they proved to be more than worthy of stadium gigs.  The Wembley gigs became two of the biggest hyped concerts of 2007.  Already the gigs have been compared by music journalists to Live Aid and Queen gigs, also performed on the ""Hallowed Ground.""  The band's next release, HAARP: Live from Wembley, is expected to be made up of footage from the June 17th show.

In July 2007, Bellamy confirmed that he had begun to work on a new studio album and new songs, some more in line with electronic or ""dance"" music and others more with classical or symphonic music. 

In January 2008 the song ""Knights of Cydonia"" was voted number 1 on the Triple J Hottest 100, Australia's biggest annual alternative music countdown.

In 2009, the band released The Resistance, which contained the successful single ""Uprising"", the band's first Top 40 pop hit in the United States (achieving this with very little radio airplay) and their first #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart. Followup singles ""Resistance"" and ""Undisclosed Desires"" also proved successful. 

The band's sixth album, The 2nd Law, was released on 1 October 2012. The album's first single, ""Survival"", is the official song of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The second single, ""Madness"" was released on 20 August 2012. The third single, ""Follow Me"" was released on 7 December 2012, with an accompanying lyrics video released on the band's YouTube channel on 1 November 2012. The album has recieved generally positive reviews, with Allmusic noting ""their excursions into dubstep and dance music on tracks like ""Madness"" and ""Follow Me"" feel more like remixes than original songs.""

Their latest album Drones was released on June 5 2015 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Muse"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Bob Dylan,"Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, United States) is an American musician, poet and artist whose position in popular culture is unique.

Dylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962. 

Much of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by Joan Baez. Some of his songs, such as ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with Joan Baez and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the and civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.

His album Bringing It All Back Home marked a move away from the folk scene and a move towards rock and roll and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. Bringing It All Back Home was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.

The second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song ""Like a Rolling Stone"", released in July of 1965, later being named ""The Greatest Song of All Time"" by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan's backing band The Hawks (who would later call themselves simply The Band). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work. On returning to New York he crashed his motorbike, sustaining serious injuries in the process, and went into a period of withdrawal while he recuperated. During the late 1960s, Dylan again changed stylistic tradition, moving away from the psychedelic culture of the time. It was then that he recorded The Times They Are A-Changin', perhaps more famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix.

The 1970s were a period during which Dylan was more sporadic in his output, releasing some poorly received LPs. He rarely appeared in person until 1973, when he began touring again with his backing band The Band. He also wrote one of his most extensively covered songs, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, as well as what is now recognised as one of his best albums Blood On The Tracks. Towards the end of the 1970s, Dylan discovered God, and released some albums of gospel music. He started to talk to the crowd about his faith during his performances, and wouldn't play any of his early work, which alienated some of his previous fans.

Dylan today still remains an influential and popular artist; despite a period of little note between 1970-2000, his 2006 album Modern Times reached the US chart at #1, as did his 2009 album Together Through Life, in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. His 2012 album Tempest was also critically acclaimed. Since 1988, Dylan has been on the so-called Never Ending Tour, during which his performanes have provoked controversy, with some critics claiming that his lyrics have become incomprehensible, an experience which is not helped by his tendency to change his set-list and vocals almost every performance.

Bob Dylan's strong influence over the past few years is becoming even more prominent amongst a growing group of younger emerging artists such as George Ellias and Devendra Banhart. Dylan's early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has shown steadfast devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country/blues to rock and roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway.

Dylan performs with the guitar, keyboard and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s. He has also recently performed alongside other iconic artists, such as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Although his contributions as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.  

Nobel Prize for Literature (2016)  - On October 13, 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”. The prestigious award has been given annually since 1901 and previous Nobel Laureates for Literature include Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett.

The Killers,"There are at least five artists which use, or have used, this name:
1) an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001
2) a Uruguayan rock band from the early 1970s
3) an American hardcore band from Chicago, IL, from the 1990s
4) an American band from Cleveland, Ohio, from the 1980s
5) a British punk rock band from the 1970s
6) An American doo wop group from the 1950s

1. The Killers is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001 and consist of Brandon Flowers (vocals, keyboards), Dave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals), Mark Stoermer (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion). The band's four studio albums to date have sold in excess of 18 million copies worldwide combined. The band got its name from the fictional band ""The Killers"" in the video for New Order's ""Crystal"". The band was on hiatus, but returned to the studio to record their 4th studio album in early 2011. Songfacts reports that ""Runaways"", the first single from ""Battle Born"", was released on July 10, 2012. 
Initially, The Killers played at large clubs in Las Vegas. With the band's line-up stable and their repertoire of songs expanding, the band began to attract attention from talent bookers, local agents, major label, scouts — and a UK representative for Warner Bros. Though the Warner Bros representative passed on the band, he took the demo back with him, showing it to a friend who worked at UK (London-based) indie label Lizard King Records (now Marrakesh Records). The Killers then signed in the summer of 2002 to a British label.
They released their debut album ""Hot Fuss"" on June 2004 in the United Kingdom and US (on Island Records). Their first single was ""Somebody Told Me"". The band also had chart success with their singles ""Mr. Brightside,"" which reached the Top 10 in the UK when released, and ""All These Things That I've Done"".
The band started recording its second album, ""Sam's Town"" on February 15, 2006, at The Palms Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas. It was released on October 2006. Lead singer, Brandon Flowers said that Sam's Town is ""one of the best albums of the past 20 years"". Though the album has received a mixed response from critics and fans, it has still remained popular and sold over 4 million copies worldwide.
The first single, ""When You Were Young"" debuted on radio stations in late July 2006. In late August 2006, it was offered as a downloadable track before the album's debut. The single then entered the chart on downloads alone at #5, and the following week on its official release went to #2 in the UK. The video clip of the second single, ""Bones"", was directed by Tim Burton. The third single was ""Read My Mind"". The video was filmed in Tokyo, Japan. The last one was ""For Reasons Unknown"" released in June, 2007.
The album sold over 700,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, with a No. 2 debut on the United World chart. Brandon Flowers announced on August 22, 2007, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, at the T Vital Festival, that it would be the last time that the album ""Sam's Town"" would be played in Europe. The Killers played their last Sam's Town concert in Melbourne, Australia on November, 2007.
Much of The Killers' music is based on British influences and on the music of the 1980s, particularly New Wave. Flowers has also said in interviews that the larger-than-life sound of many of the band's songs is due to the influence of living in Las Vegas, a city where everything is about flash and who can top whom. They appreciate post-punk bands that sprang up during the 80's such as Joy Division, and they are also avowed fans of New Order (with whom Flowers has performed live), Pet Shop Boys, Dire Straits, David Bowie, The Smiths, Morrissey, Depeche Mode, U2, Queen, Oasis and The Beatles.

""Day and Age"" was the title of The Killers third studio album. The title was confirmed in an NME video interview at Reading and Leeds Festival with lead singer Brandon Flowers. The band headed to the studio in June and the album is being produced by Stuart Price. In the October 2008 edition of German magazine Musikexpress, in an article dated August 15, 2008, Keuning says the new record was 99% finished. The Killers selected Paul Normansell to do the artwork for the new album, which should include some of Normansell's artwork and portraits of the band themselves. 
Flowers also stated in an interview with Q that he was excited to play a new song called ""Tidal Wave"", influenced by David Bowie's ""Drive-In Saturday"" and ""I Drove All Night"" by Roy Orbison. The setlist of The Killers' July 29 and August 1, 2008 show at New York City's Highline Ballroom and Atlantic City's Borgata Hotel and Spa contained two new songs: Spaceman and Neon Tiger. These songs were also played at The Killers' show on July 31st at the MGM Grand at Foxwoods Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut. Spaceman and Neon Tiger are also included on ""Day and Age"". During their brief summer tour in 2008, The Killers confirmed several other potential song titles for ""Day and Age"" including ""Goodnight, Travel Well"", ""Vibration"", ""Joy Ride"", ""I Can't Stay"", ""Losing Touch"", ""Fairytale Dustland"" and ""Human"", although ""Vibration"" wasn't included.

Led Zeppelin,"Led Zeppelin were an English rock band originally formed in 1968 by guitarist Jimmy Page under the name ""The New Yardbirds"", based on Page's previous band, The Yardbirds. The band formed when Jimmy Page (guitar) recruited Robert Plant (vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin), and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven blues-rock sound, Led Zeppelin are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock music. However, the band's individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre. Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of ""album-oriented rock"".

Thirty years after disbanding following Bonham's death in 1980, the band continues to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success, and broad influence. The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They have had all of their original studio albums reach the top ten of the Billboard album chart in the US, with six reaching the number one spot.

Shortly after their first tour, the group's eponymous first album was released on 12th January 1969. Its blend of blues and rock influences with distorted amplification made it one of the pivotal records in the evolution of heavy metal music. Although several of Led Zeppelin's earliest songs were based on or were cover versions of blues standards, others such as ""Communication Breakdown"" had a unique and distinctively heavy sound. Led Zeppelin also featured delicate acoustic guitar on ""Black Mountain Side"" in which the influence of Davy Graham can be heard, and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on the reworked folk song ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"". The immediate success of the first album kick-started the band's career, especially in the United States, where they would frequently tour. 

The second record, simply titled Led Zeppelin II, followed in similar style later that year, and was an even greater success for the group, reaching the number-one chart position in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were blues fanatics; their first album included the Willie Dixon song ""You Shook Me"", and their later hit ""Whole Lotta Love"" was lyrically very similar to an earlier Dixon song. (The band were subsequently accused of using his lyrics without crediting Dixon, and it was not until Chess Records brought suit fifteen years later, that proper credit - and a monetary settlement - was given.) 

The band also loved American rock and roll; the exuberant styles of Fats Domino and Little Richard were inspirations, and Led Zeppelin would perform rockabilly songs originally made famous by Elvis Presley and Eddie Cochran. Onstage, Led Zeppelin concerts could last more than three hours; expanded, improvised live versions of their song repertoire often incorporated tight workouts of James Brown, Stax, and Motown-influenced soul music and funk (favourites of bassist Jones and drummer Bonham).

For the writing of the music on their third album, Led Zeppelin III, the band retired to Bron-yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales. This resulted in a more acoustic sound (and a song ""Bron-yr-Aur Stomp"", misspellt as ""Bron-y-Aur Stomp"" on the album cover) strongly influenced by Celtic and folk music. Led Zeppelin III also ushered in an era of unique album jackets, this one featuring a wheel that displayed various images through cutouts in the main jacket sleeve when rotated. In November 1970 Led Zeppelin's record label, Atlantic Records, released ""Immigrant Song"" as a single against the band's wishes (Atlantic had earlier released an edited version of ""Whole Lotta Love"" which cut the 5:34 song to 3:10). It included their only B-side, ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"". Even though the band saw their albums as indivisible, whole listening experiences - and their manager, Peter Grant, maintained an aggressive pro-album stance - nine other singles were released without their consent. The group also resisted television appearances, which would have reduced their ability to control their presentation and sound quality. Lack of Zeppelin television exposure also enforced the band's preference that their fans hear and see them in person.

Their fourth album, Led Zeppelin IV was actually untitled, but is commonly referred to as Zoso, Runes, The Fourth Album, Sticks, Man with Sticks, or Four Symbols; it featured ""Stairway to Heaven"", which Jimmy Page performed on stage on a custom-built double-necked electric Gibson guitar, the top neck a twelve-stringed version.

Over twenty-five years after disbanding in response to drummer John Bonham's tragic death in 1980, Led Zeppelin continue to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success and influence.

Since they disbanded, Page, Plant, and Jones have only played together on rare occasions. Page and Plant did get back together to record No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded as part of the MTV Unplugged series in 1994, which was accompanied by a worldwide tour, and again in 1998 for the studio album Walking Into Clarksdale. John Paul Jones also has performed since the break up - at the Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester, Tennessee. He was part of a ""SuperJam"" featuring himself on bass, Ben Harper on guitar, and Ahmir ""?uestlove"" Thompson on drums. He also played as a guest during the sets of various other artists throughout the weekend. 

Most recently Led Zeppelin have reformed (with Jason Bonham filling in on drums) for a one-off reunion concert in memory of Atlantic Records co-founder and executive Ahmet Ertegün. After a postponement due to Jimmy Page fracturing one of his fingers, the group performed on 10th December 2007 at the O2 Arena, London. The concert was filmed for a potential DVD release.  Jimmy Page has hinted that the group may start work on new material, and that a world tour may be in the works.

Michael Jackson,"Michael Joseph Jackson (born August 29, 1958 in Gary, Indiana, died June 25, 2009 in Los Angeles, California), often referred to as The King of Pop, is the biggest-selling solo artist of all time, with over 750,000,000 sales. Jackson is an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and double inductee to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. His awards include 8 Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, and 26 Billboard Awards. He is also credited for popularizing many physically complicated dance moves, such as the robot and the moonwalk, and has influenced and spawned a whole generation of a wide variety of artists including Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey and Usher, among others.

Jackson's musical career began in 1967 as lead singer of The Jackson 5, when the group made their first recording with a local label before signing up with Motown Records in 1968. He made his first solo recordings in 1971 while still a member of the group. But it was Off the Wall (1979) which marked the start of his full-fledged solo career, and he formally parted with his siblings in 1984. In his solo career, Jackson recorded and co-produced the best-selling album of all time, Thriller (with worldwide sales over 100 million), received thirteen Grammy awards and charted thirteen #1 singles in the U.S. Throughout his four-decade career, Michael Jackson has been awarded numerous honors, including the World Music Awards Best-selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium. He is also a double-inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997, and in 2001 as a solo artist. He is also a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the mid-1980s, TIME magazine described Jackson as ""the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley"". He has had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world while also tearing down racial barriers and paving the way for modern pop music.

From 1988 to 2005, Jackson lived on his Neverland Ranch property, on which he built an amusement park and private zoo for the enjoyment of economically disadvantaged and terminally ill children. In 1993 and 2003, separate accusations of child molestation that allegedly occurred in Neverland were made against Jackson, which drew intense negative media coverage. While he was never charged for the first case, Jackson was tried and vindicated in 2005 of the latter allegation, but moved out of the US shortly thereafter. He later returned to Las Vegas in early 2007. 

Over the past few years Jackson has made numerous public appearances including MTV Japan's VMA awards where he accepted the legends award; the World Music Awards where he accepted the Diamond Award for selling over 100 million records; James Brown's funeral where he paid tribute and delivered his sermon; and a fan appreciation event in Tokyo, Japan, where he also greeted troops at US Army base Camp Zama. In early 2008, Jackson issued Thriller 25th Anniversary, a critical, and commercial success that is currently the second-biggest selling album of 2008 with over 2.1 million copies sold worldwide.

On June 25, 2009, Jackson collapsed at a rented home in Holmby Hills in Los Angeles, California. The cause of death is currently believed to be cardiac arrest. At the time of his death, Jackson was scheduled to perform 50 sold-out concerts to over one million people, at London's O2 arena, from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. During a publicity press conference, Jackson made suggestions of possible retirement.

In the hours following Jackson's death, his record sales increased dramatically. His seminal album Thriller climbed to number one on the American iTunes music chart, while another eight have made it into the top 40. In the UK, where Jackson would have performed less than three weeks after his death, fifteen of his albums occupied the top 15 spots on the Amazon music chart. Social music network website Last.fm also saw a dramatic increase in Michael Jackson plays per hour after the announcement of his death.

On December 10, 2010, a compilation album of previously unreleased material, simply entitled Michael, was released posthumously. Featuring guest performances by Akon, 50 Cent and Lenny Kravitz, the album was certified Platinum in 18 countries but received mixed reviews from most critics.  This was followed in November 2011 by Immortal, a remix album; in September 2012 by Bad 25, a 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson's 1987 hit album Bad; and by  Xscape, a second compilation album released in May 2014.

Just as the group's lineup has changed, the band's sound has evolved throughout the years, starting off as a post-punk band similar to Wire and Gang of Four before morphing into a gothic rock band in the early 80's, to a synthpop group in the mid-80's and a power-pop-alternative band in the early 90's. The Cure has always been an alternative and very independent band which was evident from the early days. Shunning the anarchistic tendencies of many punk bands after their formation in 1976 , The Cure's first release was Killing an Arab, based on material from French writer Albert Camus' ""L'Etranger"" (translated into English as The Stranger or The Outsider). This track courted controversy because of its theme (misinterpreted as racist, it was in fact, about the futility of killing any ethnicity), but it started to secure a small following, which grew following the release of debut album Three Imaginary Boys and non-LP single Boys Don't Cry in 1979, the latter of which would become one of The Cure's most famous songs.  At that time, The Cure embarked on tour as the support for Siouxsie & the Banshees' Join Hands Tour. After the sudden departure of guitarist John McKay, Robert was recruited as guitarist for the Banshees as the band 'felt he was the only person capable of taking on the task.' As a result, Robert completed the tour playing two sets a night with The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

Following this, The Cure moved from their punk leanings into the portentous post-punk territory, releasing three albums of doom-laden rock in three years, Seventeen Seconds, Faith and Pornography, the latter of which charted inside the UK top 10, though the band were repeatedly dogged by the ""Second-class Joy Division"" tag. Following their third set of line-up changes, the group released Japanese Whispers, a compilation of three singles and their b-sides. Through their desire to escape the Joy Division description, the singles were a poppier effort, featuring danceable tracks like Let's Go To Bed alongside pop songs like Love Cats. Following the commercial disappointment of follow-up album The Top in 1984, The Cure returned to form with 1985's The Head On The Door. Featuring the singles In Between Days and Close To Me, The Head on the Door was distant from the band's punk roots, having more in common with successful alternative bands like The Smiths and Echo & The Bunnymen than their gloomier roots.

Two years later, the eighth studio album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me was a more stadium-sized effort, though featuring audacious pop songs like Why Can't I Be You, it was seemingly caught between two styles. However, it was the band's ninth effort (following the departure of last surviving founder member other than Robert Smith, Lol Tolhurst), Disintegration, that would be their greatest success, both critically and commercially. Disintegration spawned hit singles like Lullaby (no.5 in the UK), Love Song (an impressive no. 2 in the USA), Pictures of You, and Fascination Street. The album itself was a culmination of The Cure's directions through the eighties, featuring the poppier side combined with the more tender aspects, as well as the gloomier facets.

Following this, a remix compilation named Mixed Up was released in 1990, featuring one new track, Never Enough, and two years later tenth studio album Wish surfaced, which was a hit mainly from the momentum gained by Disintegration, though it also featured their most famous pop song, Friday I'm In Love (no.6 in the UK and no.18 in the US). During the years following this, the band became distracted and discouraged by the lawsuit launched by former member Lol Tolhurst, who felt he had been deprived of royalties. As a result, the 1996 album Wild Mood Swings felt unfocused, and was a critical and commercial failure, though the single Mint Car was a moderate hit.

In 1997, The Cure released the compilation Galore, featuring new song Wrong Number. Three years later, at the release of original album Bloodflowers, Robert Smith announced it would be the last album for the band, the album itself being a return to the gloomier rock of Pornography and Faith. Resultantly, another hits compilation was released in 2001. However, in 2004, the band surprised all by returning with a self-titled album, their twelfth studio album, which was a surprise hit, reaching the US Top 10, its lead single - The End of the World  - becoming a modest hit on Modern Rock radio, and receiving a relatively warm reception from the press. 

In May 2005, Smith fired Roger O'Donnell and Perry Bamonte from the band, along with Bamonte's brother Daryl, who had been The Cure's tour manager for many years. The remaining members of the band (Robert Smith, longtime bassist Simon Gallup and Jason Cooper) made a few appearances as a trio before it was announced that founding member Porl Thompson would be returning to The Cure.

In early 2007 the band toured Asia and Oceania, but a planned North American tour in Autumn 2007 was delayed until Spring 2008 so the band could continue recording their next album.

The band released their thirteenth album 4:13 Dream on 27 October 2008. Four singles and a remix EP called ""Hypnagogic States"" were releases on the 13th of each month preceding the album's release.

 In 2009, Robert Smith won the Godlike Genius award at the NME Awards. On April 19, 2009, the band performed at the Coachella Festival in California.

During 2010, Robert Smith contributed songs to the soundtrack of the Tim Burton film ""Alice in Wonderland"" and provided guest vocals on the songs ""Not in Love"" by Crystal Castles and ""Come to Me"" by 65daysofstatic.

Between 31 May 2011 and 1 June 2011, the band performed three concerts at the Sydney Opera House performing the entirety of one of their first three albums on each night. Porl Thompson did not perform with the band at any of the concerts, but Roger O'Donnell performed with the band for the ""Seventeen Seconds"" and ""Faith"" concerts, and co-founding member Lol Tulhurst performed with the band for the first time since 1988 for the ""Faith"" concert. As of 2011, O'Donnell has returned to the lineup officially. In 2012, the band added former Tin Machine guitarist Reeves Gabrels to the lineup. 

In 2013 The Cure started The Great Circle Tour, headlinig festivals in Japn, South Korea and North America. In 2014 Robert Smith announced the upcoming release of a new album, to be called 4:14 Scream, featuring 14 songs recorded during the 4:13 Dream sessions and also an accompanying double album 4:26 Dream containing all the tracks from those sessions.

Gorillaz,"Gorillaz are a British virtual band formed in 1998 by  Damon Albarn of  Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl. They had the idea to create the band while watching MTV in their London flat and originally intended to call the project Gorilla.

The band consists of four fictional band members: 2-D (vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass), Noodle (guitar, vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums). These characters only appear in animated form and are not alter-egos of real people, as is often mistakenly assumed. There is an extensive fictional back-story behind these band members, written by Albarn and Hewlett. Their albums, several of their music videos, and their autobiographical book Rise Of The Ogre all tell the saga. Damon Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor to the band, which is also a collaboration between various musicians. Their style is broad with a large number of alternative influences including rock, hip-hop, and electronica.

They have released four studio albums: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010) and The Fall (Also in 2010). Additionally, they have put out two B-side collections, G-Sides (2001) and D-Sides (2007), and a reggae remix of the Gorillaz album entitled Laika Come Home (2002). The band has also released three DVDs: Phase One: Celebrity Takedown, Demon Days: Live at Manchester Opera House, and Phase Two: Slow Boat To Hades. At the end of 2010, Gorillaz released their next album, The Fall, which was recorded during their US 'Escape to Plastic Beach' tour. It is promoted as being the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website.

The band's first single, Clint Eastwood, was released on 5 March 2001. This single was the first of four from Gorillaz, which was released  on 26 March 2001. The other three singles were released over the next year. These were: 19-2000, Rock the House, and Tomorrow Comes Today. The album sold over 7 million copies worldwide and has gone platinum twice in the United Kingdom earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request. Collaborators on the first album included Del tha Funkee Homosapien (often mistaken as a band-member), Miho Hatori (formerly of Cibo Matto), Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads.and Ibrahim Ferrer. The album was produced by Dan the Automator.

At the end of 2001 the band released another single, 911, which was a collaboration between Gorillaz and rap artists D12, Eminem and Terry Hall. The single was from the soundtrack to the 2002 action comedy Bad Company.

Their second studio album, Demon Days, was released on 11 May  2005 and included the hit singles Feel Good Inc., DARE, Dirty Harry and Kids With Guns / El Mañana. Demon Days went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States, and earned five Grammy award nominations for 2006 and won one of them (Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals). Collaborators on this album (produced by Dj Danger Mouse) include De La Soul, Bootie Brown of The Pharcyde, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Neneh Cherry, Ike Turner, MF Doom, and Roots Manuva, amongst others.

In late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on Carousel, a new Gorillaz project which eventually evolved into the band's third studio album, Plastic Beach, which was released 9 March 2010. Albarn said, ""I'm making this one the most pop record I've ever made in many ways, but with all my experience to try and at least present something that has got depth.” The album features guest performances by Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Gruff Rhys, Mark E. Smith, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon,  Kano, Bashy, De La Soul, Little Dragon, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, sinfonia ViVA, and The Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. 

A 3D projection of the group was shown at the 2005 MTV Music Awards and the 2006 Grammys. They also performed at the Brits, in a different format, using screens rather than projections. Gorillaz have performed live in other occasions as well: in 2001 & 2002 they did tours where the musicians played behind screens, and in 2005 & 2006, Gorillaz had five nights in Manchester and New York respectively. This time the screens were behind the musicians, who were visible to the audience only as silhouettes (except for the guest-stars).

Since the band began to achieve mainstream success, there have been rumours of them working on a full-length movie. Some of these have been confirmed, but nothing has gotten beyond planning stages, mainly due to conflicts between the band and studios involved. In 2008, Hewlett said ""Ultimately we didn't think that feel we're in a position to make the kind of movie we want to make with Gorillaz at the moment. [...] But I'd still like to make a full, lavishly-animated Gorillaz movie someday.""

Albarn and Hewlett created a Pop Opera called Monkey: Journey to the West, which premiered in the summer of 2007 at the Manchester International Festival. A soundtrack album was recorded in the summer as well (initially only digitally available though a CD version was released in 2008). The production went on to show at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris in September-October 2007, the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, SC, USA in May 2008, and the Royal Opera House in London in July 2008.

The duo behind the Pop Opera built on ideas from Monkey: Journey to the West to release a short film in the Summer of 2008 which accompanied the United Kingdom's coverage of the BBC Olympic Coverage in Beijing. It featured a basic outline of the main plot elements of the Opera, reworked into a ""Journey to the East"", with the characters finishing in the Beijing Olympic Stadium. 

Gorillaz headlined the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2010, as an immediate replacement for U2, who dropped out of performing at the festival.

At the end of 2010 Gorillaz released their next album The Fall made in the hotel rooms during their US tour. It is the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website and was available for free download for a limited time.

In April 2012, Albarn told The Guardian that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were ""unlikely"".

Linkin Park,"Linkin Park is an American band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Its following studio album, Meteora, continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth greatest band of the music video era and the third best of the new millennium behind Oasis and Coldplay.

Having adapted the nu metal and rap metal genres to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight, which was released in 2007. The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third best debut week of any album that year. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others included on Reanimation. The band's most recent studio album, A Thousand Suns, was released on September 8, 2010. Linkin Park has sold over 50 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.

Charity:

Oasis,"There are multiple artists who have used the name Oasis:

1. Oasis were an English rock band that formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as The Rain, the group was formed by Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums, percussion), who were soon joined by Liam's older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals).

Its members were signed to independent record label Creation Records and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe in 1994, including hits like Live Forever and Supersonic.

The following year, the band recorded the critically acclaimed (What's the Story) Morning Glory? with their new drummer Alan White that led to international success propelled by singles Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger and Champagne Supernova. In 1997, Oasis released third album and became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, aside Michael Jackson's Bad. McGuigan and Arthurs left the band as they went on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and were replaced by Gem Archer and Andy Bell who joined the group for the recording of Heathen Chemistry.

In August 2009, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from the band. Liam Gallagher initially stated that Oasis were ""done"", but later in February 2010 announced that the remaining members of the band would continue to record music, and did not rule out the possibility of retaining the Oasis name. However, Liam and other former members of the band are instead continuing under the name Beady Eye and Noel has formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.

2. American rock band:  Oasis was an American rock band from Marin County, California active in the 1970s. Their sound has been described as psychedelic folk rock, progressive folk and psychedelic pop, characterized by male/female harmonies. With the help of David Crosby of famed Crosby, Stills & Nash, they recorded one album, Oasis, released on the Cranbus label in 1973.

Members Shelly Fox was previously in Cookin Mama, and Stephen Barncard also worked with Chet Nichols and David Crosby. Kelly Bryan had earlier been in the short-lived Grootna, and later played on a couple of albums by Jesse Colin Young.

Between 1971 and 1978 members of Oasis also recorded under the name RJ Fox and completed an album for Atlantic in 1971 which was never released. A double disc collection of Oasis and RJ Fox material was compiled by the Black Bamboo label in 1998. RJ Fox: Retrospective Dreams included the lost LP, tracks from the Oasis album and many others.

3. American deep house producers: Oasis is a collaboration between Omar-S (Alex O. Smith) and Shadow Ray from Detroit.

4. British classical group: Oasis was a short-lived English classic group active through 1984-1988 featuring Peter Skellern, Julian Lloyd Webber (later replaced by Audrey Riley), Mitch Dalton, Bill Lovelady and Mary Hopkin. Oasis released only self-titled album and two singles and toured till 1988.

Foo Fighters,"Foo Fighters are an American rock band formed by singer/guitarist/drummer Dave Grohl in 1995 in Seattle, USA. Grohl formed the group as a one-man project after the dissolution of his previous band Nirvana in 1994. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters in 1995, Grohl drafted Nate Mendel (bass), William Goldsmith (drums) (both of Sunny Day Real Estate and The Fire Theft), and Pat Smear (guitar) (of The Germs) to complete the group. Goldsmith left during the recording of the group's second album The Colour and the Shape (1997), soon followed by Smear. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl left prior to the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999).

Chris Shiflett joined as the band's second guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album One by One in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and harder-rocking material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace in 2007. Over the course of the band's career, three of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album, and all six have been nominated for Grammys. The band's seventh album Wasting Light was released in 2011 and peaked at #1 in several countries.

Formation and debut album
Dave Grohl joined the band Nirvana as the group's drummer in 1990. In order to occupy himself during tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the band; he said in 1997, ""I was in awe of frontman Kurt Cobain's songs. And intimidated. I thought it was best that I keep my songs to myself."" Instead, Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos, and even issued a cassette of some of those songs called Pocketwatch under the pseudonym ""Late!"" in 1992.

Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, and Nirvana subsequently disbanded. Grohl received offers to work with various artists, and almost accepted a permanent position as the drummer in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered a studio in October 1994 to record twelve of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on ""X-Static"" by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. ""I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life,"" Grohl later said. ""I thought that I would rather do what no-one expected me to do. I enjoy writing music and I enjoy trying to sing, and there's nothing anyone can really do to discourage me."" Grohl completed an album's worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for feedback.

Grohl hoped to keep his anonymity and release the recordings in a limited run under the title ""Foo Fighters"", taken from the World War II term ""foo fighter"", used to refer to unidentified flying objects. According to Rope Songfacts, he was reading a book about military World War II sightings at the time and he wanted people to think it was a band. So he called it Foo Fighters as it was plural. However, the demo tape circulated in the music industry, creating interest among record labels. Grohl formed a band to support the album. Initially, Grohl talked to former Nirvana band mate Krist Novoselic about joining the group, but both decided against it. ""For Krist and I, it would have felt really natural and really great"", Grohl explained. ""But for everyone else, it would have been weird, and it would have left me in a really bad position. Then I really would have been under the microscope."" Having heard about the disbanding of Seattle-based emo band Sunny Day Real Estate, Grohl drafted the group's bass player, Nate Mendel, and drummer, William Goldsmith. Grohl asked Pat Smear, who served touring guitarist for Nirvana after the release of its 1993 album In Utero, to join as the group's second guitarist. Grohl ultimately licensed the album to Capitol Records, releasing it on his new record label, Roswell Records.

The group played its debut show at a keg party in February 1995. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album. Foo Fighters undertook their first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for Mike Watt. The band's first single ""This Is a Call"" was released in June 1995, and its debut album Foo Fighters was released the next month. ""I'll Stick Around"", ""For All The Cows"" and ""Big Me"" were released as subsequent singles. The band spent the following months on tour, including their first appearance at the Reading Festival in England in August.

The Colour and the Shape
After touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered a studio in Woodinville, Washington with producer Gil Norton to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he wasn't happy with how the mixes were turning out, and the band ""basically re-recorded almost everything"". During the L.A. sessions, Grohl played drums on some of the songs. Goldsmith said Grohl did not tell him that he recorded new drum parts for the record and, feeling betrayed, left the band.

In need of a replacement for Goldsmith, Grohl contacted Alanis Morissette's touring drummer Taylor Hawkins to see if he could recommend anybody. Grohl was surprised when Hawkins volunteered his own services as drummer. Hawkins made his debut with the group in time for the release of its second album, The Colour and the Shape, in May 1997. The album spawned the singles ""Monkey Wrench"", ""My Hero"", and ""Everlong"".

Pat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band to pursue other interests. Four months later in September 1997 at the MTV Video Music Awards, Smear simultaneously publicly announced his departure from the band and introduced his replacement, Grohl's former Scream bandmate Franz Stahl. Stahl toured with the band for the next few months, and appeared on two tracks that the band recorded for movie soundtracks, a re-recording of ""Walking After You"" for The X-Files and ""A320"" for Godzilla.

There Is Nothing Left to Lose
In 1998, Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl's home state of Virginia to write music for its third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, ""In those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't"". Grohl was distraught about the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, in Grohl's Virginia home studio. The album spawned several singles, including ""Learn to Fly"", the band's first single to reach the US Hot 100.

Before the release of the album, Capitol president Gary Gersh was forced out of the label. Given Grohl's history with Gersh, Foo Fighters' contract had included a ""key man clause"" that allowed them to leave the label upon Gersh's departure. They subsequently left Capitol and signed to RCA, who later acquired the rights to the band's Capitol albums.
Chris Shiflett joined Foo Fighters as a touring guitarist before becoming a full member

After recording was completed, the band auditioned a number of potential guitarists, and eventually settled on Chris Shiflett, who previously performed with No Use for a Name and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Shiflett initially joined the band as touring guitarist, but achieved full-time status prior to the recording of the group's fourth album.

That same year, Foo Fighters established a relationship with rock band Queen, of whom the band (particularly Grohl and Hawkins) are fans. Guitarist Brian May added a guitar track to Foo Fighters' second cover of Pink Floyd's ""Have a Cigar"", which appeared on the soundtrack to the movie Mission Impossible 2. When Queen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001, Grohl and Hawkins were invited to perform with the band on ""Tie Your Mother Down"", with Grohl filling in on vocals for Freddie Mercury. In 2002, guitarist May contributed guitar work to ""Tired of You"" and an outtake called ""Knucklehead"". The bands have performed together on several occasions since, including VH1 Rock Honors and Foo Fighters' headlining concert in Hyde Park.

One by One
Near the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record their fourth album. After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, Grohl spent some time helping Queens of the Stone Age complete their 2002 album Songs for the Deaf. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, Grohl, inspired by the sessions, decided to reconvene Foo Fighters to rework a few songs on their album. Instead, they re-recorded nearly all of the album (save ""Tired of You"") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's studio in Virginia. The final album was released in October of 2002 under the title One by One. Singles from the album included ""All My Life"", ""Times Like These"", ""Low"", and ""Have It All"". The band later expressed displeasure with the album. Grohl told Rolling Stone in 2005, ""Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it.""

For most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004 prior to donating 3 million dollars to the new Pittsburgh Penguins arena, upon learning that George W. Bush's presidential campaign was using ""Times Like These"" at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to John Kerry's campaign. Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets. The entire band eventually joined Grohl for a performance in Arizona coinciding with one of the presidential debates.

In Your Honor and acoustic tour
Having spent a year and a half touring behind One By One, Grohl did not want to rush into recording another Foo Fighters record. Initially Grohl intended to write acoustic material by himself, but eventually the project involved the entire band. To record its fifth album, the band shifted to Los Angeles and built a recording studio, dubbed Studio 606 West. Grohl insisted that the album be divided into two discs–one full of rock songs, the other featuring acoustic tracks. In Your Honor was released in June 2005. The album's singles included ""Best of You"", ""DOA"", ""Resolve"", ""No Way Back"", and ""Miracle"".

On June 17, 2006, Foo Fighters performed their largest non-festival headlining concert to date at London's Hyde Park. The band was supported by Juliette and the Licks, Angels & Airwaves, Queens of the Stone Age, and Motörhead. Motörhead's Lemmy joined the band on stage to sing ""Shake Your Blood"" from Dave Grohl's Probot album. Also, as a surprise performance, Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen jammed with Foo Fighters, playing part of ""We Will Rock You"" as a lead into ""Tie Your Mother Down"".

In further support of In Your Honor, the band decided to organize a short acoustic tour for the summer of 2006. The tour included former member Pat Smear, who rejoined the band as an extra guitarist, Petra Haden on violin and backup vocals, Drew Hester on percussion, and Rami Jaffee of The Wallflowers on keyboards/piano. While much of the setlist focused on In Your Honor's acoustic half, the band also used the opportunity to play lesser-known songs such as ""Ain't It The Life"", ""Floaty"", and ""See You"". The band also performed ""Marigold"", a Pocketwatch-era song that was best-known as a Nirvana B-side.

In November 2006, the band released their first ever live CD, Skin and Bones, featuring fifteen performances captured over a three-night stand in Los Angeles. An accompanying DVD was released, and featured tracks not available on the CD.

Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace
For the follow-up to In Your Honor, the band decided to call in The Colour and the Shape producer Gil Norton. Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace was released in September 2007. The album's first single, ""The Pretender"", was issued to radio in early August. The second single, ""Long Road to Ruin"", was released in December 2007, supported by a music video directed by longtime collaborator Jesse Peretz (formerly of the Lemonheads).

In mid-to-late 2007 ""The Pretender"" topped the Modern Rock chart for a record 18 weeks, it also gave the band their third consecutive year at the top (a record), and made them the only artist besides Red Hot Chili Peppers to have 4 consecutive albums have songs reach the top (RHCPs have 5). When ""Long Road to Ruin"" reached the top it gave them their fourth consecutive year to have a song reach the top (breaking their own record). When the fourth single, ""Let It Die"", reached the top 20 it gave them 3 songs in the top 20, one of only four artists to do this. ""Let It Die"" is also the album's third Number One hit on the chart.

Not long after completing the recording sessions for the album, the band participated in Live Earth at Wembley Stadium in London, England, performing the penultimate set of the night. Later that summer, the band headlined V Festival 2007, including a surprise acoustic set on the Channel 4 stage under the name 606. In October 2007, Foo Fighters started their world tour in support for Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace. The band performed shows throughout the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada and Asia. The band finished its world tour in September 2008 at the Virgin Festival at Toronto Island Park in Canada.

Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace was nominated for 5 Grammys in 2008. The Foo Fighters went home with Best Rock Album and Best Hard Rock Performance (for ""The Pretender""). The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, while ""The Pretender"" was also nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rock Song.

On 17 September 2008 Dave Grohl announced on The Chris Moyles Show that the band would be taking a long break from music so that they could return with a new sense of purpose, and also informed fans not to expect any new music for a while. ""We've never really taken a long break, I think it's time,"" Grohl commented. ""After doing Wembley, we shouldn't come back there for 10 years because we've played to everybody. We're over in the UK every year, every summer, so I think it's time to take a break and come back over when people really miss us.""

 Wasting Light 

After taking a break from music, Foo Fighters returned in 2011 with the album Wasting Light. The album was recorded in Dave Grohl's garage, as opposed to Studio 606. Grohl addressed by stating ""There's poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a garage."" Wasting Light features many guest musicians, including Krist Novoselic, who had played with Grohl in Nirvana. 

Foo Fighters released a 30 second teaser on January 17th 2011 of the song ""Bridge Burning"", and on February 1st 2011 the announcement of the release date of the album, April 12th 2011, was accompanied by a 30 second teaser of ""Miss the Misery"". On February 12th, the music video for ""White Limo"" was released. And on February 23rd ""Rope"" was released for online streaming. 

On March 1st ""Rope"" was released as the first single from the album. It peaked at number 1 in the US on the Rock, Alternative, and Mainstream Rock charts.

On April 9th the band appeared on Saturday Night Live (host Helen Miren). They played the song ""Rope"" for their first performance, and debuted the song ""Walk"" for their second. 

Wasting Light peaked at number 1 on the Albums chart in 12 countries, including the US and UK. It has achieved platinum status in Australia and New Zeland. 

Musical style
When Grohl first started the band, its music was often compared to that of his previous group, Nirvana. Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, ""Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down."" Foo Fighters also utilize the Pixies' technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud chorus, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana ""liking the Knack, Bay City Rollers, The Beatles, and Abba as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag, I suppose"". Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar similar to how he approached playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, ""I could hear the song in my head before it was finished."" Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.

The members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with harder sounds. Grohl noted in 1997, ""We all love music, whether it's the Beatles or Queen or punk rock. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.""

Campaigning and activism
In 2000, the band generated controversy through their public support of Alive & Well, an organization that denies the link between HIV and AIDS, questions the validity of HIV tests, and advises against taking medication to counter the disease. Foo Fighter bassist Nate Mendel learned of Alive & Well through What If Everything You Thought You Knew about AIDS Was Wrong?, a self-published book written by Christine Maggiore, the organization's founder. Mendel passed the book around to the rest of the band, who supported his advocacy.

In January 2000, the band played a benefit concert for the organization, which Mendel helped to organize. The band also contributed songs to The Other Side of AIDS, a controversial documentary film by Maggiore's husband Robin Scovill, which questions whether HIV is the cause of AIDS. The band's position caused alarm in the medical community, as Alive & Well's advice ran contrary to established medical wisdom about HIV and AIDS. In a 2000 interview, Mendel spoke of using Foo Fighters' popularity to help spread the group's message and of holding more benefits for the organization. However, no further benefits have taken place, and the band has since removed the organization from its list of supported causes. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Imagine Dragons,"Imagine Dragons is a Grammy award-winning alternative rock band which formed in 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The band consists of Dan Reynolds (vocals), Wayne Sermon (guitar), Ben McKee (bass) and Daniel Platzman (drums). The band released four EPs - ""Imagine Dragons"" (2009), ""Hell and Silence"" (2010), ""It's Time"" (2011) and ""Continued Silence"" (2012) - before releasing their debut full length album ""Night Visions"" on 4 September 2012.

The band's single ""It's Time"", which previously appeared on the ""It's Time"" and ""Continued Silence"" EPs in addition to appearing on ""Night Visions"", is the group's biggest hit, reaching #33 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In a dark kitchen in the middle of a sweaty night in Las Vegas, all 6’4” of Dan Reynolds is hunched over a laptop, slapping beats on the table and crooning lyrics into a tiny microphone.  Before long, he and the other three members of indie rock band Imagine Dragons would be playing “It’s Time,” that same laptop-demo-turned-supersized-anthem, from the roof of a parking garage to a wave of thousands of screaming fans.  This song title to the single from their 2012 debut KidInaKorner/Interscope release “Continued Silence EP” is an all too apt descriptor of the band’s hard-earned success—but it’s also emblematic of the deep-seated anxiety Reynolds and the rest of the band experienced leaving behind any realistic expectation of a normal job to do the thing they love most. 

A third-generation Las Vegas native, Reynolds is no stranger to the adage “the house always wins,” choosing to pave his musical career with a near obsessive work ethic and hundreds of unused demos rather than roll the dice with the first songs that sprung from his mouth.  It’s no surprise, then, that he was drawn to guitarist Wayne Sermon, another founding member of Imagine Dragons.  Having practically grown up in a recording studio and graduated Berklee College of Music, Wayne had been practicing his guitar through meals and other socially inappropriate situations as long as he could remember; he challenged Dan in a way that was both uncomfortable and exactly what they both needed.  When they began writing songs together and recognized something special was happening, Wayne called up his Berklee friend Ben McKee, who promptly dropped out of school with only a few credits left, moving across the country to play bass for the band.  This sort of reckless/genius behavior is typical for Ben, who has an uncanny penchant for spicy food and a suitcase full of unbelievable road stories.  More recently, the band was joined by drummer Daniel Platzman, another Bostonian schoolmate who seems way too nice to be playing rock and roll until you actually see him in action.

Several tours and three self-released EPs later, Imagine Dragons had made a serious name for itself, particularly in the west coast circuit.  Although their songs vary from nearly whimsical and light to brooding and powerful, listeners are drawn to the inherent honesty in the music.  The only rule of thumb for the band, it seems, is to write from a true place; the result is songs that literally run the spectrum of human emotion.  Attend a concert, and it becomes clear that the live performance of deeply personal songs has a real effect on people.  And the band itself is not immune, as demonstrated when Dan literally passed out into the drum set during a finale song, sending cymbals and drum stands crashing while the rest of the band played on until the close.

Great songwriting is bound to be noticed eventually.  As proof that the harder you work, the luckier you get, one of those people who noticed was Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid (Eminem, Rihanna).  Alex and Dan began collaborating on projects, and soon the band had developed a relationship with Alex and his team.  The alchemy resulting from Alex’s hip hop sensibilities and Imagine Dragons’ anthemic rock is nothing short of explosive.  The byproduct of this creative collision is “Continued Silence,” a six song in-your-face sonic grenade that breaks musical boundaries and yet is strangely relatable by its improbably diverse audience. 

Despite it all, on any given day when they aren’t on the road playing shows, you can still find Imagine Dragons huddled away in a rehearsal room somewhere, banging out song after song in search of the next perfect track.  Like most things in Vegas, the band is angled at going big or going bust.  For the sake of those who love great music, we hope it’s the former.

Shawn Mendes,"Shawn Mendes (born Shawn Peter Raul Mendes; August 8, 1998 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian singer-songwriter. Since the release of his self-titled The Shawn Mendes EP and his debut single ""Life of the Party"", he has been gaining mainstream success as a singer-songwriter and touring artist.

Mendes was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and was raised in Pickering, a suburb of the city. He is the son of Karen, a real estate agent, and Manuel Mendes, a businessman. His father is of Portuguese descent (from a family from Lagos), while his mother is English. 

He first started posting cover videos on the popular social video app Vine in 2013 and picked up millions of views and followers in a matter of months, becoming well known for his six-second snippets of renditions of many popular songs. Artist manager Andrew Gertler discovered Mendes online in January 2014, bringing him to Island Records where he eventually signed and released his first single ""Life of the Party"" in June 2014. He is the youngest artist to debut in the top 25 with a debut song on the Billboard Hot 100, making to number 24 for the week ending July 12, 2014 at 15 years, 11 months and 4 days of age.

Prior to his signing, Mendes toured as a member of the MagCon Tour  alongside other young artists and social media sensations such as Nash Grier, Cameron Dallas, Jack & Jack, and more. Mendes was also on a nationwide tour with Austin Mahone as an opening act and released his debut major label EP in July, with a debut album due out later in 2014. He won the Teen Choice award in 2014 for Webstar in Music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Shawn+Mendes"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

David Guetta,"David Guetta (born November 7th, 1967 in Paris) is a French DJ.

He was the pioneer of French house with ""Up & Away,"" a garage-style track with vocals by Robert Owens released in 1994 – really made a name for himself in the mid-90s as one of the key catalysts of Parisian nightlife by promoting evenings at such renowned Paris hot spots as Folies Pigalle, Queen, Bataclan, Palace and Les Bains, where he invited DJ legends like Little Louie Vega, David Morales, DJ Pierre and Roger Sanchez to join him on the turntables. In 2001, however, he went back to his first love: making music.

Launched by the single ""Just A Little More Love,"" an electro-funk-house cocktail featuring Chris Willis of the band Nashville on vocals, David Guetta’s first album was released by Virgin in June 2002 and went on to sell 250,000 copies. This resounding success carried through in the album's second, even more devastating single, ""Love Don't Let Me Go,"" a track reminiscent of Moroder's techno-disco style crossed with Depeche Mode's new-wave sound.

Like fellow Frenchman Laurent Garnier, David started off his career in the gay clubs around Paris. Les Halles district in the mid-80s, going on to make a name for himself in acid-house and hip-hop. His first album heralded the beginning of a new DJ career – this time on a global level. Named after the parties he hosts on Ibiza, the fabled isle of techno, David's ""F*** ME I'M FAMOUS: IBIZA DJ MIX"", which featured his remix of David Bowie's ""Heroes,"" went gold: no small feat for a compilation CD. For the last three years, David has been invited to mix throughout Europe on a regular basis and, more and more often, in the United States, Australia, Japan, Singapore and Israel as well. He is also resident DJ at The Cross in London, Barcelona ‘s Discoteca and the Lausanne club Mad.

Propelled by the rock guitars of the single Money, David’s second album, GUETTA BLASTER, is even gutsier. David and Joachim Garraud (the first album’s co-composer and co-producer) applied themselves to creating real songs modeled on electro-pop classics of the 80s by such masters as Depeche Mode, Yazoo, Dead Or Alive, and New Order, to name the most prominent influences. All the tracks on this second album are original compositions. The gospel sounds of Chris Willis and the stylings of guest vocalists JD Davis (lead singer of Sinema), James Perry (alias Jimmy Polo, renowned singer/producer on the Chicago scene) and Britain’s Stereo MCs give the tracks a unique luster, while the production skills of Guetta and Garraud lift the album to new – and always spectacular – heights.

From GUETTA BLASTER’s opening salvos, ""Money and Stay,"" we get beats that are cranked up a notch beyond the hard-dance formula of ""Just A Little More Love."" Without an ounce of hesitation, the album launches itself at the experimental roots of house music and cold-wave, displaying an unexpected stylistic versatility, then oscillates between powerful mixtures of hot & cold and black & white. The result is 100% addictive.

""Used To Be The One,"" with vocals by Willis, owes a debt to both Yazoo’s Don't Go and garage music. Similarly, the counterpoint of Time evokes Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams, blending the best of English pop and dance culture – something David has mastered like no one else. Open Your Eyes, a track tailor-made for the Stereo MCs, is built on a rubbery break beat and an acid sequence, with a rap that brings their classic Connected to mind. The abrasive AC/DC, clearly a future hit on the underground/rave circuit, is like the missing link between Jeff Mills and Ministry of Sound.

Two velvet-smooth cuts neatly crown the album: ""In Love With Myself,"" a track that could hold its own against Moroder & Oakey’s Electric Dreams any day, is followed by ""Higher,"" on which Chris Willis pays homage to the style of phrasing and embellishment popularized by Stevie Wonder, an approach that has proliferated in both R&B and garage/house music à la New Jersey duo Blaze. GUETTA BLASTER drives its point home with the metronomic Movement Girl, featuring James Perry, and the killer Get Up, on which macho riffs, the hysterical falsetto of Chris Willis and screaming guitars swirl around a punchy beat.
On GUETTA BLASTER, David Guetta has not only successfully avoided the pitfalls of second albums – he has truly launched himself into a new dimension.
The song ""Just A Little More Love"" appeared in the film The Football Factory, was sung in the Gospel version at the 2006 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.
On New Year's Day 2007 he appeared at Big Beach Boutique 3, a concert held on the beach of Brighton, UK, put together by and headlined by Fatboy Slim.
His fourth album is ""Pop Life"" released in France on 23 April, 2007 with the leading single
""Love is gone.""

24. August 2009. he released ""One Love"". He introduces this album with the hit singles ""When Love Takes Over"" feat. Kelly Rowland and ""Sexy Bitch/Chick"" feat. Akon. He wanted to make a new music stream named House Pop or Hip House. In this album he worked with well known vocalists, producers and DJs like Chris Willis, Estelle, Kid Cudi, Novel, Ne-Yo, Will I Am & Apl De Ap from The Black Eyed Peas, Lil' John, DJ Chuckie, Abel Ramos, Koen Groenveld, Afrojack, DJ Footloose, Joachim Garraud and others. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Frank Ocean,"Frank Ocean (born October 28, 1987) is an American singer/songwriter and member of the gleefully hedonistic hip-hop collective OFWGKTA. He was born Christopher ""Lonny"" Breaux in New Orleans, Louisiana, and now resides in Beverly Hills. He has helped pen tracks for Justin Bieber, John Legend, Brandy, and Beyonce Knowles over the last few years. In 2011, Ocean released his debut mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra, for free via his Tumblr.

Venting about his decision to drop the record his own way, he took to Twitter on March 1, 2011: ""i. did. this. not ISLAND DEF JAM. that's why you see no label logo on the artwork that I DID. guess its my fault for trusting my dumbass lawyer and signing my career over to a failing company. fuck Def Jam & any company that goes the length of signing a kid with dreams & talent w/ no intention of following through. fuck em. now back to my day. i want some oatmeal and toast. brunch swag.""

As a member of the Odd Future (OFWGKTA)  collective, his sound is distinctively soulful/r&b influenced, yet done in a way that could pass for something totally different. As Tyler, the Creator states, “It’s Smooth Ass Music About Bitches, Relationships And Being A Rich Young Nigga…But In A Swagged Out Way.” 

Ocean was evacuated from the University of New Orleans to Los Angeles, California just as Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005, and stayed in Los Angeles to pursue a music career. Ocean joined Los Angeles based collective OFWGKTA, who he met through mutual friends, at the end of 2009. In the end of 2009, he met Tricky Stewart, who helped Ocean sign a contract with Def Jam Recordings as an artist, however, he was initially unable to build a relationship with the company. In 2010, he changed his name from Christopher ""Lonny"" Breaux to Christopher Francis Ocean via a legal website. In an April 2011 interview, Ocean intimated that his relationship with Def Jam has strengthened since the release of his mixtape. On April 28, 2011, Ocean was arrested on unspecified charges by the LAPD, and was released on the morning after on April 29, 2011. Ocean joined his OFWGKTA bandmates for the first time on tour from May 12 to May 19, 2011. On May 31, 2011, Def Jam released the single Novacane on iTunes soon followed by Swim Good Taken from his mixtape Nostalgia, ULTRA. His first 'proper' album, Channel Orange was released on July 17th, 2012.
In 2016, He released the visual album Endless alongside his second studio album Blonde, following several years of delays. Blonde debuted at number one in the United States and United Kingdom.

M83,"M83 is the rock and electronic music project of the French artist Anthony Gonzalez. He and former member Nicolas Fromageau founded the group in 2001 in Antibes, France. M83's style owes a lot to the shoegaze genre, in that there is much emphasis on tonality, extensive use of reverb effects and often softly-spoken lyrics at times submerged in instrumentation. M83 was named after the spiral galaxy ""Messier 83"". 

M83 has released the following albums: M83 in 2001, Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts in 2003, Before the Dawn Heals Us in 2005, Digital Shades Vol. 1 in 2007, Saturdays = Youth in 2008, Hurry Up, We're Dreaming in 2011, Oblivion, You and the Night in 2013 and Junk in 2016.

For the third album released by M83, Before the Dawn Heals Us, Gonzalez decided to part from Fromageau (after an emotionally distressing tour for Dead Cities). Currently Anthony Gonzalez records mainly on his own(Nicolas Fromageau started Team Ghost in 2009), often with the help of his brother Yann Gonzalez, vocalist/keyboardist Morgan Kibby, guitarist/bassist Pierre-Marie Maulini, and drummer Loïc Maurin.

M83 produced the remix of the track ""Pioneers"" on the British rock group Bloc Party's 2005 album Silent Alarm Remixed. M83 also collaborated with other Gooom Disques artists in a collaborative LP, under the name Purple Confusion.

Just after the Before the Dawn Heals Us US tour, Anthony Gonzalez decided to take M83 in a more ambient direction (as heard on some earlier M83 tracks) and started to write and record a collection of ambient works. The relevance of digital music (from creation to sharing), gave him the idea to call the project Digital Shades Vol. 1, and to make the album part of an ongoing series.  

M83's 2008 album Saturdays = Youth, released on Mute, was recorded with the help of Ken Thomas and Ewan Pearson. Four singles were released from the album: ""Couleurs"" in February 2008, ""Graveyard Girl"" in April, ""Kim & Jessie"" in July, and ""We Own the Sky"" in December.

In December 2008, M83 supported Kings of Leon on its UK tour. In January and February 2009, M83 supported The Killers across USA tour dates and toured with Depeche Mode on its Tour of the Universe in Italy, Germany, and France.

The double album Hurry Up, We're Dreaming was released on 17th October 2011, through  Naïve, produced by Justin Meldal-Johnson (Beck, NIN, The Mars Volta, Goldfrapp) and including contributions from Zola Jesus, Brad Laner (from 90's band Medicine) on guitar, and the vocalist Morgan Kibby. The album was preceded by the track ""Midnight City"" released in July 2011.

Fleetwood Mac,"Fleetwood Mac is a British and American rock band formed in 1967. From the band's inception through the end of 1974, no incarnation of Fleetwood Mac lasted longer than two years, but all featured core members Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. Their two most successful periods have been during the late 60s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist/singer-songwriter Peter Green, and from 1975 to 1987, when they went a pop-oriented direction with musicians Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, and Stevie Nicks.

The band enjoyed more modest success in the intervening period between 1971 and 1974, with a line-up that included Bob Welch, and also during the 90s, which saw more personnel changes before the return of Nicks and Buckingham in 1997. More recently, the departure of Christine McVie from Fleetwood Mac in 1998 shifted around the group's plans for many years. McVie returned to the fold in 2014 and a coming tour featuring the reunited line-up is in the works.

The only member present in the band from the very beginning is its namesake drummer Mick Fleetwood. Bassist John McVie, despite his giving part of his name to the band, did not play on their first single nor at their first concerts. Keyboardist Christine McVie has, to date, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album 'Kiln House'.

The band was started in London in 1967 by guitarist Peter Green, who recruited the rhythm section of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers: drummer Mick Fleetwood and bass guitarist John McVie. Green himself had replaced a departing member, Eric Clapton, as the lead guitarist of the ""Bluesbreakers;"" Green and McVie had appeared on John Mayall's 1967 A Hard Road album. The band employed another bassist, Bob Brunning, until John McVie was persuaded to join the band. (The band's first album Fleetwood Mac contains one song with Brunning on bass.) Slide-guitarist and Elmore James devotee, Jeremy Spencer, rounded out the lineup.

After its second album, Mr. Wonderful, a third guitarist, 18-year-old Danny Kirwan, was added to the lineup. At this point the band began shifting into a more melodic, introspective, and experimental/progressive mode. Most performances were built around the twin leads of Green and Kirwan, and Kirwan's songwriting was featured in nearly equal proportion to Green's. After releasing two successful singles, the instrumental ""Albatross"" (which remains the band's only #1 hit in the UK), and the ballad ""Man of the World"" [#2 UK], it produced what is often considered the best album of the band's Peter Green era, Then Play On. Spencer was, for the most part, absent from these recording sessions. The epic 2-part ""Oh Well"" single followed [#2 UK], and was included in later pressings of the U.S. LP album (and in all CDs). The band was then rocked by Peter Green's decision to leave. Debate rages on the reasons for this, but it is agreed that Green wished to play a more experimental and improvisational style. Drugs, particularly LSD, also played a large part, as Green recorded sporadically before falling into a twenty-year period of mental illness. After a short gap, Christine McVie (a.k.a. under her maiden name Christine Perfect) joined the band on keyboards, and the band moved from the blues to a more melodic pop style.

The early 1970s of Fleetwood Mac were turbulent for the band, which gained and lost members at a troubling rate. Jeremy Spencer disappeared during an American tour, and was found to have joined the controversial Children of God cult. American guitarist Bob Welch joined up, at the suggestion of good friend Judy Wong, lending a jazz-rock flavor to Kirwan's more melodic songs. Kirwan's and Welch's tenures overlapped by two albums, but eventually, Kirwan's own erratic behavior on tour led to his dismissal in late 1972. Welch's contributions included ""Future Games"" (from 1971's Future Games), ""Sentimental Lady"" (from 1972's Bare Trees), and ""Hypnotized"" (from 1973's Mystery To Me).

Bob Weston (guitar) and Savoy Brown's Dave Walker (vocals) were also briefly hired during this phase of the band. Walker was fired after just one album, but the firing of Weston, for an alleged affair with Mick Fleetwood's wife, during a late 1973 tour led to that tour's abrupt cancellation. This led its manager, Clifford Davis, to send another dummy band out on the road billed as ""Fleetwood Mac,"" but featuring no original members of the band, resulting in a year-long legal battle. The fake Fleetwood Mac scored one hit a couple of years later (""Why Did You Do It?"") under their new name Stretch

In late 1974, Welch indicated that he intended to leave the band, and Fleetwood and John McVie needed to fill the possible vacancy. While Fleetwood was scouting Van Nuys, California's Sound City Studios, house engineer Keith Olsen played a track titled ""Frozen Love,"" which he had mixed there for an obscure American duo, Buckingham Nicks. Fleetwood liked what he heard, and he was introduced to the guitarist, Lindsey Buckingham, who just happened to be in the building. When Welch resigned from the band, Fleetwood asked Buckingham to join. Buckingham agreed, on the condition that his musical partner and girlfriend, Stevie Nicks, also become part of the band.

In 1975, under new management by Gabriele Arras, the new lineup released the eponymous Fleetwood Mac (otherwise known as The White Album). This proved to be a breakthrough for the band and it became a huge hit. The band was catapulted into stardom. Among the hit singles from this album were Christine McVie's ""Over My Head"" and ""Say You Love Me,"" and Stevie Nicks's ""Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win).""

But in 1976, with the success of the band also came the end of John and Christine McVie's marriage, as well as Buckingham's and Nicks's longtime romantic relationship. Pressure was put on Fleetwood Mac to release a successful follow-on album, which, when combined with its new-found wealth, led to creative and personal tensions, fuelled by large amounts of drug and alcohol consumption, especially cocaine.

The album the band members created was Rumours in 1977, in which the band lays bare the emotional turmoil experienced at that time. It became the best- selling album of the year, and it sold over 19 million copies worldwide by 1998. The RIAA certified Rumours as a diamond album.

This lineup of the band continued to record for over a decade. Their 1979 album Tusk was a double album, more experimental in tone, still spawning three hit singles but selling nowhere near the quantity of Rumours.  After solo albums by Nicks and Buckingham, 1982's Mirage was a return to more commercial pop, but still didn't reproduce the success of Rumours.  The band went on hiatus, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham continuing solo careers and Christine McVie issuing a solo album as well.

In 1987, the band reconvened for Tango In The Night, some of which was originally destined for another Buckingham solo disc. The disc sold well and had several hit singles, but Buckingham refused to tour with the band and they parted ways acrimoniously. Buckingham was replaced with Rick Vito and Billy Burnette for the Tango In The Night tour, and this new lineup recorded the 1990 album Behind The Mask, which did not enjoy much commercial success. In 1991, Nicks and Vito announced they were leaving the band. Bekka Bramlett joined, and this lineup eventually recorded the unsuccessful album Time in 1995.

In 1997, the ""classic"" Rumours line-up reunited for an MTV reunion special called The Dance. The live album sold over 5 million copies in the United States and spawned a 40-city tour. Following The Dance, Christine McVie retired from the band permanently, and the remaining four (Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood) produced a new album released in 2003 called Say You Will. The new album included 18 new songs written by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. They then went on an 18-month worldwide tour over the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe.

In interviews given in November 2006 to support his solo album, Under The Skin, Buckingham stated that there were plans for the band to reunite once more for a 2008 tour but recording plans had been put on hold for the foreseeable future. In a September 2007 interview Stevie Nicks gave to the UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, she noted that she is unwilling to carry on with the band unless Christine McVie returns. However in a recent interview, Mick Fleetwood said ""...be very happy and hopeful that we will be working again. I can tell you everyone's going to be extremely excited about what's happening with Fleetwood Mac.""

On June 9, 2008, The New York Times reported that Irving Azoff is in the process of negotiating a deal with Wal-Mart for Fleetwood Mac's new album. The article states ""Mr. Azoff said that he was already talking to Wal-Mart about an exclusive deal for Fleetwood Mac’s next release. 'Classic rock really works there,' Mr. Azoff said.""

According to Stevie Nicks, ""the group will start working on material and recording probably in October, and finish an album.""

However, instead of returning to the studio, the band instead went back out on the road in 2009 for a greatest hits tour called ""Fleetwood Mac Unleashed,"" the first time the band have gone out on tour without an album to support. The tour saw the band play throughout the United States as well as returning, for the first time in years, to play dates in Canada, Europe, and the UK.

On January 11, 2014, Mick Fleetwood announced that Christine McVie would be rejoining Fleetwood Mac, and the news was confirmed on January 13.

The White Stripes,"The White Stripes were an alternative rock band, formed in 1997 in Detroit, Michigan, United States. They disbanded in 2011. The group consisted of songwriter Jack White (vocals, piano/keyboards, guitar) and Meg White (drums, vocals).

After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit independent music underground, The White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002, as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful albums White Blood Cells and Elephant drew them attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom.
 
The White Stripes used a low-fidelity, do-it-yourself approach to writing and recording. Their music features a melding of punk and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo is also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which features a simple color scheme of red, white, and black.

The White Stripes' discography consists of six studio albums, two extended plays (EP), one video album, 26 singles and fourteen music videos. The band has sold approximately 12 million albums worldwide, 2 million in the US alone, and their latest three albums have each won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

On February 2, 2011, the band announced on their website that they had disbanded.

Depeche Mode,"Depeche Mode are an English synthpop band, founded in 1980, originally from the town of Basildon, Essex, United Kingdom. They are one of the most enduring and successful bands to have emerged during the 80s, and particularly from the new wave/new romantic era. The band name is derived from a French fashion magazine, Dépêche mode, which means  ""fashion dispatch.""

The band have been highly influential in the electronic dance music scene, especially synthpop, techno and trance, in part due to their innovative work, recording techniques and use of sampling. Their most successful album is arguably 1990's Violator, which reached the #2 position in the UK, #7 in the US, and sold over 8 million copies worldwide. The band has released a long series of high-charting singles over their three-decades long career. Enjoy the Silence is their most recognized song and is one of the most covered songs in history. 

The original line-up was Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore, Andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke. In December 1981, Clarke left the band and later went on to form Yazoo, The Assembly and Erasure. Alan Wilder joined the group initially in January 1982 as a live keyboardist but became an official member in December 1982. He left mid-1995 to fully concentrate on his Recoil project and the band continued as a trio. In 2010 Wilder re-joined Depeche Mode on stage after 16 years, for a performance of Somebody during a show at London's Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Depeche Mode's origins date back to 1977, when Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher formed a band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass. Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke and Fletcher switched to synthesizers. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local scout hut jam session, singing to a rendition of David Bowie's ""Heroes"", and Depeche Mode were born. 

While playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town, the band were approached by Daniel Miller, the founder of Mute Records, who proposed them a verbal contract. The result was their first single Dreaming of Me, recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981, reaching number 57 in the UK charts and followed soon by a real contract with Mute.

To date, Depeche Mode have released:
14 studio albums: Speak & Spell (1981), A Broken Frame (1982), Construction Time Again (1983), Some Great Reward (1984), Black Celebration (1986), Music For the Masses (1987), Violator (1990), Songs of Faith and Devotion (1993), Ultra (1997), Exciter (2001), Playing the Angel (2005),  Sounds of the Universe (2009), Delta Machine (2013) and Spirit (2017);

The Smiths,"The Smiths were a rock band which formed in 1982 in Manchester, England, United Kingdom. The band consisted of  Morrissey (vocals, lyrics), Johnny Marr (guitar, music), Mike Joyce (drums) and Andy Rourke (bass). Hugely influential, The Smiths lasted all of five years from 1982 to 1987, releasing during this period four studio albums (The Smiths, Meat Is Murder, The Queen Is Dead and Strangeways, Here We Come) and three compilation albums (Hatful Of Hollow, The World Won't Listen and Louder Than Bombs). Meat Is Murder went on to enter the British charts at number one in February of 1985, and The Queen Is Dead further confirmed the band's popularity with its release in spring 1986. Greeted with enthusiastic reviews and peaking at number two on the U.K. charts, the album also developed The Smiths' cult following in the U.S., breaking into the Top 100.

After the band's split in 1987, a further six albums have been released, bringing the total number of Smiths albums to 13. These albums consisted of another five compilation albums (Best... I, ...Best II, Singles, The Very Best of the Smiths and The Sound of the Smiths), and one live album (Rank) recorded before the band's split during The Queen Is Dead tour. Both ""Best I"" and ""Best II"" were heavily criticised by critics and some fans; ""The Very Best of"", was very similar content to said ""Best"" albums, sold excellently, but drew much criticism from press and the band, who had no input.

Former members

Bass was originally played by Dale Hibbert, but he was replaced after 4 months. Craig Gannon was briefly a second guitarist for the band in 1986.

In Copenhagen, Denmark 2013, she was recognized as P3s Uundgåelige (P3 Unavoidable), a list of rising artists Danish radio station DR P3. She is signed to Sony Music. MØ's first live television appearance was during Danish P3 Guld Awards on 27 March 2013 where she sang her hit ""Pilgrim"". MØ, whose name means ""maiden"" or ""virgin"" in Danish, has been compared to electro-pop vocalists such as Grimes, Purity Ring, and Twin Shadow. 

MØ's debut single ""Glass"" was released in early 2013, some time after the release of the teaser song ""Maiden"" was released on 2 May 2012. The second single, ""Pilgrim"" was initially released on limited-edition 7"" vinyl single through Turntable Kitchen's Pairings Box, with ""Maiden"" appearing on the B-side. ""Pilgrim"" was MØ's first song to chart on the Danish Singles chart, peaking at number 11. ""Glass"", ""Pilgrim"" and ""Maiden"" all got remixed for a remix EP, simply titled Remixes, released on 12 April 2013. 
Following the releases of the singles ""Waste of Time"" and ""XXX 88"" featuring Diplo, MØ released her debut EP titled Bikini Daze EP. None of the previously released singles, except ""XXX 88"" appeared on the EP. The EP charted on the US Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, peaking at number 11. 
MØ also provided vocals for the song ""Dear Boy"", which appeared on Swedish DJ and producer Avicii's debut album True and ""Let The Youth Go Mad"" which appeared on the Lifestyle Mixtape by the Broke.

In 2014, MØ released three singles (""Don't Wanna Dance"", a cover of the Spice Girls song ""Say You'll Be There"" and ""Walk This Way""). On 24 March that year, her debut album No Mythologies to Follow was released. The standard edition included all the singles, excluding ""Say You'll Be There"" which became a iTunes exclusive, that MØ had released until that point. It also included four brand new tracks, ""Maiden"" and ""Never Wanna Know"", the latter having already been released on the Bikini Daze EP. The deluxe version included four new songs plus slower versions of other songs on the album (namely ""Fire Rides"", ""Dust Is Gone"", ""Slow Love"" and ""The Sea""). The iTunes deluxe version included the previously mentioned Spice Girls cover and also the MS MR remix of ""Pilgrim"". The original version of ""The Sea"" was also featured on the soundtrack for the Danish dramatic horror mystery film When Animals Dream.
MØ collaborated with two artists during 2014: she first sang along with Swedish singer Elliphant on the song called ""One More"" and then she sang the chorus for the Australian rapper Iggy Azalea's single ""Beg For It"". The latter became her first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 27. On 30 December 2014, MØ released a new song titled ""New Year's Eve"". 

Not much was released in 2015, though MØ had her biggest hit to date that year. ""Lean On"", a song produced by MØ's frequent collaborator Diplo's dancehall project Major Lazer and DJ Snake, featured MØ's vocals. The song topped several charts around the world, including the Danish Singles chart and it also topped several year-ends charts for 2015. Another collaboration between MØ and Major Lazer (a cover of ""Lost"" by Frank Ocean"") was released later that year, however it didn't chart anywhere. 

MØ toured alongside the English trio Years & Years on their UK Tour during the spring of 2016. In May of that year, she released a new single titled ""Final Song"".

The Strokes,"The Strokes are an American rock band from New York City, New York, United States, formed in 1998. The band rose to fame in the early 2000s as a leading group in garage rock/post-punk revival. The band consists of Julian Casablancas (lead vocals), Nick Valensi (lead guitar), Albert Hammond, Jr. (rhythm guitar), Nikolai Fraiture (bass guitar) and Fabrizio Moretti (drums and percussion).
	 
Upon the release of their debut album, Is This It, in 2001, the group was met with much critical acclaim, being hailed by some as the ""saviors of rock and roll."" NME made Is This It their Album of the Year. Since then, the band has maintained a large fan base, notably in the UK, US and Australia. As of 2007, Is This It has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide.
	 
They released their second album Room on Fire in October 2003, to good reviews, but to less success commercially, although it still went gold. The album's sound maintained the Strokes' familiar reference points, while also evoking groups such as The Cars, Bob Marley, and Blondie. In the process, they made the cover of Spin Magazine for the second time, with each member receiving his own cover. They also made the cover of Rolling Stone for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress Drew Barrymore, which ended in January 2007.
	 
In late September 2005, ""Juicebox"", the first single from The Strokes then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single's release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. ""Juicebox"" became The Strokes' second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 the Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world.

Their third album, First Impressions of Earth, was released in January 2006 to mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, a first for the band. In Japan it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was ""like a scientific breakthrough"". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on Saturday Night Live playing ""Juicebox"" and ""You Only Live Once"".
	 
The Strokes' frontman Julian Casablancas and guitarist Nick Valensi started writing new material for their band's forthcoming new album in the latter stages of January 2009, which they were set to go in the studio to finalize in February of the same year. In February 2010, Julian Casablancas told NME that the band's fourth album was set to be released in September 2010. The release date has been pushed back again, and the album, titled ""Angles"" will now be released March 22, 2011 in America. The album's first single, ""Under Cover of Darkness"" was made available as a free download from the band's website on February 9, 2011 for a 48 hour period.

Bastille released their latest album, 'Bad Blood', on 4 March 2013 in the U.K. to international critical acclaim.

Bastille debuted in June 2011 with their 7"" single, ""Flaws""/""Icarus"" (released on Young & Lost Club). This was then followed by their EP 'Laura Palmer' later in 2011. After adding a few more tracks online, the band received a lot of attention from indie rock fans on the web, helping secure some support slots. During the summer of 2011, they performed at a number of major UK festivals, including Glastonbury, Isle of Wight, and Blissfields.

On 27 April 2012, ""Overjoyed"" came out, being the debut Virgin Records single from Bastille. This was confirmed by EMI on 1 May 2012. After the video release of ""Overjoyed"" on YouTube, 'Q Magazine' introduced the song as its track of the day for 7 March 2012. Fans seemingly devoured the tune.

""Bad Blood"" was released on Virgin Records on 20 August 2012. Following the video release of ""Bad Blood"" on YouTube, Bastille were named ""The New Band of the Day"" by writers for 'The Guardian' on 25 July 2012. In not too long, Bastille performed at the major UK Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2012. They played an October 2012 headline tour that brought them into the spotlight alongside Emeli Sandé, with Swiss Lips supporting them.

The Black Keys,"The Black Keys are a two-man blues-rock group from Akron, Ohio, United States which formed in 2001, consisting of singer and guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney. The band name was inspired by a schizophrenic artist and friend in Akron, who used the term ""black keys"" to describe things he disliked or people he did not trust. The Black Keys have roots in traditional blues and psychedelic rock stylings.

They released their first album, The Big Come Up, in 2002, followed by Thickfreakness in 2003, and Rubber Factory in 2004.

In 2006 they released Magic Potion, as well as the lesser-known Chulahoma and a single version of Your Touch.

One of their trademarks is their preference for simple, lo-fi recording techniques. They refuse to use big-name studios, and do most recording, producing, and mixing themselves. Most of Thickfreakness was recorded in about 14 hours in Carney's basement, using only an early 80's Tascam 388 8-track recorder. Often, their recordings still have background noises (such as an owl hooting).

The Black Keys have achieved increasing critical acclaim and recognition since their debut album, which itself received praise from Rolling Stone magazine. Time magazine named them one of the ""10 Best Acts of 2003"" (behind OutKast and The White Stripes). They have supported a number of bands: they toured with Sleater-Kinney in 2003, had a short stint opening for Beck, have recently opened for Radiohead on the American leg of their brief 2006 tour, and performed at Lollapalooza in 2005 and 2007. In addition to this, they were also well-liked by influential British radio DJ John Peel and appeared on both Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Late Show with David Letterman. Famous followers of the band include Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, and Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammet. Matt Helders, drummer for the Arctic Monkeys, can be seen in a Black Keys T-Shirt in an interview on MTV's RAW.

The Black Keys were included in the soundtrack of the 2003 movie School of Rock with their song, ""Set You Free"". ""Lies"" was featured in the conclusion of the February 4, 2009 episode of Lie to Me. One of their songs, ""Girl Is on My Mind"", was used in a 2006 Sony Ericsson advertisement, starring the tennis players Ana Ivanović and Daniela Hantuchová, gaining the band more commercial recognition.

""I'll Be Your Man"" is the opening theme song for the HBO show Hungand was also featured in an episode of the FX Network show Rescue Me. ""Your Touch"" can also be heard in the film Zombieland and in an episode of ""Eastbound and Down"" on HBO. The song ""I Got Mine"" has been used in HBO's sports reality series 24/7 Pacquiao-Hatton"" [13] as well as background music for the 2009 American League Championship Series. The song ""Next Girl"" is featured in the in game radio of Saints Row the Third.

Their fourth record that Danger Mouse produced Attack & Release  was out April 1st 2008. The duo's fifth album is the first one recorded in a proper studio.

Co-produced by Danger Mouse, the album was released to critical acclaim, receiving positive reviews from The Rolling Stones, NME and more. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly commented on ""El Camino"", saying that ""El Camino trades the soulful stylings of Brothers for harder-driving, faster-riffing rock & roll"". At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, El Camino won the award for Best Rock Album, while ""Lonely Boy"" received multiple honors, taking 'Best Rock Performance' and 'Best Rock Song'. The album has sold 1.4 million copies in the United States to date.

System of a Down,"System of a Down is an Armenian American alternative metal band, formed in 1994 in Los Angeles, California, USA. All four members are of Armenian descent, and are widely known for their outspoken views expressed in many of their songs confronting the Armenian Genocide of 1915 by the Ottoman Empire and the ongoing War on Terror by the US government. The band consists of Serj Tankian (vocals), Daron Malakian (vocals, guitar), Shavo Odadjian (bass, vocals) and John Dolmayan (drums).
System of a Down has achieved commercial success with five albums, and many singles such as their breakout hit ""Chop Suey!"", ""Toxicity"", ""Aerials"", ""B.Y.O.B."", ""Question!"", ""Hypnotize"" and ""Lonely Day"". Their works have earned them one Grammy Award amongst three nominations.

The band has been influenced by heavy metal, punk rock and Armenian folk.

System of a Down went on hiatus in 2006, with Serj Tankian pursuing a solo career and Daron Malakian and John Dolmayan forming Scars on Broadway. Shavo joined together with RZA from the Wu-Tang clan to form Hip-Hop group Achozen. 

System of a Down is a part of the Axis of Justice, a non-profit organization formed by band member Serj Tankian (along with Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine), dedicated to bringing together musicians, music fans, and grassroots political organizations to fight for social justice.

Soil (1993–1995)
The roots of System of a Down lie in the band Soil (not to be confused with the current band SOiL), a group from Los Angeles that included Serj Tankian on vocals/keyboard, and Daron Malakian on vocals/guitar, as well as Dave Hakopyan (Bassist for Mt. Helium) on bass and Domingo Laranio (Local Hawaii Drummer) on drums. Shavo Odadjian joined Soil near their end as a guitarist. After three years, only one live show, and one jam session recording, the band split up.

In the beginning (1995–1997)
After Soil split up, Serj and Daron formed a new band, System of a Down, based on a poem that Daron wrote. The poem's title was ""Victims of the Down"", but Shavo Odadjian, who was originally the band's manager and promoter, didn't like the word and thought the word ""System"" sounded better. Ever since Shavo joined as bassist, managerial duties have been undertaken by the Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group and founder David ""Beno"" Benveniste. The band then found a drummer, Andy Khachaturian. System of a Down quickly made what is known as their early Untitled 1995 Demo Tape, which had very early recordings of ""Mr. Jack"" (called ""PIG""), along with songs called ""Flake"", ""Toast"" and an early recording of ""The Metro"", a cover of the Berlin song of the same name. It is rumored that there are other tapes made, which contain early recordings of ""Friik"", ""36"" (called "".36""), and ""Roulette"". Two other songs, ""X"" (called ""Multiply"") and ""Honey"" were live demos at the time and were played at very early shows. After this, the band recorded Demo Tape 1, which had early versions of ""Sugar"", ""Suite-Pee"", and ""P.L.U.C.K."", as well as ""Dam."" Demo Tape 2 was released in 1996 and had a rough demo of the song ""Soil"" as well as the most known unreleased tracks such as ""Honey"" and ""Temper."" At the beginning of 1997, SOAD recorded their final publicly-released demo tape, Demo Tape 3, which had rough versions of ""Peephole"", ""War?"", and ""Know."" In mid 1997, Ontronik Khachaturian left the band due to a hand injury. Soon after playing at the Whisky-A-Go-Go and Viper Room with new drummer John Dolmayan, producer Rick Rubin caught the band's attention and told them to keep in touch with him. Showing great interest, they recorded Demo Tape 4 near the end of that year. This demo, however, was made only to be sent to record companies. The tape was not released to the public until years later when it was leaked onto the Internet. After Rick helped them get signed onto American/Columbia Records, SOAD began to record in his studio. In 1997 SOAD won the Best Signed Band award from the Rock City Awards. Prior to 1998, SOAD's live shows were called ""The Dark Red Experience"".

Debut album (1998–2000)
In the summer of 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, System of a Down. They enjoyed moderate success with their first single ""Sugar"" becoming a radio favorite, followed by the single ""Spiders"". After the release of the album, System of a Down toured extensively, opening for Slayer before making their way to the second stage of Ozzfest. Following Ozzfest, they toured with Fear Factory and Incubus before headlining the Sno-Core tour with Puya, Mr. Bungle, The Cat and Incubus providing support. System was scheduled to play the 1999 Family Values Tour, but were kicked off by Fred Durst over his inability to sign the band Taproot. Fred Durst has since admitted that he was a ""complete wanker"" in relation to this ""oversight"". The band have yet to comment on Durst's involvement or commentary. In 2000, the group contributed their cover of the Black Sabbath song ""Snowblind"" to the Sabbath tribute album Nativity in Black 2.

Toxicity, Steal This Album! (2001–2003)
The group's big break arrived when their second album Toxicity debuted at #1 on the American and Canadian charts, eventually achieving multi-platinum certification. The album has since sold 6 million copies worldwide. It was still on top in America on the week of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding their hit single ""Chop Suey!"" causing it to be taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics at the time such as ""(I don't think you) trust in my self-righteous suicide."" Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the second single, ""Toxicity"". Even with the controversy surrounding ""Chop Suey!"" which earned a Grammy nomination, System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with ""Toxicity "" and ""Aerials"". In May 2006, VH1 listed Toxicity in the #14 slot in the 40 Greatest Metal Songs.

In 2001, the band went on tour with Slipknot in the United States and Mexico. After seeing the success of the tour, System and Slipknot went on a Pledge of Allegiance Tour with Rammstein in 2002. In late 2001, a few unreleased tracks made their way onto the Internet. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material. Soon after, the band released the final versions of the songs, which were recorded at the same time, but hadn't been used for Toxicity. The result was Steal This Album!, released in November 2002. Steal This Album! resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to Abbie Hoffman's counter-culture book, Steal This Book and as a message to those who stole the songs and released them on the Internet. ""Steal This Album was the lowest rated album that we had ever made"" Dolmayan said in an interview. The song ""Innervision"" was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for ""Boom!"" was filmed with director Michael Moore as a protest against the War in Iraq.

Mezmerize / Hypnotize (2004–2005)
From 2004 to 2005, the group produced a double album, Mezmerize/Hypnotize with the two parts released six months apart. The first album, Mezmerize, was released on May 17, 2005, to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at #1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of a Down's second #1 album. First week sales rocketed to over 800,000 copies worldwide. The Grammy Award-winning single ""B.Y.O.B."", which questions the integrity of war, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The next single, ""Question!"" was released with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the release of Mezmerize, the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with The Mars Volta and Bad Acid Trip supporting.

The second part of the double album, Hypnotize, was released on November 22, 2005. Like Mezmerize, it debuted at #1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with the Beatles, Guns 'N Roses, and rappers 2Pac and DMX, the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at #1 in the same year.

In February 2006, the band won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for ""B.Y.O.B."", beating out other established artists such as Nine Inch Nails and Robert Plant. Their second single off the Hypnotize album, ""Lonely Day"" was released in March in the United States. System of a Down released ""Kill Rock 'N Roll"" and ""Vicinity of Obscenity"" as their next promo singles. The band headlined Ozzfest 2006 in cities where tour founder Ozzy Osbourne opted not to appear or wasn't playing on the main stage. These shows turned out to be the bands last performances together to date.

Hiatus and Future (2006–present)
In May 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Daron Malakian has confirmed the break will probably last a few years, but it was Shavo who in an interview with Guitar magazine said it will last at least 3 years, but insists that the band would not be splitting up. He told MTV, ""We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We've done System for over ten years, and I think it's healthy to take a rest.""

During their performance in Houston, Texas, Malakian also took a moment to say, ""There's been a lot of rumors about us breaking up. Well, don't listen to them. Us four right here, we will always be System of a Down!"" However, Malakian announced he was forming a band called Scars on Broadway, which has since been joined by Dolmayan, and will work on its debut album during autumn. Odadjian will be working on a project with RZA of Wu-Tang Clan named Achozen as well as his UrSession website/record label. Tankian plans to keep recording as a solo artist/producer with his first single being Empty Walls off his first album Elect the Dead which was released on October 23, 2007, while Dolmayan, on top of Scars on Broadway, plans to open a comic book store online, which should be up online in November 2007.

System of a Down's final performance before their hiatus took place on August 13, 2006 in West Palm Beach, Florida, as part of the 2006 Ozzfest Festival. ""Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together"", Malakian told the crowd during Sunday's last performance. ""We'll be back. We just don't know when."" It was stated by Sharon Osbourne that System of a Down was paid ""about $325,000 a show.""

System of a Down's songs were used in the 2006 film ""Screamers"" by Carla Garapedian. ""Screamers"" debuted in theaters in large city markets such as New York City, Detroit, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Fresno, Providence, and Boston. An earlier engagement started exclusively in Los Angeles on [December 8], 2006.

System of a Down was honored at the USC v. Cal game at the Los Angeles Coliseum in Los Angeles, CA in 2006. The Spirit of Troy also known as the Trojan Marching Band performed three System of a Down songs. The marching band was honored to play ""Toxicity"", ""Sugar"", and Hypnotize"" along with John Dolmayan and Shavo Odadjian.

Tankian recently said that he has wanted to work on his ""solo record for years"". As for the future of the band, he said that he does not know whether System of a Down is over or not. He also stated that ""maybe in a few years"" the band would ""want to make another album. It's impossible to tell right now. It'll be later down the line; then we'll be able to tell what might happen.""

Bassist Shavo Odadjian was recently revealed to be directing the first video for the comeback of the hardcore punk band, Bad Brains.

For the 2007 Grammys, System of a Down was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance for ""Lonely Day"", but lost to Wolfmother and their song ""Woman"".

Shavo Odadjian recently told Launch Radio Networks that System of a Down is ""alive and well"".
“We're just not working together right now. We kind of like split up at first, but you know, we're brothers, man, we'll take bullets for each other. So it's like, you kind of miss each other after a while and you, one guy makes the first move, then another starts making phone calls....this is a juggernaut, man. System of a Down is my lifeline. It'll never go away. We could not make a record for 10 years — that's not gonna happen, but I'm just saying we could — and we'll come back strong.”

Future and possible Reunion
When asked in February 2008 if a reunion was planned any time in the future, Daron Malakian had admitted that System of a Down may never get back together again. He had this to say: “There's no talk of System doing anything. We're not planning on doing anything. If anyone's holding their breath for a System record, they're going to turn blue and pass out. It's a long ways away, if it ever even happens. We don't even talk about it - none of us. This (Scars on Broadway) is my band right now.”

On September 14, 2007 an American TV interview video with Shavo Odadjian was posted online, and subsequently embedded on the MySpace profile of his current working band, Achozen. He commented on System of a Down's status and future, saying: “We're taking a break. It got to a point where we we're kinda...not implode but like, y'know, I saw something and [inaudible]... Thirteen years of non stop y'know, so- and we all have things we wanna do... Everyone and their mother wants to say that we are breaking up, that we broke up. It's like, everyone talks to me 'Oh you guys broke up' no we didn't break up, why d'ya want us to brea- you want us to break up, we'll break up!”

In a September 13, 2007 interview, frontman Serj Tankian offered his take on the band's future by saying: ""It's very simple. System of a Down, we've been a band for 11 years, or 12 years. We've put out five records, we're all friends. We're still friends. And we decided to take time to pursue our own artistic and personal goals. And unlike a company like Nabisco that puts out crackers every year, or cookies every year, we're artists, we're friends. So we don't have to necessarily do things the same way every year. So we took time to do our own things and we left the door open. We're all friends. If we ever want to get together and speak to the world as System of a Down, then we will. If not, then we'll...the door is open.”

When asked if there could be a possible reunion one day, he responded by saying: ""It's very possible"".

In an April 2008 interview with Kerrang magazine, guitarist Daron Malakian and drummer John Dolmayan (who have recently formed a side project known as Scars on Broadway) gave their takes on the bands future. When told that many people are going to wonder what the future of the band is, Malakian responded by stating that: ""We'll all know when the time is right"". Dolmayan added: ""It'll just happen"". Malakian went on to say: “Yeah. It'll feel good and happen. I can respect this situation (System's hiatus) more than I can respect the situation where two people are like, 'The lead singer fucked my girlfriend!' and that kind of bullshit. Nah, man. The lead singer is a special person to me and I am to him. And that's how we ended off. Same with Shavo, same with John. And it will always be. It was a big part of my life. We were onstage together for a long time, man. We went through shit as a band and friends -- we slept in RVs together!”

In an interview with Tankian about Big Day Out 2009 (a show which involved playing his Elect the Dead album live with the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, and a few songs from his then-upcoming second studio album) Tankian stated, ""Every few months I am honored to hear interesting rumors about whether the band is going to tour or break up permanently. I find them all to be very entertaining.""

On October 31, 2009, Odadjian threw a Halloween party at the Roxy during which he, Malakian, and Dolmayan performed ""Suite-Pee"" (off System of a Down), Scars on Broadway's ""They Say,"" and an unknown song.  This performance was followed by another partial reunion of the band on November 20, 2009, at the Avalon in Hollywood during which Malakian, Dolmayan, and Odadjian played ""Aerials"" and ""Toxicity.""

Reunion (2011)
On Monday, November 29th, 2010, System of a Down announced on their website that they would reform for a string of large European festival dates in June 2011.  Among the announced tour dates included UK's Download Festival, Switzerland's Greenfield Festival, Germany's Rock am Ring/Rock im Park and Sweden's Metaltown festivals. In their reunion statement posted on their website, the band was unclear as to the extent of their reformation. It read, ""We have no master plan of sorts -- we are playing these shows simply because we want to play together again as a band and for you, our amazing fans.""

From late February to early March 2012, they headlined five dates at Soundwave festival. This was the band's first visit to Australia since 2005. The band have continued playing around the world. On August 11 and 12, 2012, they played the Heavy MTL and Heavy T.O. music festivals in Montreal and Toronto, respectively. On February 4, 2013, it was announced that System of a Down would play the UK's Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2013, among other festivals and venues. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

blink-182,"Blink-182 is an American rock band formed in Poway, a suburb of San Diego, California in 1992. The band currently consists of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Blink-182 is considered a key group in the development of pop punk; the band's combination of pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. Founded by Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor.

Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until the Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; the band appended ""-182"". Cheshire Cat (1995) led the band to tour with Pennywise and NOFX on the Warped Tour. Dude Ranch (1997) was co-distributed by major label MCA Records and featured the band's first rock radio hit, ""Dammit (Growing Up)"". Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. Enema of the State (1999) was an enormous success on the strength of hit singles ""What's My Age Again?"", ""Adam's Song"" and ""All the Small Things"", which enjoyed massive airplay and became MTV staples. Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) reached number one in the United States, Canada, and Germany. The eponymously titled Blink-182 followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group, infusing experimental elements into the group's usual pop punk formula, resulting in a more mature sound. DeLonge left the group in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an ""indefinite hiatus"". The trio reunited in 2009, producing the band's sixth album, Neighborhoods (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again exited and was replaced by Alkaline Trio guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. The band's seventh studio album, California, is set for release on July 1, 2016.

Blink-182 has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States,[1, and over 35 million albums worldwide. In 2011, The New York Times asserted, ""no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182,"" and even as the band receded after its 2005 split, ""its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine.""

Early years (1992-1998)

In May 1993, Blink recorded their first demo tape, entitled ""Flyswatter"", in drummer Scott Raynor's bedroom. A 4-track was used to record the material. According to Hoppus, only around fifty copies of the demo were produced to give to their family and friends. Before the end of the year, the band released another two demos, one commonly known as Demo #2 while the other was entitled Buddha. Of this last record around 1,000 copies  were produced  by Filter Records, an independent record company headed by Hoppus's boss.

In early 1994, Blink signed with Cargo Records. The band recorded their début full-length album, ""Cheshire Cat"" in three days. The album contained a number of updated versions of songs such as ""Carousel"", ""Strings"", ""Sometimes"" and ""TV"" that had appeared on the ""Buddha Promo Tape"" as well as some originals.

Shortly after the release of ""Cheshire Cat"", Blink was threatened with legal action by a pop band in Ireland of the same name. In order to avoid a dispute, Blink appended ""182"" to the end of their name. The band has cited a variety of reasons for ultimately choosing 182, with some of the more common explanations being the number of times Tony Montana utters the word ""fuck"" in Scarface, references to the 1985 Timothy Hutton film, Turk 182!, the band's ideal weight, the number of half the days in a year and the number of miles Hoppus had to drive to visit his girlfriend. However, DeLonge has stated that it is just a number that they ""pulled out of their ass"".

After moving to Encinitas, California, the band recorded the album ""Dude Ranch"" in 1996 with producer Mark Trombino. blink-182 recorded the album under Cargo Records, but signed with MCA which later became Geffen Records in 1996, in order to handle increased distribution. The album was released in 1997 and was relatively commercially successful, selling 4 million copies worldwide.

The single ""Dammit"" did well on U.S. modern rock charts, however drummer Scott Raynor later left the band. There are two common explanations for his removal - that Raynor had a serious drinking problem and was asked to go into rehab or face ejection, or alternately, that he departed in order to attend college. Raynor claims he agreed to go to rehab, but that DeLonge and Hoppus were doubtful of his sincerity and subsequently fired him over the phone.

Hoppus and DeLonge had asked drummer Travis Barker of blink-182's support band The Aquabats to fill in for Raynor for the remainder of the tour, thus he had to learn all of the songs in a matter of hours before the show. He ultimately went on to join the band permanently afterwards, leaving The Aquabats.

In 1999, blink-182 hired Jerry Finn as its producer and recorded ""Enema of the State"". This album propelled the band into the mainstream with hit singles ""What's My Age Again?"", ""All the Small Things"" and ""Adam's Song"". All gained a significant amount of airtime on radio and MTV. Enema of the State went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide making it the band's best-selling album to that point.

In 1999 the band also had small parts in the film American Pie, though Travis Barker was incorrectly credited as Scott Raynor.

In 2000, the band released The Urethra Chronicles, a DVD which featured behind-the-scenes information. ""The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show: The Enema Strikes Back"", blink-182's live album, was also released in 2000, featuring songs from their three full-length records. The album also included one new studio song, ""Man Overboard,"" among the live renditions. The album quickly went out of print making it a much sought after item. A limited edition was printed in October 2006.

The band continued its commercial success with ""Take Off Your Pants and Jacket"" in 2001, which was in the same vein as ""Enema of the State"". However, a European tour in winter 2001 was canceled in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. Rescheduled dates in early 2002 were also canceled due to DeLonge's problems with his back.

In 2002, blink-182 co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Green Day, along with supporting acts Jimmy Eat World and a little known band called Kut U Up. The tour was documented, from Kut U Up's point of view, on the DVD Riding In Vans With Boys.

After taking some time off in 2002, recording of the next record began in early 2003. The band released its next studio album on November 18, 2003. It featured the hit singles ""Feeling This"", ""I Miss You"", ""Down"", and ""Always"". According to Barker, the ""Untitled"" record was supposed to represent a new blink-182. It received significant airplay on radio and TV. The Cure front man Robert Smith, often cited as a major influence on the band, appeared on ""All of This"". During late 2003, the band embarked on the ""Dolla Bill"" tour, named for the inexpensive ticket costs (It was originally planned to be completely free but later realised that it would be necessary to charge something for the ticket). A tour with No Doubt in the summer of 2004 was also very successful.

Indefinite hiatus and new bands/spinoffs (2005-2009)

In mid-February 2005 the band inexplicably cancelled a performance at Music for Relief's Concert for South Asia (a show put on to aid victims of the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake). Shortly there after, before a planned final US spring tour, on February 22, 2005, the band announced they were going on an ""indefinite hiatus"".

Geffen Records released a Greatest Hits compilation on November 1, 2005 in the U.S., one previously unreleased track was included ""Another Girl Another Planet"" (a cover song originally by The Only Ones). The song was also used as the theme song to Barker's new reality TV show, Meet the Barkers. Included was the previously issued ""I Miss You"" B-side and blink-182 album bonus track ""Not Now"". The album reached number 6 on the Billboard 200 in the United States.

DeLonge announced his new band, Angels & Airwaves. As his reason for why blink-182 went on indefinite hiatus, DeLonge suggested the mounting tension between himself and Hoppus, ultimately caused by DeLonge's desire for a break with his family coupled with Hoppus' feelings of betrayal after the formation of Box Car Racer. He also announced his plans to create a film about the final days of blink-182. Angels & Airwaves released their debut album ""We Don't Need to Whisper"" on May 23rd, 2006, where it debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200.

Hoppus and Barker's new project +44 surfaced on December 13, 2005 with the song, ""No It Isn't"". Coincidentally, the song was released on +44's official MySpace on the same day that Angels & Airwaves were slated to release their first song (and also Tom DeLonge's 30th birthday), though the release of the latter was delayed. Initially, Hoppus was hesitant to admit any deliberate correlation between the song and breakup, but has since admitted the song was about DeLonge and the breakup of the band. +44 released their first album ""When Your Heart Stops Beating"" on November 14, 2006 and debuted at number 10 on the Billboard 200.

In August 2006, Hoppus gave an extensive interview with B182.com. The interview focused on blink-182 and the unexplained events that had led to the band's hiatus. Contrary to DeLonge's statements, Hoppus said that the band had been getting along at the time of their final album. Hoppus went on to say that DeLonge requested a half-year respite from touring to spend time with his family, despite a planned final spring U.S. tour. Hoppus and Barker hesitantly conceded, leading to the cancellation of the upcoming tour. Further problems arose in discussions regarding the band's future recording endeavors. It was at this point that Hoppus felt that blink-182 had ceased functioning as a band. Hoppus went on to state that he and Barker eventually formed +44 at the end of the European leg out of frustration for DeLonge's constant reluctance.

On April 5, 2007, it was confirmed that blink-182, along with Rancid and Green Day are some of the bands set to feature in a documentary about modern punk music. The film is titled One Nine Nine Four and looks at the genre of music in the nineties. It will consist of band interviews and archive footage, which will be all compiled together by the documentary makers Robot Academy Films in [pace]Australia. It's expected to be released early next year. Skateboarding legend Tony Hawk will narrate the film, which also features the likes of NOFX and The Offspring.
 
Travis Barker of +44 currently was asked if the band would get back together. He said ""I don't know, I haven't talked to Tom in a long time. I do however talk to Mark everyday."" 

On November 18th, 2008, after Travis Barker was in a small plane crash, Mark Hoppus updated his blog, himynameismark, with this statement:
""in the midst of everything else that has happened lately, tom, Travis, and i have all spoken together. first through a number of phone calls, and then a couple of weeks ago we all hung out for a few hours. they’ve all been great, very positive conversations. we’re just reconnecting as friends after four years of not talking. it’s a good thing."" 

He also stated that this doesn't mean a blink-182 reunion, but after several years they have finally begun speaking to each other again. Hoppus also talked about Travis Barker's brush with death in a plane crash in September 2008 and the death of their great friend and longtime producer Jerry Finn.

Blink-182 officially announced their reunion while presenting at the 2009 Grammy Awards. The band's Official Website confirmed the band's reunion with a statement on their website. This song, the first new material released by blink-182 following their indefinite hiatus, was posted in full to Blink182.com late on July 14, 2011, then officially premiered the following day at 10:30 a.m. on Los Angeles radio station KROQ. The Up All Night Songfacts reports that Up All Night, the first new material released by blink-182 following their indefinite hiatus, was posted in full to Blink182.com late on July 14, 2011, then officially premiered the following day at 10:30 a.m. on Los Angeles radio station KROQ.

 7th Album - ""California"" (2016)
""California"" is the band's seventh studio album, set for release on July 1, 2016 through BMG. The album was produced by John Feldmann and recorded at Foxy Studios in California, USA. It was the first album by the band to feature vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba (from Alkaline Trio), who replaced former member Tom DeLonge. ""Bored to Death"" was the first single to be released from the album, on April 27, 2016.

Justin Bieber,"Justin Drew Bieber (born March 1, 1994) Is a Canadian pop/R&B singer. He began his professional career on YouTube, where he was discovered by his future manager, Scooter Braun. Braun flew Bieber to Atlanta, Georgia, to consult with Usher and soon signed a record deal with Island.
The first part of his two-part debut album My World was released on November 17, 2009. Four successful pre-album singles have been released: “One Time”, “One Less Lonely Girl”, “Love Me”, and “Favorite Girl”, which were Top 15 hits on the Canadian Hot 100 and Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. This accomplishment made Bieber the only solo artist in Billboard history to have four singles from a debut album chart in the Top 40 of the Hot 100 before the album’s release. The album received positive reviews from critics, and debuted at #6 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 137,000 copies in its first week, which was the second best opening release for a new artist in 2009. It also debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart. As of the fifth week, the album has sold over 522,000 copies in the United States, and has been certified Platinum in Canada.

Britney Spears,"Britney Jean Spears (born on December 2, 1981 in Kentwood, LA, United States, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, United States) is a Grammy-winning multi-platinum American pop singer, songwriter, dancer and occasional actress. She debuted in 1998 with her single ...Baby One More Time. She is one of the most influential and popular post-2000 icons of music. Spears is one of the few young musicians to appear on lists of best selling music acts of all-time. She also holds several world records.

She has officially released eight studio albums to date:""...Baby One More Time"" (1999), ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" (2000), ""Britney"" (2001), ""In the Zone"" (2003), ""Blackout"" (2007), ""Circus"" (2008), ""Femme Fatale"" (2011), ""Britney Jean""(2013).

Along with 2 official compilation albums, 2 official remixes albums and 1 official extended play: ""Greatest Hits: My Prerogative"" (2004), ""B In The Mix: The Remixes"" (2005), ""Britney & Kevin: Chaotic"" (2005), ""The Singles Collection"" (2009) and  ""B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2"" (2011).

As a child, Spears performed as a cast member of The New Mickey Mouse Club from 1993 to 1994, along with Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera.

In September 2004, she married Kevin Federline. The couple had two sons, Sean (born September 2005) and Jayden (born September 2006). Spears filed for divorce in November 2006.

Britney's debut album' ...Baby One More Time' was a huge commercial success. It debuted at number one in the U.S. with 120,500 copies sold in its first week on the Billboard 200, where it remained for 6 non-consecutive weeks, and it also debuted at number one in Canada, and reached the top ten in many other countries. The record has been certified 14× Platinum in the United States. It is the highest selling album by a teenager both in the US and worldwide. The album also spent fifty-one weeks in the top ten of the U.S. Billboard 200 and sixty weeks in the top twenty. With this, it became the second best-selling album of 1999, selling 8,358,619 in the United States, only behind Backstreet Boys' 'Millennium'. It stayed on the Billboard 200 for two years until it was moved to the Pop Catalog chart.  According to the RIAA, it is the 27th best-selling album in American music history, and 4th best-selling album by a female artist. This album, its lyrics, and its music videos maintained the typical virgin image of the late 1990s teen pop revival for Spears.

Following the success of her debut album, Spears released the album 'Oops!... I Did It Again' in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the U.S. by selling 1,319,193 units during its first week of sales, breaking the SoundScan record for the highest album sales in its debut week by any solo artist. The RIAA awarded the album with a diamond certification with 10 million copies sold in the U.S.

Spears released her third studio album 'Britney' in November 2001. Although not as successful as her previous albums, she assumed some creative control by co-writing five of the album's tracks. It surpassed Michael Jackson's album 'Invincible' when it had a successful debut at number one in the U.S. by selling 745,744 units during its first week.  The album's success made her the only female artist in music history to have her first three albums debut at number one.

Britney also became a Pepsi spokesperson in 2001, earning a $7-8 million endorsement deal. For the ""We Will Rock You"" Pepsi campaign, featuring Pink, Beyonce and Enrique Iglesias, Britney received $9.27 million. 

2002 found Britney in her first movie role, the somewhat biographical Crossroads.  

Spears released her fourth studio album 'In the Zone' in November 2003, jettisoning the Max Martin-produced synthpop of her earlier releases. The album took in lesser-known producers such as RedZone and big names including Moby and R. Kelly. Spears co-wrote eight of the album's thirteen songs and co-produced several pieces of her material for the first time. 'In the Zone' reached number one in the U.S. charts during its debut week, selling over 609,000 copies. This made Spears the first female in the Nielsen SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.  All three singles, Me Against The Music, Toxic and Everytime, reached #1 on the Australian ARIA charts.  'Toxic' became one of Britney's signature songs and the video is considered by most to be her best.

In July 2004, Spears became engaged to back-up dancer Kevin Federline.  She and Federline were married on September 18 that same year.  She also released a fragrance in September 2004, entitled Curious, and another, Fantasy, the following year. In early 2006, she released the limited edition fragrance In Control Curious.  She released two more fragrances in 2007 and 2009 : Believe and Hidden Fantasy.

November 2004 saw the release of her first greatest hits collection, 'Greatest Hits: My Prerogative', which features all of Spears's singles up to 'Outrageous' with the exception of ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"". It also featured three previously unreleased songs, a cover version of American R&B singer Bobby Brown's 1988 hit ""My Prerogative"", ""Do Somethin'"", produced by Bloodshy and Avant, whom she had worked with on In The Zone, and ""I've Just Begun (Havin' My Fun)"", which was a song recorded for Spears's fourth album, In The Zone, but did not make the final cut. By the end of that year, Spears had become one of the best-selling artists in the world.

Spears and her now husband Kevin, starred in their own reality television show, Britney and Kevin: Chaotic in the first half of 2005. In the final episode of the show, Spears debuted the single Someday (I Will Understand) but the song and video were not released in the US. 'Britney & Kevin: Chaotic...' the bonus CD, includes Mona Lisa and Over To You Now. 

In November 2005, Spears released her first remix album, B In The Mix: The Remixes. The songs ranged from  ""...Baby One More Time"" to ""Toxic"". Her newest single ""Someday (I Will Understand)"" was also remixed.  Another single, ""And Then We Kiss"", was only released in Asia, where it charted in many countries. The song peaked at number 15 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart despite it not being officially released in the U.S.  It also peaked at #13 on Australia's Hot 30 Countdown despite not being officially released.

In 2005, she won her first Grammy award for 'Best Dance Recording' for her song ""Toxic"".  On September 14, 2005, Spears gave birth to her first child, a boy, named Sean Preston.  

She appeared as a guest on Will and Grace in 2006. During an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman in May 2006, she announced that she was expecting once again.  On September 12, 2006 Spears gave birth to her second child, a son named Jayden James. 
 
On November 6, 2006 Spears filed for divorce from husband Kevin Federline. The divorce was finalized on July 30, 2007.  During 2007,  Britney continually lost more and more custody of her children, until her mental breakdown, which resulted in her taking Jayden hostage in a bathroom for over three hours, in Jan 08 stripped her of any visitations whatsoever for over a month.  Visitations after the month were heavily monitored.

On October 30, 2007 Spears released her 5th studio album entitled ""Blackout"" with its first single ""Gimme More"" being performed at the MTV Video Music Awards.  ""Gimme More was Britney's most successful single on the Billboard Hot 100 by peak position since ""...Baby One More Time"". The next two singles from ""Blackout"" were 'Piece of Me' and 'Break The Ice'.   Britney did minimal promotion for the album and it's singles.   For Gimme More, she filmed a music video and performed at the 2007 VMAs.  For Piece of Me, she filmed a music video.  For Break The Ice, an animated video was made.

On September 7, 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards for the third time. Although having not performed, a skit with Jonah Hill was pre-taped, as well as an introduction speech to the official opening of the show. Spears won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video Of The Year for ""Piece of Me"".

On September 15, Jive released a statement announcing the title of her sixth studio album, Circus, as well as the first single, Womanizer. The single was released to radio stations on September 26, and the release date for the album was December 2, Spears' 27th birthday.  The album was released in Australia on the 29th of November and in various European countries on the 27th.  Britney heavily promoted the album with various performances around the world, a documentary on her life since recovering from her breakdown and an upcoming world tour.

MTV signed a deal with Spears and Jive records to release a documentary titled 'For the Record', which aired on November 30, 2008, two days before the release of Circus.  The documentary was shot over three months and featured Britney discussing her personal life as well as her career. 

Circus debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 selling 505,000 copies in its first week. This became Spears' fifth number one album, making her the only act in Nielsen SoundScan history to have four albums debuted with 500,000 copies or more.  It is also Spears' second album, the first being ...'Baby One More Time', to have charted two top-ten singles as ""Circus"", the follow up single to the number-one hit ""Womanizer"", debuted at number three on the Hot 100, making it her highest debut on the chart as well as her seventh top ten hit.

Womanizer was her first #1 track on the ""Billboard Hot 100"" since ...Baby One More Time and made a new digital download record beating Touch My Body.  It also held the record for biggest jump, going from #96 to #1.  Kelly Clarkson has since beaten that record.

In March, Spears launched her seventh tour to promote her Circus album.  The Circus Starring: Britney Spears began its run on March 3, 2009 in Spears's home state of Louisiana.  Opening night, as well as every following show in North America, sold out.  The tour spans through North America (two legs), Europe, and Australia (first time touring ever).  Britney is accompanied by her children on the tour, and they are in her custody for over 50% of the time for the duration of the tour while ex-husband Kevin trails her.  

In April 2009, Spears declared her support for same-sex marriage to the media, following the controversial incident on Miss USA where contestant Carrie Prejean, representing California, expressed her disapproval of same-sex unions. The message left by Spears on her Twitter page read “Love is love! People should be able to do whatever makes them happy!”  After years of absence, Forbes magazine listed Spears as the 13th most powerful celebrity and the second most top-earning young musician as she made $35 million from June 2008 to June 2009. 

In July 2009, Spears confirmed through her Twitter that she has begun recording new material, stating that she was going into the studio with producer Max Martin.  Also producer and remixer Russ Castella posted a message on Twitter stating that he is working on a track titled ""Dirty Girl"" for Spears.  Castella also announced that the track he is working on would be released later in 2009.  

In September 2009, Britney won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video for Womanizer.

In October of 2009, Spears released the song ""3"" to iTunes. It stayed at #1 on their charts for thirteen days and debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. It was the first song to do so in three years and the first song by a non-American Idol singer to have a song debut at  #1 in eleven years.

In November 2009, Spears completed the Circus Starring: Britney Spears tour. Whilst there was controversy caused by her lip-synching to her shows, other reviews and ticket sales still were strong.

In March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale. Max Martin and Dr. Luke executive produced the album and the album's first single ""Hold It Against Me"". The single debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. This gave Spears her fourth number-one single on the chart, and made her only the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number-one, after Mariah Carey. The album peaked at number one in the United States (selling 276,000 copies), Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. The album's peak in the United States ties Britney with  Mariah Carey and  Janet Jackson  for the third-most number ones among women. Femme Fatale has sold over 590,000 copies in the United States and has been certified platinum by the RIAA. The album received positive critical reviews after its release, receiving a score of 67 on Metacritic, her highest critical score since Oops!... I Did It Again, with many critics naming the album one of Spears's best. In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix to the song ""S&M"" by Rihanna after Rihanna asked her fans via Twitter who they wanted her to collaborate with. The song reached number one in the US in mid-April 2011, giving Britney her fifth number one on the chart. In early May, Spears' second single from Femme Fatale, ""Till The World Ends"", reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and had ninety-eight million audience impressions on the Billboard chart, granting Spears the highest weekly audience of her 13-year chart career. Femme Fatale's third single ""I Wanna Go"" reached the top forty on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 2011. Among females in the last thirteen years, Spears now has the third-most top forty hits, with twenty-one. In August, the single managed to reach the top-ten on the Billboard Hot 100, which is the first time for Spears to have three songs from one album in the top-ten. On the week ending September 24, 2011, ""I Wanna Go"" moved 2-1 on the mainstream top 40, becoming her sixth number-one on that chart (making her tied for third all-time) and her first number-one and third top-ten pop song for Femme Fatale. Spears now has the longest span of number ones on the mainstream top 40, with a length of twelve years, seven months, and four days.

On March 2011, Spears announced that she would tour throughout the United States during summer 2011. The Femme Fatale Tour opened June 16 at the Power Balance Pavilion in Sacramento, California to positive reviews. Many critics noted that Spears sang more of the concert live in response to lip-synching accusations during The Circus Starring Britney Spears, and that the dancing is some of her best in years. The first ten US dates of the tour grossed $6.2 million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year. The tour travelled to Europe and South and Central America later in 2011. On August 12, Spears announced that her performances at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto will be taped to air on the EPIX television channel and for a DVD release, resulting in the doubling of traffic to EPIX social sites and 'Britney Spears' becoming a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Her first televised concert since the Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004, the show, Britney Spears: Femme Fatale, was shot in 2D and 3D on August 13 and 14 and will premiere on Epix in November. It has since been released to DVD and Blu-Ray. There is a Target Exclusive version of the DVD, which includes a Bonus CD with 3 remixes of HIAM, 3 remixes of TTWE, 3 remixes of IWG, and exclusive track titled Scary (which before this release was only available on the Japanese Deluxe Edition and the Premium Fan Edition of Femme Fatale). On the Blu-ray, the 4 music videos from Femme Fatale appear on it exclusively. 

The tour ended on December 10, 2011 in Puerto Rico after 79 performances. In August 2011, Spears received the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. The next month, she released her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2. In December, Spears became engaged to her long-time boyfriend Jason Trawick, who had formerly been her agent. Trawick became a co-conservator of Spears, alongside her father, in April 2012.In January 2013, Spears and Trawick ended their engagement. Trawick was also removed as Spears's co-conservator, restoring her father as the sole conservator.

In May 2012, Spears was hired to replace Nicole Scherzinger as a judge for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, joining Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid and fellow new judge Demi Lovato, who replaced Paula Abdul. With a reported salary of $15 million, she became the highest-paid judge on a singing competition series in television history. She mentored the Teens category; her final act, Carly Rose Sonenclar, was named the runner-up of the season. Spears did not return for the show's third season and her spot was filled by Kelly Rowland. Spears was featured on will.i.am's ""Scream & Shout"", which was released as a single from his fourth studio album, #willpower (2013). The song later became Spears's sixth number one single on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at #3 on US Billboard Hot 100. In December, Forbes magazine named her music's top-earning woman of 2012, with estimated earnings of $58 million.

Spears began work on her eighth studio album in December 2012, and enlisted will.i.am as its executive producer in May 2013.

Beck,"The Artist name Beck can refer to two artists;

1) Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell, July 8, 1970) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist.  Beck's music is known for its pop-junk culture collage of musical styles, ironic lyrics, samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and heady sound effects.

Beck was born in Los Angeles, California, to David Campbell (a musician and son of a Presbyterian minister) and Bibbe Hansen (a former dancer for The Velvet Underground, founding member of the satirical band Black Fag, and visual artist). When his parents separated, Beck stayed with his mother and brother in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by that city's diverse musical offerings—everything from hip-hop to latin music—and his mother's art scene – all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published work.

Although Beck's work defies easy description, his eclecticism and genre experiments have sparked comparisons with Prince, though Beck was undoubtedly a less prolific artist, and drew on an absurdist, free-flowing lyrical style totally original when first exposed to mainstream audiences (indeed, some critics labeled him and his breakthrough single Loser as novelties - see below). Despite this individualism, Beck's music was very much a product of the 90s and the media age in general, with hip hop, indie/underground rock, electronic music and genre-benders like the Beastie Boys as notable touchstones; in addition, some critics could not resist likening his head-spinning lyrical aesthetic to a post-modern Bob Dylan sensibility.

After dropping out of high school in the mid-1980s, Beck educated himself and traveled widely. In Germany, he spent time with his grandfather, fluxus artist Al Hansen. His artistic relationship with his grandfather may have influenced both his album art and sense of musical collage. He began the musical activity in 1988. The late-80's found him in New York City as part of the punk-influenced anti-folk music movement.

Beck returned to Los Angeles at the turn of the decade, destitute but motivated. During this time, Beck sought out (or snuck onto) stages at venues all over Los Angeles, from punk clubs to coffee shops. Some of his earliest and most thought-provoking recordings were achieved by working with Tom Grimley at Poop Alley Studios, a part of WIN Records.

In this atmosphere of heady creativity the founders of Bong Load Custom Records discovered Beck. Their 1993 12"" vinyl Loser, from an initial run of 530 copies, created a sensation on college and alternative radio that led to a furious bidding war between labels to sign Beck. Eventually, he chose Geffen Records, who offered him terms that included an allowance for the release of independent albums while under contract (he may have owed Bong Load another album or two).

In 1994, Geffen's official debut release of Mellow Gold made Beck a mainstream smash success; it also led to his iconic status as the ""slacker"" representative of the alternative rock scene, although the title of the song had been ironic.

At the same time, he released Stereopathetic Soulmanure on Flipside Records and One Foot in the Grave on independent K Records. Beck took his act on the road with the 1995 Lollapalooza tour. Still, some critics panned him as a one-hit wonder. Audiences' (especially at Lollapalooza) familiarity with Loser only, and their general disinterest in his other work only reinforced his image as a one-hit wonder.  It's been said said that Beck released Stereopathetic Soulmanure and One Foot in the Grave to shake the Gen X-ers that associated themselves with him and made ""Loser"" their slacker anthem.  

The one-hit wonder label was put to rest with the release of 1996's Odelay, a collaborative effort with The Dust Brothers, producers of Paul's Boutique. The lead single, ""Where It's At"", received heavy airplay and its video was in constant rotation on MTV. Within the year, Odelay had received perfect reviews in Rolling Stone and Spin magazines, having been listed on countless ""Best of"" lists (it topped the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 'Album of the Year'), receiving double-platinum status, and earning an impressive number of industry awards, including two Grammys.

Odelay was followed in 1998 by Mutations. Produced by Nigel Godrich of Radiohead fame, it was intended as a stopgap measure before the next album proper. Recorded over two weeks, during which Beck recorded one song a day, the sessions produced 14 songs. Mutations was a departure from the electronic density of Odelay, and was filled with folk and blues influences. Songs on the album consisted of older tracks, some even dating back as far as 1994.

In 1999, Geffen released the much-anticipated Midnite Vultures, an orgy of sexual and culinary innuendo supported by a world tour. For Beck, it was a return to the high-energy performances that had been his trademark as far back as Lollapalooza. 

After Midnite Vultures came Sea Change in 2002, another airy and emotional album with producer Nigel Godrich, which became Beck's first U.S. Top 10 album, reaching # 8.  Sea Change was conceptualized as an album with one unifying theme—the stages following the end of a relationship. The album also featured string arrangements by Beck's father and a sonically dense mix reminiscient of Mutations. The Sea Change tour featured The Flaming Lips as Beck's opening and backing band.

In September 2003, Beck returned to the studio to work on his sixth major-label album. Guero was produced by the Dust Brothers and Tony Hoffer and features a collaboration with Jack White of The White Stripes; it marked a return to Odelay-era sound. The album was released in March of 2005 and despite critical acclaim, the album received a more lackluster response from Beck's indie-oriented fanbase.

Beck married Marissa Ribisi in April 2004, shortly before the birth of their son, Cosimo Henri Hansen.  2004 also saw the release of ""10 Years of Mellow Gold,"" a short documentary about Beck's first album.

Beck's next album, The Information was released on October 3, 2006. It is a largely electronic and ambient, filled with blips and beeps. It was produced by Nigel Godrich, who worked on ""Sea Change"" and a longtime Radiohead and Thom Yorke producer. The first single was Nausea, an acoustic rock hip hop song. The next single was Cellphone's Dead, and the third single was Think I'm In Love.

His next single, Timebomb, was released on iTunes on August 21, 2007, and the limited edition vinyl 12"" was released on November 2, 2007, with an instrumental version of the song on the B-side. In December, 2007, it was announced that Timebomb had been nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. 

Modern Guilt was the eighth studio album by Beck. It was released on July 8, 2008. The album fulfilled Beck's recording contract with Interscope Records. Outside of North America, the record was released by XL Recordings. Its three singles were Chemtrails, Gamma Ray, and Youthless.

Modern Guilt features two contributions by Cat Power and was produced by Beck and Danger Mouse.

The album entered both the Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart at number four, and gave Beck his first ever Top 10 placing on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number nine. The album has also been Beck's best charting album in Australia, reaching 13. It sold 84,000 copies in its first week. Although successful, this does not match the first week sales of The Information, which were 99,000. In December 2008, Modern Guilt was nominated for Best Alternative Album at the 51st Grammy Awards.

Song Reader, a project Beck released in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, in the hopes that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.

In the summer of 2013, Beck was reported to be working on two new studio albums: one a more self-contained acoustic disc in the vein of One Foot in the Grave and another described as a ""proper follow-up"" to Modern Guilt. Beck expects to release both albums independently. He released two standalone singles over the course of the summer: the electro ballad Defriended and the chorus-heavy I Won't Be Long. A third single, Gimme, appeared on September 17.

In October 2013, it was announced that Beck signed to Capitol Records. Beck released his twelfth studio album entitled Morning Phase on 21 February 2014. For the recording of Morning Phase, Beck reunited with many of the same musicians with whom he had worked on the critically acclaimed 2002 album Sea Change. On January 20, 2014, the album's first single Blue Moon was released. Beck released the second single, Waking Light, on February 4, 2014


2) BECK can refer to a fictional rock band from the Japanese Anime series BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad. The fictional BECK's songs feature in the BECK Original Sound Track. BECK's style and members are highly influenced by various different artists. From vocals in the style of Zack De La Rocha from Rage Against the Machine, guitar influenced by Tom Morello of the same band, the band is highly influenced by rap-rock.

As the series develops, other influence appear, including guitar in the style of Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, and Red Hot Chili Peppers John Frusciante. During the series, the band covers a famous The Beatles song, 'I've got a Feeling'. The name BECK could have possibly been influenced by the first artist Beck, mentioned above. Harold Sakushi, the original author of the series, has confirmed that BECK is generally based around the Red Hot Chili Peppers, being his favourite band. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Beck"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Katy Perry,"Katy Perry (born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson on 25 October 1984) is a singer/songwriter from Santa Barbara, California, United States. Since the release of her 2007 debut single ""Ur So Gay"", Perry has released two albums - 2008's ""One of the Boys"" and 2010's ""Teenage Dream"" - and has had six Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit singles.

Under the name Katy Hudson, she released a self-titled gospel album in 2001, which was unsuccessful. She later recorded an album with production team The Matrix and completed the majority of a solo album from 2004–05, the later of which was never released. After signing with Capitol Music Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry and released her first Internet single ""Ur So Gay"" that November, which garnered public attention but failed to chart. She rose to fame with the release of her second single ""I Kissed a Girl"" in 2008, which went on to top international charts. Perry's first mainstream studio album One of the Boys followed later that year and subsequently became the 33rd-best selling album worldwide of 2008. It was accredited platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America, while ""I Kissed a Girl"" and her second single ""Hot n Cold"" both received multi-platinum certifications.

Her second studio album Teenage Dream was released in August 2010 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album includes five Billboard chart-toppers ""California Gurls"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Firework"", and ""E.T."" and ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"", making Teenage Dream only the second album - after Michael Jackson's Bad - to have five songs reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. With ""E.T."" at number one on the chart of May 12, 2011, Perry became the first artist in history to spend 52 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.

Perry was credited as a guest judge on the seventh series of British television show The X Factor, has released a fragrance called ""Purr"", and voices Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs. Perry had a long relationship with Travie McCoy; she married Russell Brand on October 23, 2010. After 14 months of marriage, Brand filed for divorce from Perry on December 30, 2011, in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce became effective in July 2012.

Prism is the fourth studio album by Perry. The album was released on October 18, 2013. Prism topped the US album charts with first week sales of 286,000 becoming Perry's best opening week to date.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Arcade Fire,"Arcade Fire is an indie rock band, perhaps most famous  for their third studio album, The Suburbs, released in 2010 to critical acclaim and commercial success. They formed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2001. The band consists of Win Butler (vocals, guitar, piano), Régine Chassagne (vocals, accordion, keyboards, hurdy gurdy, drums), Richard Reed Parry (bass, guitar), William Butler (keyboards, guitar), Tim Kingsbury (bass), and Jeremy Gara (drums). Montreal percussionist Dane Mills performed on the EP and in early live shows.  As of May 2005, the touring band includes horn players and violinists.

The band’s trademark fashion consists in wearing rather formal attire during live events and a use of orchestral instruments. When asked about the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: ""It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that someone told me. It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it's probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him."" Win Butler and his brother Will grew up in Texas.

Band formation

Arcade Fire formed around the husband and wife duo of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne. Joining together as recently as mid-2003, the current line-up solidified in late 2003/early 2004, when their first full-length album Funeral was recorded. Before this an eponymous EP (often referred to by fans as the Us Kids Know EP) had been sold at early shows. The EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release once the band started becoming more prominent. Arcade Fire are known for their enthralling live performances, as well as its use of a large number of musical instruments. In addition to mainstays guitar, drums, and bass guitar, members play piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, keyboard, French horn, accordion, and harp. With several able musicians, the band take most of their instrumental diversity on tour and members switch instrumental duties throughout their shows. The number of instruments, along with a wide set of musical influences has provided a substantial number of resources on which to draw from during the recording process. The promise showed by the band in its live shows allowed it to land a record contract with Chapel Hill-based independent record label Merge Records.

Funeral

Without a major label backing, the success of the band and the album Funeral has been acclaimed as an Internet phenomenon. After a 9.7 rating from Pitchfork, Merge Records sold out their inventory of Funeral and it became the label's first album in the Billboard 200 chart. An early tip from David Bowie was also influential. The band booked small clubs for their 2004 tour but growing interest forced many venue changes, far beyond the band's expectations, and continued internationally into mid-2005. The MTV2 2005 Review hosted by Zane Lowe named Funeral Album of the Year, and NME named Funeral Number 2 in their list of 2005's best albums and ""Rebellion (Lies)"" the best track. By November 2005, Funeral had gone gold in both Canada and the UK and sold in excess of half a million copies worldwide, a phenomenal number for an independent release with minimal television or radio exposure. It has also surpassed Neutral Milk Hotel's In The Aeroplane Over The Sea as the biggest selling Merge Records album to date.

Arcade Fire were featured on the April 4, 2005 cover of Time Magazine's Canadian edition, and hailed as a band who ""helped put Canadian music on the world map"". On April 2, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, they received the Juno Award for Songwriters Of The Year for three songs from Funeral: ""Wake Up"", ""Rebellion (Lies)"" and ""Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)"". Arcade Fire then planned to begin recording a follow up to Funeral in the winter of 2005-2006, having bought an old church forty minutes from central Montreal which they converted into a studio. 

Neon Bible

In mid-December 2006 www.neonbible.com went live containing nothing more than a phone number, 1-866-NEONBIBLE where people can listen to a new track called Intervention. Built in the style of customer support lines, the number has other features including a contest and a chance to talk to a live person at a specific time each week. 

Then in January 2007, they finally announced that the new album Neon Bible would be released March 5th in UK, March 6th in US. The announcement was made with a video in the album's website, with guitarist Richard Reed Parry using a gramophone and a paper mask of Parry's own face, and sitting on Win Butler´s chair. After the announcement of the album´s release, the website was updated with a streaming version of ""Black Mirror"", new art and a few phone messages sounding like the band´s members.

The Suburbs

The band released their third album ""The Suburbs"" on August 2, 2010 in the UK and August 3, 2010 in the United States. It debuted at #1 in both countries. On February 13, 2011, the album won Album of the Year at the 53rd Grammy Awards.

Arcade Fire recorded a song for The Hunger Games soundtrack (The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond), called ""Abraham's Daughter"". The song is featured in the movie's end credits. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200. It sold more than 175,000 copies in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It's the first theatrical film soundtrack to top the chart since Michael Jackson's ""This Is It"" debuted at No. 1 on the list. It is also only the 16th soundtrack to debut at No. 1 in the history of the Billboard 200 chart (those soundtracks include film, television, and straight-to-video efforts).

Reflektor

Arcade Fire and Mercury Records confirmed that they would release a fourth album in late 2013. In December 2012, the band's manager Scott Rodger confirmed that Arcade Fire was in the studio working with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. The official Arcade Fire pre-order website sets the release date on October 28, 2013. The band announced on January 18, 2013 that they were selling the church they had been using as a studio due to a collapsed roof. Throughout 2013, the band worked on the album in several different recording studios - including Murphy's DFA Records studio in New York. On June 22, 2013, Rolling Stone reported that new material from the album would be released on September 9, 2013. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Arcade+Fire"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

U2,"U2 is rock band from Ireland which formed in 1976 in Dublin, Ireland. Since the band’s formation, they have consisted of Bono (real name Paul Hewson) (vocals, guitar, harmonica), The Edge (real name David Evans) (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass) and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums, percussion). The band is the biggest selling alternative rock act of all time, having sold 150 million albums worldwide as of 2008. They have won 22 Grammys and were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. As of 2009, they have released 12 albums and 58 singles.

Foundation: The band originally formed in 1976 when Larry Mullen posted a bulletin in his school asking for musicians to form a rock band. The band then consisted of the four current members plus three additional guitarists, including The Edge’s brother Dick Evans (later a member of Virgin Prunes), Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin. According to legend, Bono originally auditioned as a guitarist but couldn’t play. He auditioned as lead vocals, but really couldn’t sing. He was, however, incredibly enthusiastic about the band, extremely charismatic, a great writer, and was strangely able to reach the audience when the band played, something he is known for still today. Bono will reach out into the crowd and dance or mess with someone in the crowd at every concert. He was kept as a member. The extra guitarists would soon leave the band and the group would go through the names “Feedback ” and “The Hype” before finally settling on U2.

The 70s & 80s: 1978 was a jumping point year for the band, finally finding their sound / voice. U2 won a talent contest in 1978: £500 and funds to make a record. Paul McGuinness became the band’s manager and U2 released an EP called Three and the single Another Day, the following year. U2 went on to release their first album, Boy and then more critically acclaimed albums incl.: October, War, Under A Blood Red Sky, and The Unforgettable Fire (featuring the song PlayMLK dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr). Seen by many as a political band with more charisma than others, they were called “a different kind” of band. After a short break U2 returned with The Joshua Tree & the USA music inspired Rattle And Hum (also a movie of the same name, based on the tour).

The 90s: Promising ”to dream it all up again”, they added industrial and dance styles to their music. Trying to drop a goody two shoes image, they went to Berlin (Germany), supposedly to develop new self-expressions. From there they started to make fun of themselves and had a good time of it in albums like Achtung Baby (meaning ”watch out, baby”, artwork feat. make-up artist Nassim Khalifa) & Zooropa. Bono took on many stage personae such as “The Fly”, “Mirrorball Man” and “Mr. MacPhisto” for the gigantic ZOO TV Tour. Later they continued to make fun of Pop culture and all its extremes with the album Pop and consequent PopMart tour which was announced to be launched at a Kmart store and included a giant golden arch across the stage.

The 00s: At the end of the 90’s into 00’s U2 became less image and more reality. With the death of Bono’s good friend Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of INXS, Bono wrote more songs from the heart surrounding ideas like life and death, children, hope, and the real world past all the pop culture and TV. Some say they’ve returned to a more band-centric sound with albums like All That You Can’t Leave Behind which features a song, Kite, dedicated to Bono’s father who passed away shortly after the album’s conception and 2004’s How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.

The 10s: U2 went on the  U2 360° Tour in 2009 and 2010. This tour set records for the highest-grossing concert tour. The group is currently working on an upcoming album produced by Danger Mouse.

The Name: There are many theories as to the origin of the name U2. For example, U2 was an intelligence airplane that was in use by the United States during the Cold War. Other obvious candidates include “You too” and “You two”, etc. Nonetheless the official line on the name’s origins remains unknown. The band has been quoted as saying that they did think of the U2 spy plane, but remain hushed about other reasons… U2

R.E.M.,"R.E.M. were an alternative rock band formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1980. The band originally consisted of Michael Stipe (vocals), Peter Buck (guitar, mandolin), Mike Mills (bass, keyboards, vocals) and  Bill Berry (drums, vocals). Berry retired from the band in October 1997 after having suffered a brain aneurysm in 1995.

R.E.M. released its first single, "" Radio Free Europe "", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone . The single was followed by the  Chronic Town EP  in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album,  Murmur , and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single ""The One I Love "". The group signed to Warner Bros.  in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.

By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums,  Out of Time  (1991) and  Automatic for the People  (1992), which veered from the band's established sound. R.E.M.'s 1994 release,  Monster , was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a three-piece. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

On 21 September 2011, after over 30 years together, R.E.M. announced that they had split up.

AC/DC,"AC/DC is an Australian rock band formed in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in December 1973 by Angus and Malcolm Young. Their albums have sold in colossal numbers; the total is now estimated at well over 200 million copies worldwide, with the 1980 album Back In Black selling over 21 million in the US alone and 40+ million worldwide, making it, according to statistics, one of the best selling albums in the world, outsold only by Michael Jackson's 'Thriller', and tied with Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon'. Their newest album released in 2008 entitled Black Ice is critically acclaimed even ahead of its release. The band has had two distinctive lead singers, and fans tend to divide its history into the ""Bon Scott era (1974-80)"" and the ""Brian Johnson era (1980-present)"".

Most fans will agree that lead guitarist Angus Young (Now living In The Netherlands) is the face of AC/DC, appearing on the cover of most albums. His wild stage antics and schoolboy uniform have made him one of the most loved guitar players of all time. He has the unparalleled ability to captivate an audience of over 50,000 people with just the sounds of his guitar and his facial expressions. Most footage of Angus consists of him either doing Chuck Berry's patented Duck Walk across the stage, or of his mop of hair flying around as he rocks through one of his famous solos. Aside from captivating solos, he has also created some of the most well-known riffs together with his brother Malcolm Young.

Bon Scott was the second man to front AC/DC back in 1973( Dave Evans was the first). He would always smile when he was singing and often made a sideways glance towards a camera if it was there with a grin on his face. Also known for wearing a School Girl outfit with pigtails and smoking a cigarette on their first TV performance, with his duties as lead vocalist, Scott also helped to write many of the band's most popular songs. He was lyrically at his best on such songs as ""Let There Be Rock"" and ""Shot Down in Flames"". Sadly, Bon died February 19th 1980 due to alcohol poisoning after a night of heavy drinking in London. It was around this time that AC/DC were starting to get global recognition.

The rhythm section of AC/DC includes Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar), Cliff Williams (bass) and Phil Rudd (drums). Other drummers include Simon Wright ('83-'89) and Chris Slade ('89-'94).

Brian Johnson (earlier in English Heavy rock band Geordie) became the new front man of AC/DC in early 1980 after Bon Scott passed away. Brian is known for always wearing his paperboy cap, a black tank top and blue jeans. He is noted for his distinctive, rough and jagged, yet powerful falsetto style of singing, with a remarkably high range. Well known examples for Johnson's characteristic vocals are found in the songs ""For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)"" and ""You Shook Me All Night Long"". With blessings from the Scott family, Brian has been singing his way into fans' hearts for over 25 years.

AC/DC are currently on tour as of this writing. You can view the tour schedule at the Official AC/DC Website.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Martin Garrix,"The new wave of fresh-outta-highschool EDM talent is led by just a handful of pioneers. Martin Garrix can certainly be counted as one of them. Currently being 18 years old, he is recognized as one of the most talented guys out there. He just landed his first record deal and has already been spotted in de studio with Sidney Samson and that other Dutch mega talent Julian Jordan.
His first official release 'Keygen' received great DJ support and ranked high in the Beatport charts and his remix of Roy Gates' 'Midnight Sun' flew up Beatport's Progressive House chart.
In the DJ department Martin is quite the busy one too. He's had gigs at Mysteryland and was the youngest DJ ever to play the world’s largest nightclub Privilege in Ibiza. He's a regular guest at LMFAO's 'Dont Let Daddy Know' parties and Redfoo's 'Sorry For Party Rocking' club nights, where he shared the booth with Sidney Samson, Eva Simmons, Diplo and many more.
Martin Garrix is very well on the way to becoming hot EDM property, so keep your eyes and ears peeled!

Pixies,"Pixies are an American alternative rock band which formed in Boston, Massachusetts, United States in 1986. The band consists of Charles (Black Francis) Thompson IV (vocals, guitar; also known as ''Frank Black''), Joey Santiago (lead guitar),   David Lovering (drums) and Paz Lenchantin (bass, vocals). Until 2013, the band also featured  Kim Deal on bass and vocals. The band officially split in 1993  and reunited in 2004. They went on hiatus in 2007, with each band member pursuing projects of their own, only to reunite in 2009, with the announcement of a new tour commencing in Europe that summer.

Although quite popular on alternative rock radio in the United States due to heavy airplay of the singles ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" and ""Here Comes Your Man"", they were never widely popular there, but found success in Europe, especially in the UK (where they managed three top 40 singles ""Velouria"", ""Planet of Sound"" and a re-release of ""Debaser"") and Belgium and the Netherlands, where they were heavily broadcasted by alternative public radio. 

The band's style of alternative rock music is heavily influenced by punk and surf rock, and while highly melodic, is capable of being tremendously abrasive at the same time. Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer and has a distinctly desperate, yowling delivery. He has typically written cryptic songs about offbeat subjects, such as UFOs and surrealism. References to mental instability, violent Biblical imagery, and physical injury feature in many of the band's songs.

The group is frequently posited as the immediate forebear of the alternative rock boom of the 1990s, though they disbanded before reaping any of the benefits this might have brought them. Avowed fan Kurt Cobain's acknowledgement of the debt Nirvana owed to the Pixies, along with similar tributes by other alternative bands, ensured that the Pixies' legacy and influence grew substantially in the years following their demise.

In 1993, during an interview with BBC Radio 5, Black Francis announced that the band had split - something he had not told his bandmates. After the interview, he called Santiago, who in turn faxed Deal and Lovering the news the next morning. After the split, Black Francis inverted his stage name to Frank Black and embarked on a successful solo career, while Deal resumed her role in The Breeders with her identical twin sister Kelley. In 2004, the band reunited for a tour - documented in the film loudQUIETloud - and released a new single, ""Bam Thwok"" that summer. In 2007, Black Francis (now going by that name again) stated in an interview that the reunion was ""done"" even though the members remain in good terms with each other. In later interviews however, he began to mention that he might be willing to record another Pixies album. Nonetheless, Francis has returned to his solo career and Deal to the Breeders, both of which released albums and toured in 2008. Lovering and Santiago, meanwhile, set up their own project, a band called Everybody.

In order to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of Doolittle, Pixies launched a tour in October 2009, on which they perform all the album's songs and B-sides. In the autumn of 2011 the ""Lost Cities"" tour continued the ""Doolittle Tour"" as they played many venues for the first time. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Pixies"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Korn,"Korn (stylized as KoЯn) is an American nu metal band from Bakersfield, California, formed in 1992. The current band line up includes five members: Jonathan Davis, James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, Brian Welch and Ray Luzier. The band was formed as an expansion of L.A.P.D. They have collaborated with musicians such as Chino Moreno from Deftones, Fred Durst from nu metal band Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, Tre Hardson from The Pharcyde, Skrillex and Nas.

The band released their first demo album, Neidermeyer's Mind, in 1993. Their debut album, Korn was released in 1994, where they featured the same musicians that had performed on Neidermeyer's Mind. The band began recording Life Is Peachy in April 1996, and released it on October 15, 1996. Follow the Leader is recognized as Korn's mainstream breakthrough, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1998, along with the following album, Issues in 1999. The band released Untouchables on June 11, 2002, and later released Take a Look in the Mirror on November 21, 2003, both peaking in the top ten of the Billboard 200. Their first compilation album, Greatest Hits Vol 1, peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. See You on the Other Side was released on December 6, 2005, and Korn's untitled album was released nearly two years later on July 31, 2007. Korn III: Remember Who You Are, the band's ninth studio album, was released July 13, 2010 via Roadrunner Records. In 2011, they released an album called The Path of Totality and with the album, they added sounds and instruments of dubstep with their nu metal sound.

The Get Up! Songfacts reports that Korn's 10th studio album, The Path Of Totality was produced by various dubstep, drum and bass, and electro house artists due to the band's desire to fuse their traditional sound with electronic elements. released on December 2, 2011 in Europe and December 6, 2011 in the US. Davis explained the album title: ""The title The Path of Totality refers to the fact that in order to see the sun in a full solar eclipse, you must be in the exact right place in the exact right time. That's how this album came together. I think all the producers feel the same way. I'm not sure it could ever happen again.""

Korn currently has over 36 singles, over 25 of which have charted. The band has over 5 video albums and over 34 music videos.

Korn has sold over 19 million albums in the US, and over 40 million worldwide. Ten of the band's official releases have peaked in the top ten of the Billboard 200, eight of which have peaked in the top five. Eight of those releases are certified Platinum by the RIAA, and one is certified Gold. Korn have also earned seven Grammy nominations — two of which they have won (for ""Freak on a Leash"" and ""Here to Stay"").

Korn say they will release a new album soon in 2013, saying it will be aggressive, heavy and having ""in your face!"" vocals and to sound like their roots. Brain Welch also says he will perform at some concerts with them in January 2013. He also says he will later on rejoin the band. But he left the band originally to rededicate his life back to Christianity. While David, left and opened a bar in Bakersfield, California.

They were the first band to be labeled as nu metal, people say they were starting the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Alongside this genre, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal, rap rock, alternative metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal with grunge and hip-hop. Their lyrics focus mostly on stuff like personal alienation, pain, social anger, issues, memories, personal views and thoughts and sometimes revenge. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world. The band, especially their frontman Jonathan have rejected the metal label. Although Munky said he never considered the band as nu metal. In their Issues album, they reduced slightly the rap sounds they had, but returned to it with Take a Look in the Mirror going back to their roots and being very aggressive, but with See You On the Other Side, they took influences from industrial metal but went back to the sound of Untouchables and Issues with their Untitled album. These are examples of their musical style and direction.

Massive Attack,"Massive Attack are a trip-hop group which formed in Bristol, England in 1988. The group currently consists of Robert ""3D"" Del Naja and Grant ""Daddy G"" Marshall. Third member Andy ""Mushroom"" Vowles left the group in 1999. The band has released five studio albums: ""Blue Lines"" (1991), ""Protection"" (1994), ""Mezzanine"" (1998), ""100th Window"" (2003), and ""Heligoland"" (2010). On 28 January 2016, Massive Attack released a new EP, Ritual Spirit, followed by The Spoils in July.

The group are considered to be progenitors of the trip hop genre. Their debut album, Blue Lines was released in 1991, with the single ""Unfinished Sympathy"" reaching the charts and later being voted the 10th greatest song of all time in a poll by The Guardian. 1998's Mezzanine, containing ""Teardrop"", and 2003's 100th Window charted in the UK at number 1. Both Blue Lines and Mezzanine feature in Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The group has won numerous music awards throughout their career, including a Brit Award—winning Best British Dance Act, two MTV Europe Music Awards, and two Q Awards They have released 5 studio albums that have sold over 11 million copies worldwide.

In the nineties, the trio became known for often not being able to easily get along with one another and working increasingly separately. Andy Vowles (Mushroom), who had once thought of himself as the trio's musical director, acrimoniously left Massive Attack in late 1999, after an ultimatum from the other two members to end the group immediately if he did not. Despite having taken Del Naja's side in the effective firing of Vowles and then participating in a show-of-unity webcast as a duo the following year, Grant Marshall (G) had also effectively left by 2001 in that he abandoned the studio altogether. Marshall returned to a studio role in 2005, having joined the touring line-up in 2003/4. The two later worked together again in the 2008 Damon Albarn sessions for the fifth proper studio album. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Massive+Attack"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Doors,"The Doors were an American rock band which formed in Los Angeles, California, United States in 1965. The band consisted of Jim Morrison (vocals), Ray Manzarek (organ), Robby Krieger (guitar) and John Densmore (drums). In this configuration, the band released six albums, all of which were successful and released two US #1 hit singles - 1967's ""Light My Fire"" and 1968's ""Hello, I Love You"".  After Morrison's death at his apartment at 17 Rue Beautraillis Paris in 1971, the band continued on as a trio, releasing two more albums that were ignored commercially and disliked critically before disbanding in 1973.

UCLA film school students Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek had known each other at college and met by chance on Venice beach in July 1965. Morrison told Manzarek he had been writing songs and, at Manzarek's encouragement, sang ""Moonlight Drive"". Manzarek immediately suggested they form a band.

Keyboardist Ray Manzarek was already in the band called Rick And The Ravens with Morrison and his brother Rick Manzarek while Robby Krieger and John Densmore were playing with The Psychedelic Rangers, and knew Manzarek from shared meditation instruction. In August Densmore joined the group and, along with members of the Ravens and an unidentified female bass player, recorded a six-song demo on September 2. This was widely bootlegged and appeared in full on the 1997 Doors box set.

That month the group recruited talented guitarist Robby Krieger and the final lineup—Morrison, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore—was complete. Manzarek solved their lack of bassist by playing bass on a Fender Rhodes bass keyboard with his left hand and keyboards with his right hand.

The band took their name from the title of a book by Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception, which was in turn borrowed from a line of poetry by the 18th century artist and poet William Blake: ""If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite.""

By 1966 the group was playing The London Fog club and soon graduated to the prestigious Whisky a Go Go. On August 10 they were spotted by Elektra Records president Jac Holzman on the insistence of Love singer Arthur Lee, whose group was on Elektra. On August 18 the group signed with the label. The timing was immaculate when, on August 21, the band was fired from the club after a profanity filled performance of ""The End"". In an incident that was a foretelling of the controversy that would follow the group, a tripping Morrison bellowed during the ""Oedipal"" section of the song ""Mother...I want to...fuck you!!!"".

Early recording: 1967–1969

After Jack Holzman and Paul Rothchild saw two sets of the band playing at Whiskey A Go Go, the first uneven, but the second mesmerizing, the band was signed to the Elektra Records label beginning a long and successful partnership with producer Paul Rothchild and engineer Bruce Botnick. Their self-titled debut LP featured most of the major songs from their set, including the eleven-minute musical drama, ""The End"". With the band at the peak of their form and bristling with energy and ambition, the album was recorded in only a few days, in late August and early September 1966, almost entirely live in the studio, with most songs captured in a single take. Morrison and Manzarek also directed an innovative promotional film for the single ""Break on Through"", which was an important stepping stone in the development of the music video genre.

Released in January 1967, the album caused a sensation in music circles and the second single released from it, ""Light My Fire"", became a major hit, establishing the group alongside Jefferson Airplane and The Grateful Dead as one of the top new American bands of 1967. It was released in April but did not hit the top, with the long middle solo cut out, until July. In September the group played the song live on the popular Ed Sullivan Show where Morrison sang the word ""higher"", despite being asked not to by the CBS Network. They also performed a new single ""People Are Strange"" which they repeated for DJ Murray The K's TV show on September 22. Earlier in the month the group recorded a dazzling version of ""The End"" for CBS in Toronto. It remained unreleased until the release of The Doors Soundstage Performances DVD.

With his saturnine good looks, magnetic stage presence and skin-tight leather trousers, Morrison quickly became one of the major pop sex symbols of his day, although he soon became frustrated with the strictures of stardom.

The second Doors LP, Strange Days, was almost as strong as the first, and it cemented the group's reputation. More subdued and less spontaneous than the debut, the album is notable for its evocative lyricism and atmosphere. Closing track ""When The Music's Over"" was again, like ""The End"" lengthy and dramatic and helped establish Morrison's reputation as the wild shaman of rock. Yet the album was also strongly commercial and featured well-known Doors songs, ""Love Me Two Times"" and ""Moonlight Drive"".

Morrison's status as a figure of rebellion was further cemented on December 9 when he was arrested in New Haven, Connecticut for badmouthing the police to the audience from the stage. Morrison said he had been maced by an overzealous cop after he was caught backstage with a girl. The group finished a successful year on December 27 by taping ""Light My Fire"" and ""Moonlight Drive"" for the Jonathan Winters Show. From December 26 to 28 the group played at The Winterland San Francisco and then two dates in Denver on December 30 and 31, capping off a year of almost constant touring.

As a result of their success, The Doors forfeited their status as Underground heroes. They allowed Sixteen magazine to portray them as teen idols and their ""spontaneous"" stage-show was exposed as not-so-spontaneous after all. An article by Jerry Hopkins in the February 10, 1968 edition of Rolling Stone typified the fall from grace:

""One shtick, or piece of stage-business, missing at the Shrine performance, was Morrison's carefully-executed 'accidental' fall from the stage into the crowd. For months this had been a part of the act. It got a lot of screams from the teenyboppers. Then a review appeared in a local newspaper which called the fall one of the phoniest things ever. Morrison was asked if he'd read the article. 'Yeah,' said Morrison, 'and I guess he's right.' Morrison did not take the fall that night at the Shrine.""

Fraught sessions for the group's third album took place in April as Morrison became increasingly dependent on alcohol. Approaching the height of their popularity The Doors played a series of outdoor shows which led to frenzied scenes between fans and police, particularly at Chicago Coliseum on May 10.

Their third LP, Waiting for the Sun, (1968) showed the band beginning to branch out from their initial form, as they exhausted their original repertoire and began writing new material. It became their first #1 LP and the single ""Hello, I Love You"" was their second and last US #1 single. The album is eclectic in style, sometimes inconsequential, and much less unified than the first two, despite containing some fine material. It further isolated them from the underground cognoscenti. As Lilian Roxon described it in her 1969 Rock Encyclopaedia, the album ""strengthened dreadful suspicion that the Doors were in it just for the money"". It also included the song ""The Unknown Soldier"", for which they created another self-directed music video, and ""Not to Touch the Earth"", excerpted from their legendary thirty-minute concept piece Celebration of the Lizard, although they were reportedly unable to record a satisfactory version of the entire piece for the LP. This was eventually released on a later greatest hits CD compilation.

A month after riotous scenes at the Singer Bowl, New York the group flew for their first dates outside of North America, to England. The group held a press conference at the ICA Gallery, London and played shows at The Roundhouse Theatre. The results of the trip were broadcast on Granada TV's ""The Doors Are Open"" and were later released on video. The group then played dates in Europe including a show in Amsterdam without Morrison after he collapsed from a drug binge. Morrison returned to London on September 20 and stayed for a month.

The group played nine more US dates and got to work in November on their fourth LP. 1969 would be a very difficult year for the group but it started well with a sold out show at the prestigious Madison Square Garden, New York on January 24 and with the success of new single ""Touch Me"" (released in December 1968), which hit US #3.

That month Morrison attended a theatre production which changed the course of his and the group's life. At the University of Southern California's Bovard Auditorium The Living Theatre took to the stage for a highly charged show which urged people to cast aside their inhibitions to freedom.

The show appealed to Morrison's quest for personal freedom, the results of which can be heard the next evening, February 25, during a studio jam which became the legendary ""Rock Is Dead"" session, later released on the 1997 Doors box set. The stage had been set for the most controversial episode of Morrison's life and one of the most notorious rock stories.

To fans of The Doors, the music included socially, psychologically and politically charged lyrics mostly written by 'The Lizard King', Jim Morrison. The jazz drumming of John Densmore, the swirling keyboards of Ray Manzarek, whose left hand played the parts typically associated with bass guitar, and Robby Krieger's guitar playing, which showed the influence of flamenco, Indian, the blues and classical music, combined to form a distinctive sound. The Doors were unusual among rock groups in that they did not use a bass guitarist in concert, with Manzarek playing the bass lines on a Fender electric keyboard bass, an offshoot of the well-known Fender Rhodes electric piano. However, the group utilized bass players such as Jerry Scheff, Doug Lubahn, Harvey Brooks, Kerry Magness, Lonnie Mack jazz bassist LeRoy Vinnegar and Ray Neapolitan on their albums.

Many of The Doors' originals were composed communally, with Morrison usually contributing the lyrics and some melody, while the others hammered out the beat and flow of the song. While Morrison and Manzarek were walking on the beach in California, they passed an African-American girl, and Morrison wrote the lyrics to Hello I Love You in a single night, referring to the girl as the ""dusky jewel"". The song received some criticism at the time for its resemblance to The Kinks' 1965 hit ""All Day and All of the Night"". Ray Davies, lead singer of the Kinks, sued the Doors for stealing the rhythm of ""All Day and All of the Night"".
[edit]

Mid career controversy: 1969–1971

The Doors quickly earned a reputation as a challenging and entertaining live act, as well as having a rebellious reputation. Jim Morrison was arrested on stage in New Haven for foul language which he had directed toward police at the concert. In one appearance on September 17, 1967 with a live performance on the Ed Sullivan Show on the Columbia Broadcasting System network, the network's censors demanded the group change its lyrics in its song, Light My Fire, altering the line, ""Girl, we couldn't get much higher"" because of the reference to drugs. However, Morrison sang the original line instead, and on live television with no delay CBS was powerless to stop it. Ed Sullivan was so furious that he refused to shake their hands and they were never invited back. Morrison later insisted he was nervous during the performance and forgot to change the line. (They weren't the only ones banned from the show. Eleven years earlier, Bo Diddley was banned from appearing on the show when he refused to sing Sixteen Tons.)

The most infamous incident occurred at the March 1, 1969 Dinner Key Auditorium concert in Miami, Florida. Morrison allegedly exposed himself during the performance. Morrison had been drinking since missing his flight to the show. The 6,900 seat auditorium had been oversold by almost double the hall's capacity and fans were sweltering without air conditioning. From the moment the band walked on stage Morrison started bellowing into the microphone:

""Now listen here, I ain't talking 'bout no revolution and I'm not talkin' about no demonstrations.

""I'm talking about having a good time, I'm talking about having a good time this summer. And you all come out to L.A., you all get out there, we're gonna lie down there in the sand and rub our toes in the ocean, and we're gonna have a good time, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready?

""Now listen! I used to think the whole thing was a big joke. I used to think it was something to laugh about. And then the last couple of nights I met some people who were doing somethin'! They're tryin' to change the world! And I wanna get on that trip! I wanna change the world. Wanna change it. Yeeeeeeaaaaaahhh - change it.""

Within a few minutes Morrison had changed his tune:

""Now listen, I'm not talkin' about no revolution, an' I'm not talkin' about no demonstration! I'm talkin' about having fun! I'm talkin' about dancin'! I wanna see you people get up and dance! I wanna see you people dancin' in the street this summer! I wanna see you have some fun. I wanna see you run around. I wanna see you paint the town. I wanna see you ringin' out. I wanna see you shout. I wanna see some fun. I wanna see some fun from everyone.""

The recording nears its end with the ominous words:

""ANYTHING YOU WANT! LET'S DO IT! LET'S DO IT! LET'S DO IT!""

The incident remains inconclusive. Morrison said: ""I wasted a lot of time with the Miami trial. About a year and a half. But I guess it was a valuable experience because before the trial I had a very unrealistic schoolboy attitude about the American judicial system. My eyes have been opened up a bit.""

While Morrison as the lead singer received the most attention of the group, as well as getting a far larger image of himself on album covers, he was quite adamant about all the members of the group getting recognition. Before one concert when the announcer introduced the group as ""Jim Morrison and The Doors"", Morrison in a rage refused to appear unless he announced the group again, solely as ""The Doors"". While he never felt close to his real life family, he was extremely protective of the rest of the members of The Doors. Reportedly, he once told Ray Manzarek that he never felt comfortable in a social setting unless Ray or another member of the band were with him. Many people have since come to the conclusion that he viewed The Doors as his surrogate family. This may be attributed the fact that he not only repeatedly turned down every solo album opportunity he was ever offered, but that the remaining members of The Doors refused to replace him as the singer of the band after his death.

Although the band's reputation was damaged Morrison was quietly relieved by the results of the Miami incident. He later said: ""I think I was just fed up with the image that had been created around me... and so I put an end to it in one glorious evening"".

Released from the chain of touring Morrison recorded some of his poetry that month and, in April, began shooting footage for HWY, an experimental film about a hitchiker, played by Morrison. The poetry session was used for the 1978 album An American Prayer where it was set to new music by The Doors. HWY, which contains virtually no dialogue, circulates among collectors although an official release has been rumored.

In the last two years of his life Morrison curtailed his former prodigious intake of psychedelic drugs and began drinking heavily, which in turn soon began to affect his performance, both on stage and in the studio. Apparently trying to escape the image of ""The Lizard King"" that had come to dominate him, Morrison put on weight and grew a thick beard, forcing Elektra to use photos taken earlier in his career for the cover of their Absolutely Live LP, released in 1970. The album features performances recorded on their 1970 American tour and at the 1969 Aquarius Theatre gig and includes a full-length live performance of ""The Celebration of the Lizard"".

The group's only public appearance was on a PBS television special, recorded late in April and broadcast the following month. Here the group performed songs from the upcoming Soft Parade album, including a stunning version of the title track.

The group resumed touring at Chicago Auditorium Theater on June 14 and proceeded to play two dates at The Aquarius Theatre, Hollywood on July 21 and 22, both later released on CD. The shows were typical of a new kind of Doors concert where the emphasis was more on the band and fans having a good time than having a shamanistic experience. The bearded Morrison wore loose fitting clothes and steered the bands towards a bluesier direction with songs like ""Build Me A Woman"", ""I Will Never Be Untrue"" and ""Who Do You Love"". Yet his voice had lost none of its power and the band could still dazzle with performances of ""When The Music's Over"" and ""Celebration of the Lizard"".

Their fourth album, The Soft Parade (1969), released in July, further distanced the group from the ""underground"", containing extremely pop-oriented arrangements, complete with ""Vegas-style"" horn sections (their single, ""Touch Me,"" featured saxophonist Curtis Amy).

Morrison's excessive drinking made him increasingly difficult and unreliable in the studio, and the sessions for the record dragged on for weeks (where they had formerly taken days). Studio costs piled up, and the group came close to disintegrating.

Critics of the record see the band as struggling to maintain momentum and attempting to expand their sound with a horn section and strings, resulting in a weak record suffering from bloated overproduction.

In its defense, The Soft Parade stands as an experiment that succeeded despite Morrison's erratic behavior and numerous technical challenges. In the context of the group's established repertoire, the record finds them exploring a new ""quasi-prog-pop"" direction. The more commercially-oriented songs such as ""Touch Me"" and ""Tell All The People"" are memorable; tracks such as ""Wild Child"" and ""Shaman's Blues"" are as stripped down and imaginitive as ever, with particularly excellent guitar and lyrics.

Amid the recording of their next album, in November 1969, Morrison found himself in trouble with the law again after becoming drunk and abusive to airline staff during a flight to Phoenix, Arizona to see The Rolling Stones in concert. He was acquitted the following April after a steward mistakenly identified Morrison as his traveling companion, American actor Tom Baker (Not the Tom Baker who played Dr. Who.)

The group started its year in New York again, this time over two nights at The Felt Forum. The two nights were well received.

The group staged a strong return to form with their excellent 1970 LP Morrison Hotel. Featuring a consistent, hard rock sound the album contains the memorable opener ""Roadhouse Blues"", which typified the high-spirited assuredness of the entire album. Morrison Hotel had a buoyancy and optimism that the band had never had before with a host of celebratory songs and a couple of lovely ballads. It hit US #4.

The group continued to perform at arenas throughout the summer and Morrison faced trial in Miami in August. The group managed to make it to The Isle of Wight on August 29th where a tired Morrison performed what was considered a below-par set. Songs from the show show up in 1995 on the Message To Love documentary.

On September 16th, Morrison took to the stand but it was in vain, the jury returning a guilty verdict for profanity and indecent exposure on September 20. Morrison was sentenced to eight months custody but was allowed to go free pending an appeal.

On December 8th, 1970, Morrison recorded another poetry session, on his 27th birthday.

The Doors last public performance was at the ""Warehouse"" in New Orleans, LA on Dec. 12th, 1970, where it appeared Morrison had a mental breakdown on stage (slamming the microphone numerous times into the stage floor).

The group looked set to regain their crown as one of America's premier acts with the superb L.A. Woman in 1971. It was conceived as a ""back to basics"" album which would explore their blues and R&B roots, although during rehearsals the group had a serious falling-out with Rothchild. Denouncing the new repertoire as ""cocktail music"", he quit and handed the production reins to Botnick. The result was widely considered a classic, featuring some of the strongest material and performances since their 1967 debut. Some dissenters, however, consider nearly half the album to be lackluster blues material, detracting severely from the album's overall quality. The atmospheric single ""Riders On The Storm"" became a mainstay of rock radio programming for decades.

Aftermath of Morrison's death: 1971–1989

In 1971, following the recording of L.A. Woman, Morrison decided to take some time out and moved to Paris with girlfriend Pamela Courson, in March. He had visited the previous summer and, for a time, seemed contented to write and explore the city. But by June he was once again drinking heavily and suffered a fall from a second story window in May. On June 16 the last known recording of Morrison was made when he befriended two street musicians at a bar and invited them to a recording studio. The drunken results were later released on bootleg CD.

Morrison died under mysterious circumstances on 3 July 1971; his body was found in the bathtub of his apartment. It was concluded that he died of a heart attack, although it was later revealed that no autopsy had been performed before Morrison's body was buried at the Père-Lachaise Cemetery on July 7.

Rumours persisted for many years that Morrison had faked his death to escape the spotlight, as did the rumour that Morrison had actually died at a Paris nightclub and that his body had been surreptitiously taken back to his apartment. However, in his book Wonderland Avenue, Morrison's former associate Danny Sugerman states that during his last meeting with Courson, which took place shortly before she died of a heroin overdose, she confessed to Sugerman that she had introduced Morrison to the drug and that, because he had a fear of needles, she had injected him with the dose that killed him.

The remaining Doors continued for some time. After initially considering replacing Morrison with a new singer, Krieger and Manzarek took over on vocals, and released two more albums, Other Voices and Full Circle. The Doors also toured during this time.

Both albums sold well, but not in the numbers of the Morrison era releases, and the Doors ceased all performing and recording activities at the end of 1972. While the first is unmistakably Doors in sound and style, the last album showed the Doors further expanding into jazz territory. While neither album have yet seen CD reissues in the U.S., they have been released on 2-on-1 CDs in Germany and Russia and are being heard via internet P2P networks and are undergoing fan reevaluation.

The remaining Doors recorded a third post-Morrison album, An American Prayer released in 1978, this time providing only backup music to recordings of Morrison's poetry.

In 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released Apocalypse Now with ""The End"" used prominently in the sound track. With this, ""The Doors"" were rediscovered by new fans. In 1983, ""Alive, She Cried"" was released, which included a cover version of the Them hit ""Gloria"", adding it officially to the Elektra Records discography.

The 1990s and beyond

In 1991, director Oliver Stone released his film The Doors, starring Val Kilmer as Morrison and with cameos by Krieger and Densmore. Ian Astbury of The Cult was Stone's preferred choice, but Astbury decided not to enter the acting world for reasons unknown. While all were amazed at Kilmer's impersonation, the film had numerous factual inaccuracies and members of the group later voiced displeasure at Stone's portrayal of Morrison, at times making him look like an out-of-control sociopath.

In 2002 Manzarek and Krieger reunited and created a new version of The Doors, called ""The Doors of the 21st Century"". In the place of Morrison, the new lineup was fronted by British vocalist Ian Astbury, former lead singer of UK band The Cult, with Angelo Barbera from Krieger's band on bass. At their first concert the group announced that drummer John Densmore would not perform, and it was later reported that he was unable to play because he suffered from tinnitus. Densmore was initially replaced by Stewart Copeland, formerly of The Police, but after Copeland broke his arm falling off a bicycle, the arrangement ended in mutual lawsuits and he was replaced by Ty Dennis, drummer with Krieger's band.

Densmore subsequently claimed that he had in fact not been invited to take part in the reunion. In February 2003 he filed an injunction against his former bandmates hoping to prevent them from using the name ""The Doors of the 21st Century"". His motion was denied in court in May that year, although Manzarek publicly reiterated that the invitation for Densmore to return to the group still stood. It was also reported that both Morrison's family and that of Pamela Courson had joined Densmore in seeking to prevent Manzarek and Krieger from using The Doors' name. In July 2005, Densmore and the Morrison estate won a permanent injunction; thereby preventing his former bandmates from using The Doors' name. The new band initially switched to the name ""D21C"" and now plays under the name Riders on the Storm, which is itself the name of a Doors tribute band in the northeastern US. They are allowed to play under names such as ""former Doors"" and ""members of The Doors"". Densmore has also been steadfast in refusing to license The Doors' music for use in television commercials, including an offer of $15 million by Cadillac to lease the song ""Break on Through (to the Other Side)"", feeling that that would be in violation of the spirit in which the music was created. Densmore wrote about this subject for The Nation, noting,

    People lost their virginity to this music, got high for the first time to this music. I've had people say kids died in Vietnam listening to this music, other people say they know someone who didn't commit suicide because of this music…. On stage, when we played these songs, they felt mysterious and magic. That's not for rent.

Manzarek and Krieger maintain that touring as a Doors revival and licensing the music to advertisements are a means to keep The Doors from fading into history. Manzarek was quoted as saying, ""We're all getting older. We should, the three of us, be playing these songs because, hey, the end is always near. Morrison was a poet, and above all, a poet wants his words heard.""

The Doors are remembered for shamanistic live performances. Some members of the ""establishment"", however, felt that they were merely American rock music rebels. Jim Morrison said: ""I like any reaction I can get with my music. Just anything to get people to think. I mean if you can get a whole room full of drunk, stoned people to actually wake up and think, you're doing something.""

Their enduring popularity is reflected by continuing sales of their early work.

Recorded output

The Doors left a reasonably concise discography for an era dominated by groups which seemed to rush out an album every six months and a high number of non-album singles. The first, self-titled album is generally thought to be the strongest and is a regular sight in greatest 100 album lists. Strange Days, Morrison Hotel and L.A Woman are all highly rated by fans and, due to their different styles, (psychedelic pop, hard rock, blues) appeal to some more than others. Waiting For The Sun contains some strong tracks but is thematically weak. The Soft Parade is considered by some to be ""plain bad and for fans only"".

1970's Absolutely Live and 1983's Alive She Cried are good examples of the band's live show and are available on CD. The 2CD In Concert is better value for money as it collects the two and adds an interesting version of ""The End"" from the Hollywood Bowl show in 1968.

Only three non-album tracks were released in the band's lifetime, the b-sides ""Who Scared You"", ""Tree Trunk"", and a cover of Willie Dixon's ""(You Need Meat) Don't Go Further"" sung by Ray. ""Who Scared You"" and ""(You Need Meat) Don't Go Further"" appeared on the 1972 compilation Weird Scenes Inside The Goldmine while only ""Who Scared You"" has since been given a further CD release, on the 1997 box set.

In 1978 the surviving Doors re-united to add music to poetry recorded by Morrison in 1969 and 1970. The resulting album was ""An American Prayer"" and was re-issued on CD in 1995 with bonus tracks ""Hour For Magic"", ""Freedom Exists"", ""A Feast Of Friends"", ""Babylon Fading"", ""Bird Of Prey"" and ""The Ghost Song (extended version)"".

The group had always shied away from releasing archive Doors material but in 1997 relented with the release of The Doors box set. While hardcore fans complained that most of the material had been previously released on bootlegs the 4CD set, one of which was a ""greatest hits"" type CD, proved popular. It was notable for a CD of highlights from the 1970 Felt Forum concert and a cleaned-up recording of the (edited) 1969 ""Rock Is Dead"" session. The surviving members again re-united to add new musical backing to the solo Morrison song ""Orange County Suite"".

In November 2000 came the announcement many fans had dreamed of when The Doors announced the creation of Bright Midnight Records, a label through which 36 albums and 90 hours of previously unreleased Morrison-era Doors material would be made available on CD. This was launched with a sampler of forthcoming material, mostly from live concerts. The first full release was a 2CD set of the May 1970 show at Detroit Cobo Arena. It was followed by two CDs of interviews, mostly with Morrison, and the two 1969 Aquarius shows and one of the rehearsals. A 4CD set ""Boot Yer Butt"" unashamedly used bootleg quality material but sold out nevertheless. It was notable for the inclusion of the only known performances of songs from L.A Woman including the title track and ""The Changeling"" from The Doors' last but one show, in December 1970, Dallas, Texas. In 2005 a 2CD concert from Philadelphia in 1970 was released.

Many illegal bootleg recordings are available of the group. Most impressive is a wealth of shows from March 1967 at the legendary Matrix Club in San Francisco. Many shows are available from 1968 when the band reached the height of its popularity, notably two shows in Stockholm, Sweden. The infamous Miami show has become widely available while many 1970 shows, notably a radio broadcast of the June 6 Vancouver show, make the rounds. The complete 1969 ""Rock Is Dead"" studio jam was discovered in the mid 1990s.

Recently, a commercial for Star Motorcycles featuring the Doors song ""Riders on the Storm"" has been seen.

alt-J,"Alt-J (sometimes stylised ∆) was formed when  Gwil Sainsbury (guitar, bass), Joe Newman (guitar, vocals), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards) and Thom Green (drums) met at Leeds, UK University in 2007. The band currently resides in Cambridge.

Unger-Hamilton studied English Literature; the other three Fine Art.  In their second year of studies, Newman showed Sainsbury a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Sainsbury acting as producer on Garageband. 

First as Daljit Dhaliwal and then as Films, the four friends spent the next two years playing around town.

Their eponymous first 4-track demo ∆, was recorded with producer Charlie Andrew in London and showcased the tracks ""Breezeblocks"", ""Hand-Made"", ""Matilda"" and ""Tessellate"". A 7"" containing ""Bloodflood"" and ""Tessellate"" was released by Loud and Quiet on October 2011.

Their first 2012 release for Infectious was the triangle shaped 7"" ""Matilda"" / ""Fitzpleasure"", followed by ""Breezeblocks"" as an advance of their first album An Awesome Wave, released on 25 May 2012. That same year, they won the prestigious Barclaycard Mercury Prize for An Awesome Wave.

On January 2014, Sainsbury announced that he had left the band. ""Hunger of the pine"" premièred in June, as an advance of their sophomore album This is all yours released at the end of September.

Guns N' Roses,"Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band founded in Los Angeles, California in 1985. 

The band has released six studio albums: Appetite For Destruction in 1987, G N' R Lies in 1988, Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II in 1991, ""The Spaghetti Incident?"" in 1993 and, after 15 years and with frontman Axl Rose being the only member of the original lineup remaining, Chinese Democracy in 2008. They also released an EP titled Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide in 1986 and two live albums, in 1999 and 2014.

The group was formed in early 1985 by Hollywood Rose members Axl Rose (vocals) and Izzy Stradlin (rhythm guitar) and L.A. Guns members Tracii Guns (lead guitar), Ole Beich (bass) and Rob Gardner (drums).  The band created its name by combining two of the members' names. A short time later, Beich was fired and replaced by Duff McKagan, and Guns was replaced by Slash after not showing up to rehearsal. Slash had played with McKagan in Road Crew and with Stradlin during a short stint in Hollywood Rose.  On their first tour (from Sacramento, California to Duff's home town of Seattle), Gardner quit and was replaced by Slash's friend, Steven Adler.

Stemming from the LA rock underground, the ugly lyrics matched the sleaze of the music--driven by heavy blues licks--covering misogyny, violence, city life, sex, liquor, and hard drugs. They also, however, had a tendency to show sensitivity and a desire to break free from the city. Subsequent albums revealed influence from bands in the vein of The Rolling Stones and Queen. 

Their 1987 breakthrough, Appetite for Destruction, (18-times platinum and the highest-selling debut album of all-time), coupled with the success of the hit single ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" in 1988, took the world by storm. ""Appetite"" was full of raunchy hard rock with blistering, anthemic guitar riffs and snarling vocals.

The followup EP, ""G N' R Lies"", contained four songs from their debut EP, three new acoustic songs, and an acoustic version of ""You're Crazy"". The album sold well and got into the top 10 alongside Appetite.  By the end of the 1980s, they were one of the most popular bands in the world. 

Steven Adler (original drummer) was kicked out of the band due to his drug abuse and replaced by Matt Sorum. 

Following the release of G N' R Lies, Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II made history by making the number 1 and 2 spots on the American Billboard Album chart. The albums were filled with songs that pushed Guns into a different direction, far from the Appetite era.  They surprised critics who expected hard rock songs but found more ""epic"" tracks featuring a wider range of instruments (pianos, brass instruments, various effects, etc). The main response was that instead of releasing two albums that included ""filler tracks"", they could have released one CD.  

The band then started a world tour to support the albums.  During this tour, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin quit the band due to differences with Slash, Sorum and McKagan due to his newfound sobriety and Stradlin's anger at Rose's management of the band.

They played 192 shows in the 28-month tour, which set attendance records and concluded with a show in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 17, 1993.  This show marked the last time original members Slash and McKagan and newcomers Clarke and Sorum would play a live show with Rose.

Axl began work on a new album of original material in 1993. In 1994, Gilby Clarke left the band, and was replaced with Paul Tobias. That same year, the band recorded a cover version of The Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" for the movie Interview with the Vampire. According to Slash's 2007 autobiography, the first version of guitar track was rejected by Axl, who wanted Slash to copy Keith Richards' playing on the original. Reluctantly, Slash agreed and recorded another version closer to the original. Slash was further infuriated when he discovered Tobias' guitar copying his own solo note by note layered in the final mix of the song. This would be the last recording by the original version of the band, and five years would go by before any new material came out under the Guns N' Roses name.

Slash drifted in and out of the band for the next couple of years, beginning a side project called Slash's Snakepit. In August 1996, GN'R returned to the studio, even though McKagan and Sorum were simultaneously touring with their side project, Neurotic Outsiders. Eventually, only Slash and Rose were left to continue working. During this period, Slash commented in an interview, ""My relationship with Axl right now is sort of at a stand still."" Additionally, Axl had approached guitarist Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black Label Society) about jamming and possibly joining Guns N' Roses. 

In 1996 and 1997, Slash, Sorum and McKagan all left the band, leaving Rose as the only remaining charter member of the band.  The three later formed rock supergroup Velvet Revolver with former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland and guitarist Dave Kushner.

In 1998, a ""clean"" (i.e., profanity removed) version of Use Your Illusion was released (in the USA only), mainly so the album could be sold in Wal-Mart and K-Mart stores. The album, titled ""Use Your Illusion"" was a 1 CD compilation of the 2 albums.

Also in 1998, Axl put a new version of the band together and returned to the studio. This version of the band has been touring and recording sporadically ever since. The new band's membership has changed frequently, but its core members have included guitarist Robin Finck, effects man Chris Pitman, bassist Tommy Stinson (formerly of The Replacements)— as well as Paul Tobias, drummer Josh Freese and longtime GN'R keyboardist Dizzy Reed.

In 1999, the band released one new song, ""Oh My God"", on the soundtrack of the film End of Days. The track featured additional guitar work by [arist]Dave Navarro and Gary Sunshine, Rose's personal guitar teacher. The song's release was intended to be a prelude to their new album, now officially entitled Chinese Democracy. Geffen also released Live Era '87-'93, a collection of live performances from various concerts during the Appetite for Destruction and Use Your Illusion tours. Also in 1999, during an interview with Kurt Loder for MTV, Axl said that he had re-recorded Appetite for Destruction with the new band, replacing two songs with ""Patience"" and ""You Could Be Mine"".

In 1999, guitarist Robin Finck departed the band in order to rejoin his former band, Nine Inch Nails, on tour. In 2000, virtuoso guitarist Buckethead joined Guns N' Roses as a replacement for Finck. Josh Freese was replaced with Bryan ""Brain"" Mantia (formerly of Primus). Robin Finck returned to Guns N' Roses in late 2000 to complement Buckethead on lead guitar.

The revised lineup finally made a public appearance in January 2001 with two well-received concerts, one in Las Vegas and one at the Rock in Rio Festival in Rio de Janeiro. The band played a mixture of old hits and new songs from their forthcoming album.

The new lineup played a further two shows in Las Vegas at the end of 2001. In 2002, rhythm guitarist Paul Tobias left the band because of his frustrations with life on the road. He was replaced by Richard Fortus (formerly of The Psychedelic Furs and Love Spit Love). The band then played several shows in August 2002, headlining festivals and concerts throughout Asia and Europe. They made their way to New York for a surprise appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September.

In 2002, the band's first North American tour since 1993 was organized to support Chinese Democracy. However, the opening show in Vancouver was canceled by the venue when Rose arrived late due to his plane being held up by bad weather conditions at Los Angeles airport.  A riot ensued. This tour was met with mixed results. Some concerts did not sell well, while shows in larger markets such as New York sold out in minutes. Due to a second riot by fans in Philadelphia, tour promoter Clear Channel canceled the remainder of the tour.

The band went on hiatus until they were scheduled to play at Rock in Rio IV in May 2004. However, Buckethead left the band in March of that year, causing them to cancel. Also in March 2004, Geffen released Guns N' Roses' Greatest Hits, since Rose had failed to deliver a new studio album in more than 10 years. Rose expressed displeasure with this album as its track listing was established without his consent and went as far as trying to block its release by suing Geffen. This failed, however, and the album went triple platinum in the USA.

In February 2006, demos of the songs ""Better"", ""Catcher in the Rye"", ""I.R.S."" and ""There Was a Time"" were leaked through a fan site. The band's management requested that all links to the MP3 files and all lyrics to the songs be removed from forums and web sites. Despite this, radio stations began adding ""I.R.S."" to playlists, and the song reached #49 on the Radio & Records Active Rock National Airplay chart in the final week of February - the first time an internet leak had done so.

On May 5, 2006, Axl appeared on the Friday Night Rocks with Eddie Trunk radio show (during an interview with ex-Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach) and said the new Guns N' Roses album would be released before the end of the year. Later in May, the band launched a European tour, headlining both the Download Festival and Rock In Rio - Lisbon. Four warm-up shows preceded the tour at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City and became the band's first live concert dates since the aborted 2002 tour. The shows also marked the debut of virtuoso guitarist and composer Ron ""Bumblefoot"" Thal, replacing Buckethead. During the tour, Bach and Izzy Stradlin made frequent guest appearances.  By the tour's end in 2007, the band had played to over 750 000 people in over 23 countries.

On April 5, 2008, a picture of Finck appeared on Nine Inch Nails web page under the title ""Welcome Back!"" starting the rumor of his possible reunion with Trent Reznor.  On April 11, Finck expressed his happiness on playing again with NIN.  On April 20, on Guns N' Roses' web site, Axl expressed surprise about the news.

Chinese Democracy had been given the tentative release date of March 6, then reported September 17, 2007. However, both dates passed with no sign of the album.  After further release dates were discussed, the album finally came out on November 23, 2008.

Slash, McKagan and Sorum still played together in Velvet Revolver. However, Izzy Stradlin, original GN'R rhythm guitarist and co-composer of many of the band's most successful songs, has not joined them. He did however play a few dates as a guest with GN'R in the summer of 2006. Keyboard player Dizzy Reed, while not a founding member of the band (joining in 1990 in the Use Your Illusion period), remained in the previous lineup. in 2014, Bassist Tommy Stinson had previous commitments to The Replacements, leading former bassist Duff McKagan to fill in. After the 2014 tour, Stinson, DJ Ashba, Ron ""Bumblefoot"" Thal, and Chris Pitman all left the band. Slash and McKagan rejoined in 2016, as did keyboardist Melissa Reese, as the group embarked on the ""Not in This Lifetime..."" stadium tour.

GN'R's current lineup includes Rose (lead vocals), McKagan (bass), Fortus (rhythm guitar), Slash (lead guitar), Melissa Reese[/bandember] (synth & programming), Frank Ferrer (drums) and Reed (keyboard and percussion). Guitarist   DJ Ashba was the band's second guitarist from 2009 until he left in 2015.   Keyboardist Chris Pitman also left before 2016.

Moby,"Moby (born Richard Melville Hall on September 11, 1965, in Harlem, New York) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, DJ and photographer. He is well-known for his electronic music, vegan lifestyle, and support of animal rights. From beginning as a musician in 1982, Moby gained attention in the early 1990s with his electronic dance music work that experimented in the techno and breakbeat genres. He has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. He has also released music under the names Voodoo Child, Barracuda, U.H.F., The Brotherhood, DJ Cake, Lopez, On the Rim of the Wheel a Nail, and Brainstorm/Mindstorm.

Moby plays keyboards, guitar and bass guitar. He took his performing name from the novel Moby-Dick by Herman Melville, who is his great-great-granduncle. His work, while focused in general on various forms of electronic music, have explored many other styles.

Early years

Moby used to be in a punk rock band called the Vatican Commandos, which was formed in 1980. The group evolved away from punk in 1989 for electronic music. He realized his music tastes and growth were going in a different direction than his previous band's vibe, and he broke off on his own.

His first album ""The Story So Far (aka Moby)"" featured the single ""Go"", which gained popularity in many discos, and earned a spot on the UK charts. The song is so popular that Moby still plays ""Go"" regularly in his sets. ""Go"" is a progressive track using the string line from ""Laura Palmer's Theme"" from the TV drama Twin Peaks.

1994-1998

His first album for the UK based MUTE Records was Everything Is Wrong (which had US distribution via Elektra) , which earned early critical praise and minor commercial success. He followed that up with a hard rock/electronic album called Animal Rights in 1996. In 1997, he released I Like to Score, a collection of music included in movies. Among those tracks was an updated version of the James Bond theme used for the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. However, both Animal Rights and I Like to Score had only limited success and Moby and Elektra parted company however he remained signed to MUTE.

1999-2004

After a decade's worth of music, Moby's breakthrough album was 1999's Play. Mainstream reviewers raved about his talents on the album (released on V2 Records) though some early fans were let down. The album has 18 tracks and was the first album in history to have all of its tracks commercially licensed: ""Porcelain,"" for instance, appeared on TV commercials for Bailey's Irish Cream, Hong Kong's PCCW and Nordstrom, and Volkswagen's MKIV Jetta; ""Find My Baby"" was on a commercial for American Express featuring golfer Tiger Woods. The album's tracks eventually were accepted in various radio formats, but because of Play's extensive licensing, the album could have been financially successful even without radio play. In addition to fame garnered through its licensing, Play is also notable for its extensive sampling of old blues recordings collected by Alan Lomax. In a 2005 posting on his web site, Moby theorized that his eagerness to license his music is a result of ""growing up in poverty.""

In 2001, Moby founded the Area:One Festival. It was a popular touring rock festival that featured an eclectic range of musical genres. A second tour was organized for the following year.

In 2001 Moby also earned the ire of Eminem after calling his music misogynistic and homophobic; Eminem later satirized Moby (among others) in ""Without Me,"" calling him a ""fag"" and questioning his relevance with the claim ""Nobody listens to techno."" Moby replied that he hadn't played techno since 1992. The two were in a confrontation at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, though Moby expresses respect for Eminem as an artist.

In 2002, Moby briefly had a television show on MTV, Señor Moby's House of Music, which focused mostly on more obscure electronic music. Also in 2002, Moby released 18, an album that had 18 tracks. The most popular song on the album was ""We Are All Made of Stars"". Moby says he wrote ""We Are All Made of Stars"" because of the September 11th Terrorist Attacks, which happened on his birthday.

2005

In 2005 Moby released ""Lift Me Up"", a single from his album Hotel, which featured, in addition to numerous remixes, UK company Digimpro's software. The program allows users to remix the song - using any or all of the samples included—and save it as an MP3 file. Thus unlimited, personalized versions of the title track were possible. Digimpro had previously seen exposure with group Erasure's single ""Breathe,"" allowing users the same ability. Instead of his usual usage of samples, all of the vocals and instruments on ""Hotel"" were performed live in the studio by Moby and vocalist Laura Dawn, who is the Cultural Director of MoveOn.org.

For certain dates on Moby's 2005 European tour, Liveherenow provided concert goers with CDs of the show 10 minutes after the show finished. Other Mute Records artists like Erasure and Client have previously used this company for similar reasons.

2006

Moby has recently scored the soundtrack for Richard Kelly's upcoming movie 'The Southland Tales'. Whilst he is generally against composing music for films, he was a huge fan of Kelly's previous film 'Donnie Darko' and could not resist the offer the director gave him.

ITV in the United Kingdom use Moby's song ""Lift Me Up"" for their coverage of Formula One racing by using the song as the intro. and also snippets to segues for interviews and advertisements. 

Also, Moby had one of his older songs used in a Original HBO series, The Sopranos. This song, ""When its Cold I'd like to Die"" was used in the last scene in which Tony was in his dream state. 

Besides music

Moby is a vegan, non-denominational Christian and self-proclaimed ""simpleton"" (for his often sincere and idealistic political assessments).
 Moby lives in New York City. Until recently he co-owned a small restaurant and coffee shop called TeaNY, where he occasionally waited tables. He also organized the Little Idiot Collective, a group of artists that also includes cartoonist and musician James Kochalka. He's a huge fan of the TV series ""The Simpsons"".

Moby's official website is at moby.com.

Activism

Moby is a well known advocate for a variety of progressive causes, working with MoveOn.org, and PETA, among others. He created MoveOn Voter Fund's ""Bush in 30 Seconds"" contest along with singer Laura Dawn and MoveOn Executive Director Eli Pariser.

He also actively engages in nonpartisan activism. He has performed benefit concerts for the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function, promoting music therapy. Moby also serves on the Board of Directors of Amend.org, a nonprofit that implements injury prevention programs in Africa.

He is an advocate of network neutrality and he testified before the US House committee debating the issue in 2006. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Moby"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Disclosure,"There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Disclosure are Guy and Howard Lawrence, two brothers from the UK making house/future music. After their debut single on Moshi-Moshi Records in september 2010, the duo released a 4 track EP on Transparent Records a year after. 2012 saw the release of ""Tenderly / Flow"" and The Face EP on Greco-Roman. Their first single for Universal Record's PMR was called ""Latch"". On February 1st 2013, they released ""White Noise"", featuring vocals by Aluna Francis from AlunaGeorge.

Their debut album ""Settle"" was released on June 3rd , preceded by the single ""You & Me"" released on April 28th and premiered by Annie Mac on BBC Radio One on April 19th.

http://disclosureofficial.com

2) On their previous tour, Disclosure arrived in Newport News, Va, 4 1/2 hours from home to learn that their show had been cancelled. Here, most bands would have called it a day, but instead they frantically called friends to search for shows via myspace. They ended up playing for free and headlining a show in Richmond, Va. This is just one of many stories that showcase Disclosure’s dedication.
In the past 3 years they have released 3 albums, have been part of an East Coast distributed compilation, performed in 7 states, went on 2 self-booked tours, and played over 50 shows. They have an upcoming full East Coast tour scheduled for July/August 2010 and they have no plans of slowing down. 

3) Side project of Crunch Pod artist C/A/T. With the Disclosure project, Ben Arp of C/A/T shifts the focus towards tense samples and hard rhythmic sequences. While C/A/T has had a more abstract sound, Disclosure presents a more sonically straight-forward approach to songwriting. “Full Disclosure” attempts to further lift the veil and reveal the hidden hand that orchestrates world events. Extremely limited run of 25 copies and available only at Crunch Pod and was only available at live C/A/T performances in Summer 2005.
CD-R version is out of print. This album was recently re-issued as a digital download direct from Crunch Pod.

4) An Alternative/Powerpop/Rock band from Faringdon, UK. Formed 5 years ago Disclosure have earnt their reputation as one of the most exciting bands to emerge from the Swindon area through relentless gigging, energetic shows and great sounds. Performing on stage with the likes of Young Guns and The Rileys, Disclosure have played at many of the biggest and most respected venues and festivals in and around Oxfordshire. Now signed with New Vision Records and having recently released their latest EP at the o2 academy2 Islington, Disclosure have never sounded so focussed and relevant and this year will be hitting venues around the UK.

Placebo,"There are multiple artists with this name: 1) A popular British rock band. 2) A Belgian jazz band. 3) A Canadian punk band. 4) A British post-punk duo.

1) Placebo is a three-piece alternative rock band, formed in London, United Kingdom, when former Luxembourg schoolmates Brian Molko and Stefan Olsdal - who never actually spoke to each other at the time - met by accident at South Kensington train station in 1994. During their 'accidental' meet, Molko invited Olsdal to one of his gigs, where Olsdal was impressed by Molko's unique vocals. While briefly known as Ashtray Heart, the band soon settled on the name Placebo, after the drug that has no active ingredient but works because the patient believes it does.

Soon after forming, the band could not decide on a permanent drummer, with Steve Hewitt (drums) and Robert Schultzberg both alternating on the spot. While Hewitt was the preferred choice, he was bound by other musical commitments as drummer for London-based band Breed, leading to Schultzberg being the drummer when the band signed its contract with Caroline Records. As time went on, Molko and Schultzberg began to drift apart as friends, which eventually led to Molko and Olsdal persuading Hewitt to rejoin the band shortly after their debut album was released.

The singles ""Nancy Boy"", from Placebo (1996), and ""Pure Morning"", from Without You I'm Nothing (1998), are still to this day the peak of their British success, with both tracks charting in the top ten. Since Without You I'm Nothing, the band have fallen out of fashion, particularly with the British music press, who regularly mocked the personality and pretensions of its lead member, Brian Molko. However, the band retained a huge popular and critical following in continental Europe.

Their musical style has not altered between the debut album Placebo and latest album Battle For The Sun, with their early work based around fairly straightforward guitar playing, often influenced by the style of 1970s British and American rock, and Molko's high-pitched, nasal vocals. However, the evolution of the band has led to the experimental use of both dance music (particularly seen on Black Market Music and Sleeping With Ghosts)and orchestrated pieces on their most recent album.

The band's debut album, Placebo, was recorded between 1995 and 1996 and was followed by a tour of Europe with David Bowie. Their breakthrough is often said to have come with the single Nancy Boy, which gained large success across Europe as the band began to prepare recordings for their next offering.

The second album, Without You I'm Nothing, was released in 1998. The album saw the release of single Pure Morning, which is still to this day often seen as one of the band's most popular tracks. David Bowie lent his vocals to the title track and fourth single from the album, Without You I'm Nothing. 

After two years of touring and recording, Placebo returned in 2000 with their third album, Black Market Music, followed by the release of Sleeping With Ghosts in 2003. In 2004, the band released a live DVD called ""Soulmates Never Die"", which contained live footage from a live concert in Bercy, Paris on their Sleeping With Ghosts tour.

The 2003 release was followed by the singles collection, Once More With Feeling, which included two new tracks I Do and Twenty Years. Twenty Years was selected as the first and only single from the compliation, and a DVD including all their videos and an exclusive documentary interview with the band members was released in conjunction.

The band's fifth album, Meds was released on 03.03.06 (04.04.06 in the United States). The album was followed by a lengthy worldwide tour throughout 2006, and, towards the end of the year, a live, Internet-only EP, 'Live at La Cigale' was released, containing six songs from Meds, and two songs from previous albums.

The band also reissued their original self-titled album with extra DVD content in late 2006 to celebrate its tenth birthday. ""The 10 Year Anniversary Collectors Edition"" was released on 25.09.06, complete with two B-Sides ('Drowning by Numbers' and 'Slackerbitch') and two rare demos ('Paycheck' and 'Flesh Mechanic'). The DVD contains performances by the band and the official videos for the singles from the 'Placebo' album.

In October 2007, it was announced on the band's website that Steve Hewitt had left the band. The split was considered 'amicable' by Molko, and that both sides, although disappointed, understood the decision, despite multiple rumours that reported the contrary. However, in mid-2008, Placebo, along with new drummer Steve Forrest, recorded their sixth album, Battle for the Sun, which was released in June 2009. Since it's release, the band has been touring and promoting the album worldwide.

2) Placebo is a Belgian jazz band. Leader Marc Moulin (already a veteran by the early 70's since he started in 63 with saxman Scorier) was the main composer of this rather large group (they had a four-man brass section) somewhere between Nucleus and a funky Chicago Transit Authority but with that bizarre and sometimes weird/silly Belgian spirit/absurdism. Their three albums (from 71 to 74) were widely played on the alternative scene in the early 70's, so much so, that they appeared in concert on National TV (still to be released commercially but aired two years ago). 

Their debut ""Balls of Eyes"" is maybe their better one (it won a prize at 1972's Montreux Jazz Festival), but the 1973 album is not far behind. After a rather disappointing eponymous album (on the Harvest label), they slowly disbanded, giving their last concert in 76. Marc Moulin will then have a long solo career (his best album being Sam Suffy in 75), diddle in Eurovision spoof-group Telex, work with great Belgian group Cos (see their entry), produced many artist (Philip Catherine a.o.), host his own radio show, had his own record label and for the last 15 years has been a precursor in acid-jazz. Although none of their vinyls have received a CD reissue (yet), there is now a compilation that is really an excellent introduction and the track selection suffers no discussion: you are getting the best one possible. Actually their records gained back some interest since they were sampled a few times for Trip-hop records.

3) Feist was the lead vocalist for a Calgary punk band called Placebo as early as age 15 in 1991.

4) In 1982 Gary and Michelle Wild (a married couple) found their way to the small village of Pity Me near Durham and laid down nine tracks at Guardian Studios. The resulting LP was entitled 'England's Trance' and issued by Aura Records the same year.

Madonna,"Madonna Louise Ciccone (born on 16 August 1958 in Bay City, Michigan, United States), known simply as Madonna, is a recording artist, entrepreneur and occasional actress, often referred to as The Queen of Pop. Throughout her career, many of her songs have hit number one on international music charts, including Like a Virgin, Papa Don't Preach, Like a Prayer, Vogue, Frozen, Music, Hung Up,  and 4 Minutes (feat. Justin Timberlake & Timbaland). Madonna has been praised by critics for her diverse musical productions while at the same time serving as a lightning rod for religious controversy, specifically and especially with the Catholic Church.

Her career has been further enhanced by film appearances, despite mixed reviews. She won critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her role in Evita (1996), but has received harsh feedback for other film roles. Madonna's other ventures include being a fashion designer, children's book author, film director and producer. She has been acclaimed as a businesswoman, and signed an unprecedented US $120 million contract with Live Nation in 2007.

Madonna has sold more than 300 million records worldwide and is recognized as the world's top-selling female recording artist of all time by the Guinness World Records. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked Madonna number two (after The Beatles) on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making her the most successful solo artist in the history of the chart. Considered to be one of the ""25 Most Powerful Women of the 20th Century"" by Time for being an influential figure in contemporary music, Madonna is known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry. She is recognized as an inspiration among numerous music artists.

After signing to Sire Records in 1982, Madonna's debut single Everybody was released in October of the same year. One year later, her eponymous debut album followed, and since then hits such as Holiday, Like a Virgin, Papa Don’t Preach and Like a Prayer catapulted her to massive success. By the 1990s, her commercially successful albums, constantly reinvented image, groundbreaking music videos and controversial nature would earn her the title “Queen of Pop.”

Apart from achieving 12 No.1 singles, 37 top 10 singles and 48 top 40 hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, Madonna also maintains the record for the most separate calendar weeks as a female artist with a charting single in any position (853+ weeks). She has also garnered 21 MTV Video Music Awards - the most by any artist (including the special Video Vanguard Award), eight Grammy Awards, as well as a Best Actress (Musical or Comedy) Golden Globe Award for her performance in “Evita”. Two soundtrack cuts performed by Madonna, ""Sooner or Later"" and ""You Must Love Me"", have been awarded with Academy Awards (Oscars). On the United World Chart, Madonna is the Most Successful Singles Artist of All Time and has a record of 13 number one singles. Madonna also holds the record of 40 #1 Hot Dance Club Play hits in the US, the most for any artist ever. Her 2008-2009 Sticky & Sweet Tour remains the two highest-grossing concert tour ever by a female solo artist, having grossed US$ 408 million.

Madonna's 13th studio album, Rebel Heart, was released in March 2015. Initially scheduled for release in late April 2015, the release of the album was brought forward to early March 2015 following the leak of several early demo recordings in December 2014, while six tracks from the album were officially released into iTunes on 20 December 2014. On the same day, Living for Love was released as the album's lead single. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Madonna"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Blur,"Blur is an alternative rock band which formed in Colchester, England in 1989. The band consists of Damon Albarn (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Graham Coxon (guitar, vocals), Alex James (bass) and Dave Rowntree (drums). Blur's debut album Leisure (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and Shoegazing and spawned their first UK Top 10 single, There's No Other Way. Following a stylistic change in 1992 (influenced by English guitar groups such as The Kinks, The Beatles, The Animals and XTC) Blur released ""Popscene"" as a stand alone single, this was a commercial flop, but was widely considered to be a crucial turning point for the band's style. Following this, Blur released 3 studio albums in a similar style: Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a famous chart battle with rival band Oasis dubbed ""The Battle of Britpop"". 

By the late 1990s, with the release of Blur (1997), the band underwent another reinvention, influenced by the lo-fi style of American indie rock bands such as Pavement; in the process, Blur finally gained mainstream success in the US with the single, ""Song 2"". The last album featuring the band's original lineup, 13 (1999) found Blur experimenting with electronic music and gospel music, as Albarn wrote more personal lyrics. In May 2002, Coxon left Blur during the recording of their seventh album Think Tank (2003). Containing electronic sounds and simpler guitar playing, the album was marked by Albarn's growing interest in hip-hop and African music. 

In December 2008, Blur announced that they would be reforming for the first time since their hiatus in 2003, complete with Graham Coxon, for a UK Tour in 2009. Blur headlined the Oxegen Festival in Ireland, Glastonbury and the T in the Park Festival in the UK, as well as Dates in London, Manchester, Newcastle, Southend and Wolverhampton. The band continues to be sporadically active, releasing the single ""Fool's Day"" and the documentary ""No Distance Left to Run"" in 2010, and performing several concerts in 2012. Two new songs, ""Under the Westway"" and ""The Puritan"", were released in 2012 leading up to a post-Olympics concert which also features New Order, The Specials and Bombay Bicycle Club. In 2015, Blur released The Magic Whip. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Blur"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Weezer,"Weezer is an American rock band. Formed in 1992, they have released eight full length albums, six EPs, and a DVD. Their latest album, titled 'Weezer (White Album)', came out on April 1st, 2016. They've sold over nine million records in the United States to date. Playing music influenced by alternative bands and power pop artists among others, they're sometimes viewed as a part of the 90s indie movement.

Weezer started in Los Angeles, California when Rivers Cuomo joined with Patrick Wilson, Matt Sharp, and Jason Cropper, who was later replaced by Brian Bell. Five weeks after forming, they had their first gig, opening for Dogstar at Raji's Bar and Ribshack on Hollywood Boulevard. Weezer began playing clubs to small audiences around L.A. and recording homemade demos. The group soon received attention from various A&R reps, and the guys were signed on June 26, 1993 by Todd Sullivan, an A&R rep from Geffen Records. The band became a part of the DGC label (which later turned into Interscope).

Creating ""The Blue Album"" (1993-1994)

The self-titled debut, 'Weezer', commonly referred to as 'The Blue Album', came out on May 10, 1994. It picked up considerable acclaim. Tracks ""Undone (The Sweater Song)"" (also known as ""Undone - The Sweater Song""), ""Buddy Holly"", and ""Say It Ain't So” were released as singles. The album was produced by former The Cars frontman Ric Ocasek. During the recording of the Blue Album, Jason Cropper left the band to take care of his future wife, who was pregnant with their first child. Jason was replaced by Brian Bell, a then bassist from a band called Carnival Art.

The first single, ""Undone - The Sweater Song"", garnered attention given that Spike Jonze directed the music video for the track. In a single, unbroken take, that video featured Weezer performing the song on a sound stage with various amusing studio antics, including a pack of dogs swarming the set. Jonze also later directed the band's second video, which was made for the single ""Buddy Holly"".

Named after the famous 50s rock star, the ""Buddy Holly"" music video featured footage of the television sitcom Happy Days spliced with the band performing in a remade ""Arnold's Diner"", a setting from the series. The video had heavy rotation on MTV. It went on to win Jonze and the band four MTV Video Music Awards (including Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Music Video) and two Billboard Music Video Awards. This video was also included as a bonus on the Microsoft Windows 95 CD. The success of the video arguably served as the key for pushing the band into the mainstream rock spotlight.

The video for Weezer's third single, ""Say It Ain't So"", was directed by Sophie Muller. It featured the bandmates playing hacky-sack and performing in the band's original rehearsal space in California. A photo of what the band calls the ""Garage"" is featured on the inside cover of the album.

'The Blue Album' is currently certified three times platinum, making it Weezer's all-time best seller and one of the most popular rock albums of the early 90s. It was re-released and repackaged in 2004 as a ""Deluxe Edition"". That version of the album included a second disc of B-sides along with other previously unreleased rarities.

Killer Record: Pinkerton(1995-1997)

In late December 1994, Weezer took a break from touring for the Christmas holidays. Cuomo traveled back east to his home state of Connecticut. Using an eight-track recorder, he began piecing together demo material for Weezer's next album. Cuomo's original concept for Weezer's sophomore effort was to be a space-themed rock opera, with him mulling over the title 'Songs from the Black Hole'.

The album was intended to feature songs that flowed together seamlessly, and it was planned to end with a special coda that briefly revisited the major musical elements of the piece (something reminiscent of progressive rock works from the 70s). The band began demoing and working on Cuomo's concept through intermittent recording sessions in the spring and summer of 1995. Ultimately, the 'Songs from the Black Hole' album concept was dropped. The album that actually came out would instead feature some old tunes made from before their first album (which had briefly been incorporated into the space-opera) as well as some new ones written while Cuomo was at Harvard.

After the multi-platinum success of their debut album, Weezer's sophomore album was finally released on September 24, 1996. Titled 'Pinkerton', the work peaked at #19 in the U.S. upon its release. It didn't sell as many copies as its predecessor, probably due to its darker, more abrasive nature. Pinkerton was labeled ""one of the worst albums of 1996"" by a Rolling Stone reader poll. Eventually, the album grew into a cult classic, and is viewed by some fans as Weezer's greatest album. In fact, in 2004, the magazine changed their rating to a 5-star rating and inducted it into The Rolling Stone Hall Of Fame. This article can be found in the Reviews sections of the 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time issue.

Three singles were taken from the album: ""El Scorcho"", ""The Good Life"" and ""Pink Triangle"". The video for ""El Scorcho"" featured the band inside a darkened room, sitting in a circle, that would be lit differently throughout parts of the song; it was directed by Mark Romanek. The video for ""The Good Life"" was directed by the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (though no known video was made for ""Pink Triangle""). However, the singles did not receive as much airtime as the singles from their debut album.

The title of the album comes from the character Lieutenant Pinkerton in Giacomo Puccini's opera Madame Butterfly. The entire album is heavily influenced by the opera's story line. Madame Butterfly is mentioned under her real name, Cio-Cio San, in ""El Scorcho."" The song ""Butterfly"" is written from Pinkerton's point of view at the end of the opera.

The album's title was the source of a legal challenge. Pinkerton Securities of Encino, Calif., filed a temporary restraining order against the band and its Geffen record label for copyright infringement two days before the album was to be released on September 24, 1996. A judge ruled against the security company and the album was finally released.

Weezer completed their touring for Pinkerton in the summer of 1997. The members of the band took a break, with drummer Patrick Wilson returning to his home in Portland, Oregon to work on his side project, The Special Goodness, Matt Sharp left to complete the follow-up album for his group The Rentals, and Brian Bell went to work on his group, Space Twins.

Rivers Cuomo returned to Boston, Massachusetts, but dropped out of Harvard to focus on songwriting. He eventually went into seclusion. He painted his walls black, disconnected his phone, and didn't communicate with anyone. Later, he formed a solo group, The Rivers Cuomo Band. Cuomo used the group to try out unreleased material, including possible new songs for the next Weezer album. The band played their first show at T.T. the Bear's on October 8, 1997. Future Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh was part of the solo band's lineup. The Boston songs were later abandoned and not used on the next Weezer album, but live recordings of the Boston shows are openly traded on the internet. In February of 1998, Rivers left Boston and Harvard academia behind and returned to Los Angeles.

Pat Wilson and Brian Bell joined Cuomo in L.A. to start work on the next album. Matt Sharp did not rejoin the band and officially left the group in April of 1998. The group decided on Mikey Welsh as Sharp's replacement. Weezer continued rehearsal and cut demos until the fall of 1998. Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in rehearsals, and in late fall of 1998, drummer Pat Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo.

The band would not reunite until April of 2000, when the Fuji Festival in Japan offered Weezer a high-paying gig to play in August 2000. The festival served as a catalyst for Weezer's productivity, and from April to May, 2000, the band rehearsed and demoed new songs in Los Angeles. The band returned to live shows in June 2000, but without the Weezer name. Instead the shows featured the group's first use of the pseudonym Goat Punishment.

On June 23, 2000, the band, now back under the Weezer name, joined the Warped Tour for eight planned dates. Weezer was received well at the festival, leading the band to book more tour dates for the summer.

SS2K - The Summer Sessions (2000)

In the summer of 2000, Weezer (now consisting of Rivers Cuomo, Mikey Welsh, Pat Wilson, and Brian Bell) went on tour. Weezer's setlist consisted of 14 new songs that fans have labeled the Summer Songs of 2000 (commonly abbreviated, SS2K). When 13 of these songs did not appear on Weezer's next album, fans of the songs started a petition demanding the release of studio demos. Eventually, mp3s were made available on the band's official website for download. Three SS2K songs, ""Hash Pipe"", ""Dope Nose"" and ""Slob,"" have appeared on studio albums (""Hash Pipe"" on the Green Album and ""Dope Nose"" and ""Slob"" appearing on Maladroit).

Green Album & Maladroit (2001-2003)

Eventually, the band went back into the studio to produce a third album. Weezer (2001) chose to repeat the self-titled name of their first release. This album quickly became known as The Green Album due to its distinctive bright green coloring. Shortly after the release of The Green Album, Weezer went on another American tour. They attracted a new generation of fans thanks to heavy MTV rotation for the videos of their hit singles ""Hash Pipe"" and ""Island in the Sun.""

The video for ""Hash Pipe,"" directed by Marcos Siega featured sumo wrestlers and was nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost out to Limp Bizkit's ""Rollin."" Two videos were recorded for ""Island in the Sun."" Marcos Siega directed the first, which focused on a Mexican wedding, and Spike Jonze directed the second, which involved Weezer with animals in a wildlife reserve. Their video for ""Photograph"" was shot and put together by Weezer friend and unofficial ""5th member"" Karl Koch.

As reported on August 16th, 2001, by MTV, bassist Mikey Welsh was checked into a psychiatric hospital. His whereabouts were previously unknown, as he mysteriously went missing before their second filming of the ""Island in the Sun"" music video, featuring the band with various animals. Weezer was prompted to find a temporary replacement for Welsh. Through a mutual friend, Cuomo received Scott Shriner's number and asked if he was interested to fill in for Welsh. Shriner, at first believing it was a prank phone call, accepted.

Much to the ire of their recording label, Weezer decided to forgo the industry-preferred waiting period of 2 to 3 years between albums and began recording demos for their fourth album. The band took an experimental approach for the recording process by allowing fans to download the demos from their official website in return for feedback. After the release of the album, the band subsequently stated that the process was somewhat of a failure, as the fans did not supply them with cohesive constructive advice. Only the song ""Slob"" was included on the album due to general fan advice.

The fourth album, Maladroit, was released in 2002 with Scott Shriner replacing Mikey Welsh on the bass. The album served as a harder-edged version of their trademark catchy pop-influenced music. Although met with generally positive critical reviews (including making many ""Best of '02"" lists), its sales were not as strong as The Green Album and remains their worst-selling album to date.

Two singles were released from the album. The ""Dope Nose"" music video featured a Japanese motorcycle gang, and was put into regular rotation. The music video for ""Keep Fishin'"" combined Weezer with The Muppets, and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.

As soon as Maladroit had wrapped up, the band immediately began work on their fifth album, recording numerous demos between tours for Maladroit (often recording as many as 24 songs in a day). These songs were eventually scrapped, and Weezer took a break after the release of two albums in quick succession.

Make Believe (2003-2005)

In March of 2004, Weezer released their first DVD. Titled Video Capture Device, the DVD contains all of their then-current music videos. It also included live concerts and homemade movies. The DVD was certified ""gold"" on November 8, 2004.

From December 2003 to the summer and early fall of 2004, the members of Weezer recorded a large amount of material intended for a new album to be released in the spring of 2005 with producer Rick Rubin. The band's early recording efforts became available to the public through the band's website. The demos, entitled the Album Five Demos (or album 4.5), were a big hit with fans but only one song, ""Hold Me"", would be included on the finished album. That album, entitled Make Believe, was released on May 10, 2005. The album was very well received by the public. However, long-time Weezer fans often consider it as a decline from their earlier albums, and has received mixed reviews.

The album's first single, ""Beverly Hills,"" became a hit in the U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after its release. The video for ""Beverly Hills"", directed by Marcos Siega, featured the band and a select choice of fans interacting with Playboy Bunnies and Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion. It became the first Weezer song to hit #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The song was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video for the song was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards.

During the ""Make Believe"" tour of 2005, Cuomo allowed other members of the band to step into the spotlight of certain songs:

    * Brian Bell: ""Getchoo"" and ""Why Bother?"" (from Pinkerton), ""Smile"" (from ""The Green Album""), and ""Keep Fishin'"" (from Maladroit)
    * Scott Shriner: ""Fall Together"", and ""Dope Nose"", and ""In the Garage"" (from ""The Blue Album"")
    * Patrick Wilson: ""Photograph"" (from ""The Green Album""), ""Song 2"" (Blur cover, whilst playing lead guitar)

In late August 2005, Weezer performed with the rock band The Pixies, which was one of Rivers' influences, at Summerfest and other dates.

From September 8 to October 28, 2005, Weezer set out on a tour with the Foo Fighters, which, to many, was simply called Foozer. The Foozer tour was awarded ""Most Creative Tour Package"" at The 17th Annual Concert Industry Awards.

On December 13th, 2005, Winter Weezerland EP was released on iTunes. The EP was essentially a re-release of the 2000 Weezer christmas CD which featured ""The Christmas Song"" and ""Christmas Celebration"".

Also, in late 2005 the band released the second single off Make Believe, called ""We Are All on Drugs"" (for family-oriented purposes, some releases of the song were renamed ""We Are All in Love""), and the music video was directed by Justin Francis. It didn't do well as a single, and many weezer fans hated it.

In early 2006, it was announced that Make Believe was certified platinum, and ""Beverly Hills"" was the second most popular download on iTunes for 2005.

Also in early 2006, Make Believe's third single, ""Perfect Situation"", spent four weeks in a row at the #1 spot on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, a personal record for Weezer. The Perfect Situation video starred Elisha Cuthbert and was directed by Marc Webb. The only other Weezer track to hit #1 was ""Beverly Hills,"" for one week. ""This is Such a Pity"" is the band's fourth single from the album, but no music video was made for its release.

The Future (2006-)

As of January, 2006, Bell and Wilson are set to portray Velvet Underground members Lou Reed and John Cale in Factory Girl, an upcoming film about the life of Andy Warhol cohort Edie Sedgwick.

Rivers Cuomo announced a new song called ""Piece of the Pie"" while onstage during the band's October 7th, 2005 show in Detroit (but did not perform it). Cuomo has mentioned other song ideas recently, dropping titles and ideas such as ""East Coast or West Coast,"" ""Pig"" and new songs with lyrics he described as ""bloggy"".

Rivers has commented on his myspace blog that his recent comments to mtv.com were 'misquoted' and said that what he meant ""was that the soccer song, ""Our Time will Come"", certainly won't be on a Weezer album."" and said ""The rest of the songs, though, are definite contenders for a Weezer record."" A strong hint that the band are in fact only on a break and that a sixth album is on the card.

In late 2006, Brian Bell began work on a new project called The Relationship which fans can follow on the band's myspace page. Pat Wilson told Keifer Wells and Martin Michalek in a radio interview for Andover High School that he and Scott Shriner had been creating songs together and are trying to get Rivers to sing for when the band has jam sessions. Pat has also been creating a few Special Goodness songs, but said little more on the subject. Fans can currently follow the news of the band at Rivers Cuomo's myspace page and the official Weezer website.

Weezer's sixth studio album will be released on June 3, 2008, just over three years after their latest release, Make Believe. Rick Rubin produced the album[30] and Rich Costey provided the mixing[31] for what Weezer fans are calling ""Album Six"".[32] The record is being described as ""experimental"", and according to Cuomo, includes longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808 drum machines, synthesizers, Southern rap, baroque counterpoint, and band members other than Cuomo writing, singing, and switching instruments.[33]

Lead singer Rivers Cuomo released a demo-compilation album entitled Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo on December 18, 2007. The album contains demos of Cuomo's that span from 1992 to 2007, including songs from Weezer's abandoned second album, Songs from the Black Hole. Also included in Alone is a song intended for Weezer's upcoming 6th studio album, entitled ""This is the Way"". The booklet of Alone tells of the band wanting the song for the album, but ultimately choosing ""an epic, 6-minute, symphonic type of art song"" entitled ""Daydreamer"" instead.

Weezer's ""Weezer"" (also referred to as ""The Red Album"") was released in June 2008. Rick Rubin produced the album and Rich Costey mixed it. The record is being described as ""experimental"", and according to Cuomo, includes longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808 drum machines, synthesizers, Southern rap, baroque counterpoint, and band members other than Cuomo writing, singing, and switching instruments. Pat Wilson said that the album cost about a million dollars to make, contrasting it with the $150,000 budget of ""The Blue Album"". The album's singles were produced by Jacknife Lee. Its lead single, ""Pork and Beans"", topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks charts for 11 weeks, and its music video won a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video. The album's second single, ""Troublemaker"", debuted at #39 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaked at #2. In October 2008, the group announced that the third single would be ""The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)"".

In 2009, the band announced their next album, ""Raditude"", would be released on November 3, 2009, where it debuted as the seventh best-selling album of the week on the Billboard 200 chart. The band scheduled tour dates in December 2009 extending into early 2010 to coincide with the new album's release. On December 6, 2009, Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo was injured when his tour bus crashed in upstate New York due to black ice. Cuomo suffered three broken ribs, and his assistant broke two ribs. His wife, baby daughter, and their nanny were also on the bus; however, they escaped injury. Weezer cancelled tour dates the following day. The band resumed touring on January 20, 2010.

In December 2009, it was revealed that the band was no longer with Geffen Records. The band stated that they would still release new material, but they are unsure of the means, whether it be self-released, released online, or getting signed by another label. Eventually, the band was signed to the independent label Epitaph.

The album ""Hurley"" was released in September 2010 through Epitaph Records. The name comes from the character Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes from the television show ""Lost"". Jorge Garcia, the actor who portrayed Hurley, stated that being featured on the album cover is ""one of the biggest honors of [his] career."" Weezer used internet streaming service YouTube as a way to promote the album. Weezer loaned itself to 15 amateur online video producers, ""going along with whatever plans the creator could execute in about 30 minutes."" They have used many of the popular channels to promote themselves, such as Barely Political, Ray William Johnson and Fred Figglehorn. The Gregory Brothers solicited musical and vocal contributions from the band on one of its compositions built around speeches by Rep. Charles Rangel and President Barack Obama. Weezer calls the promotion ""The YouTube Invasion""

On November 2, 2010, Weezer released another studio album called ""Death to False Metal"". This album was composed of newly re-recorded versions of unused recordings spanning the band's career.

On October 9, 2011, the band announced on their website that former bassist Mikey Welsh had died.

The band currently consists of the following members:

    * Brian Bell — guitar, backing vocals
    * Rivers Cuomo — vocals, guitar
    * Scott Shriner — bass guitar, backing vocals (2002-present) (plays on Maladroit and Make Believe)
    * Patrick Wilson — drums

Former members:

    * Jason Cropper — Guitar, left the band in September 1993 (believed to have been fired by Cuomo, although it is not clear as Cropper is forbidden from discussing the issue)
    * Matt Sharp — bass guitar, backing vocals (1992-1997) (plays on The Blue Album and Pinkerton)
    * Mikey Welsh — bass guitar, backing vocals (1998-2001) (plays on The Green Album) <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Weezer"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Johnny Cash,"Johnny Cash (born J.R. Cash, February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was a Grammy Award-winning American country singer and songwriter. 

Cash is widely considered to be one of the most influential American musicians of the 20th century.  Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple induction in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.

Cash was known for his deep, distinctive voice, the boom-chick-a-boom or ""freight train"" sound of his  backing band (Tennessee Two / Tennessee Three), his demeanor, and his dark clothing, which earned him the nickname ""The Man in Black"". He traditionally started his concerts with the introduction ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.""

Much of Cash's music, especially that of his later career, echoed themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption. His signature songs include ""I Walk the Line"", ""Folsom Prison Blues"", ""Ring of Fire"", ""That Old Wheel"" (a duet with Hank Williams Jr.), ""Cocaine Blues"", and ""Man in Black"". He also recorded several humorous songs, such as ""One Piece at a Time"", ""The One on the Right Is on the Left"", ""Dirty Old Egg-Sucking Dog"" and ""A Boy Named Sue""; rock-and-roll numbers such as ""Get Rhythm""; and various railroad songs, such as ""Rock Island Line"" and ""Orange Blossom Special"".

He sold over 90 million albums in his nearly fifty-year career and came to occupy a ""commanding position in music history"".

Early life
Johnny Cash was born J. R. Cash in Kingsland, Arkansas, United States, to Ray and Carrie Cash, and raised in Dyess, Arkansas. He was reportedly given the name ""J. R."" because his parents could not agree on a name, only on initials. Giving children initials-only names, or a first name and middle initial only, was a common practice at the time. When he enlisted in the United States Air Force, the military would not accept initials as his name, so he adopted John R. Cash as his legal name. Then when signing with Sun Records in 1955, he took Johnny Cash as his stage name. His friends and in-laws generally called him John, while his blood relatives often continued to call him by his birth name, J. R.

Cash was one of seven children: Reba Hancock, Jack, Joanne Cash-Yates, Tommy, Roy, and Louise Cash Garrett. His younger brother Tommy Cash also became a successful country artist. By age five, J.R. was working in the cotton fields, singing along with his family as they worked.

The family farm was flooded on at least one occasion, which later inspired him to write the song Five Feet High And Rising. His family's economic and personal struggles during the Depression shaped him as a person and inspired many of his songs, especially those about other people facing similar difficulties.

Cash was very close to his brother Jack, who was two years older. In 1944, Jack was pulled into a whirling table saw in the mill where he worked, and cut almost in two. He suffered for over a week before he died. There was some talk that Jack's death might not have been accidental; a local bully was seen running from the shop with blood on his shirt, shortly before Jack was found. However, Cash did not discuss that theory in his autobiography, nor the report in some circles that Cash made investigation of the incident a personal obsession. Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident. According to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but he and his mother, and Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day, and his mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother. Jack insisted on working, as the family needed the money. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in Heaven. He wrote that he had seen his brother many times in his dreams, and that Jack always looked two years older than whatever age Cash himself was at that moment. It is widely thought that the dark side of his world view was shaped by this traumatic event.

Cash's early memories were dominated by gospel music and radio. Taught by his mother and a childhood friend, Johnny began playing guitar and writing songs as a young boy. In high school he sang on a local radio station. Decades later, he would release an album of traditional gospel songs, called My Mother's Hymn Book. Traditional Irish music that he heard weekly on the Jack Benny radio program, performed by Dennis Day, influenced him greatly.

Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force. After basic training at Lackland Air Force Base and technical training at Brooks Air Force Base, both in San Antonio, Texas, Cash was assigned to a U.S. Air Force Security Service unit at Landsberg, Germany. Assigned as a morse code decoder on Russian Army transmissions, Cash was the first American to discover that Josef Stalin had died.


First marriage
While in Air Force training in 1950, Cash met Vivian Liberto. A month after his discharge, on August 7, 1954, he and Vivian were married. They had four daughters: Rosanne (1955), Kathleen (1956), Cindy (1959), and Tara (1961). However, his constant touring and drug use put intense strain on his marriage, and they divorced in 1966.


Early career
In 1954, the couple moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he sold appliances, while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist Luther Perkins and bassist Marshall Grant. Perkins and Grant were known as the Tennessee Two. Cash worked up the courage to visit the Sun Records studio, hoping to get a recording contract. After auditioning for Sam Phillips, singing mostly gospel songs, Phillips told him to ""go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell."" Cash eventually won over Phillips with new songs delivered in his early frenetic style. His first recordings at Sun, ""Hey Porter"" and ""Cry Cry Cry,"" were released in 1955 and met with reasonable success on the country hit parade.

Cash's next record, Folsom Prison Blues, made the country Top 5, and ""I Walk the Line"" became No. 1 on the country charts, also making it into the pop charts Top 20. Following ""I Walk the Line"" was Johnny Cash's ""Home of the Blues,"" recorded in July 1957. In 1957, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a long-playing album. Although he was Sun's most consistently best-selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Elvis Presley had already left Sun, and Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Jerry Lee Lewis. The following year, Cash left the label to sign a lucrative offer with Columbia Records, where his single ""Don't Take Your Guns to Town"" would become one of his biggest hits.

In the early 60s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included Mother Maybelle's daughters, Anita, June and Helen. June later recalled admiring Johnny from afar, during these tours.


Outlaw Image
As his career was taking off in the early 1960s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to amphetamines and barbiturates. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with Waylon Jennings, who was heavily addicted to amphetamines. Cash used the uppers to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his ""nervousness"" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening drug addiction.

 
Although in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash's frenetic creativity was still delivering hits. His rendition of ""Ring of Fire"" was a crossover hit, reaching No. 1 on the country charts and entering the Top 20 on the pop charts. The song was written by June Carter and Merle Kilgore and originally performed by Carter's sister, but the signature mariachi-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash, who said that it had come to him in a dream. The song describes the personal hell Carter went through as she wrestled with her forbidden love for Cash (they were both married to other people at the time) and as she dealt with Cash's personal ""ring of fire"" (drug dependency and alcoholism).

Cash sometimes spoke of his erratic, drug-induced behavior with some degree of bemused detachment. In June 1965, his truck caught fire due to an overheated wheel bearing, triggering a forest fire that burnt several hundred acres in Los Padres National Forest in California. When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said in his characteristically flippant style at the time, ""I didn't do it, my truck did, and it's dead, so you can't question it."" The fire destroyed 508 acres (2.06 km²), burning the foliage off three mountains and killing 49 of the refuge's 53 endangered condors. Cash was unrepentant: ""I don't care about your damn yellow buzzards."" The federal government sued him and was awarded $125,127. Johnny eventually settled the case and paid $82,001. Cash said he was the only person ever sued by the government for starting a forest fire.

Although Cash carefully cultivated a romantic outlaw image, he never served a prison sentence. Despite landing in jail seven times for misdemeanors, each stay lasted only a single night. His most infamous run-in with the law occurred while on tour in 1965, when he was arrested by a narcotics squad in El Paso, Texas. The officers suspected that he was smuggling heroin from Mexico, but it was prescription narcotics and amphetamines that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case. Because they were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, he received a suspended sentence.

 
Johnny Cash and his second wife, JuneCash was also arrested on May 11, 1965, in Starkville, Mississippi, for trespassing late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (This incident gave the spark for the song ""Starkville City Jail"", which he spoke about on his live At San Quentin prison album.)

The mid 1960s saw Cash release a number of concept albums, including Ballads Of The True West (1965), an experimental double record mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration, and Bitter Tears (1964), with songs highlighting the plight of the Native Americans. His drug addiction was at its worst at this point, however, and his destructive behavior led to a divorce from his first wife and cancelled performances.

In 1967, Cash's duet with Carter, ""Jackson"", won a Grammy Award.

Cash quit using drugs in 1968, after a spiritual epiphany in the Nickajack Cave. June, Maybelle, and Eck Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him defeat his addiction. Cash proposed onstage to Carter at a concert at the London Gardens in London, Ontario on February 22, 1968; the couple married a week later in Franklin, Kentucky. June had agreed to marry Cash after he had 'cleaned up'.  Rediscovering his Christian faith, taking an ""altar call"" in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, Cash chose this church over many larger, celebrity churches in the Nashville area because he said that there he was treated like just another parishioner and not a celebrity.


Folsom Prison Blues
While an airman in West Germany, Cash saw the B movie Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison (1951), which inspired him to write an early draft of one of his most famous songs, ""Folsom Prison Blues"".

Cash felt great compassion for prisoners. He began performing concerts at various prisons starting in the late 1950s. These performances led to a pair of highly successful live albums, Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison (1968) and Johnny Cash at San Quentin (1969).

The Folsom Prison record was introduced by a rendition of his classic ""Folsom Prison Blues,"" while the San Quentin record included the crossover hit single ""A Boy Named Sue,"" a Shel Silverstein-penned novelty song that reached No. 1 on the country charts and No. 2 on the U.S. Top Ten pop charts. The AM versions of the latter contained a couple of profanities which were edited out. The modern CD versions are unedited and uncensored and thus also longer than the original vinyl albums, though they still retain the audience reaction overdubs of the originals.

Apart from his performances at Folsom Prison and San Quentin and various other U.S. correctional facilities, Cash also performed at the Österåker Prison in Sweden in 1972. The live album På Österåker (""At Österåker"") was released in 1973. Between the songs, Cash can be heard speaking Swedish, which was greatly appreciated by the inmates.


""The Man in Black""
 
Cash advocated prison reform at his July 1972 meeting with U.S. president Richard NixonFrom 1969 to 1971, Cash starred in his own television show, The Johnny Cash Show, on the ABC network. The singing group The Statler Brothers opened up for him in every episode. Other notable artists who appeared on his show included Neil Young, Louis Armstrong, James Taylor, Ray Charles and Bob Dylan.

Cash had met with Dylan in the mid 1960s and became closer friends when they were neighbors in the late 1960s in Woodstock, New York. Cash was enthusiastic about reintroducing the reclusive Dylan to his audience. Cash sang a duet with Dylan on Dylan's country album Nashville Skyline and also wrote the album's Grammy-winning liner notes.

Another artist who received a major career boost from The Johnny Cash Show was songwriter Kris Kristofferson. During a live performance of Kristofferson's ""Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down,"" Cash made headlines when he refused to change the lyrics to suit network executives, singing the song with its references to marijuana intact: ""On the Sunday morning sidewalks / Wishin', Lord, that I was stoned.""

By the early 1970s, he had crystallized his public image as ""The Man in Black."" He regularly performed dressed all in black, wearing a long black knee-length coat. This outfit stood in contrast to the costumes worn by most of the major country acts in his day: rhinestone suit and cowboy boots. In 1971, Cash wrote the song ""Man in Black"" to help explain his dress code: ""We're doing mighty fine I do suppose/In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes/But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back/Up front there ought to be a man in black.""

He and his band had initially worn black shirts because that was the only matching color they had among their various outfits. He wore other colors on stage early in his career, but he claimed to like wearing black both on and off stage. He stated that, political reasons aside, he simply liked black as his on-stage color. To this day, the United States Navy's winter blue service uniform is referred to by sailors as ""Johnny Cashes,"" as the uniform's shirt, tie, and trousers are actually solid black in color.

In the mid 1970s, Cash's popularity and number of hit songs began to decline, but his autobiography (the first of two), titled Man in Black, was published in 1975 and sold 1.3 million copies. A second, Cash: The Autobiography, appeared in 1997. His friendship with Billy Graham led to the production of a movie about the life of Jesus, The Gospel Road, which Cash co-wrote and narrated. The decade saw his religious conviction deepening, and he made many public appearances in an evangelical capacity.

He also continued to appear on television, hosting an annual Christmas special on CBS throughout the 1970s. Later television appearances included a role in an episode of Columbo. He also appeared with his wife on an episode of Little House on the Prairie entitled ""The Collection"" and gave a performance as John Brown in the 1985 Civil War television mini-series North and South.

He was friendly with every U.S. President starting with Richard Nixon. He was probably closest with Jimmy Carter, who became a very close friend. None of these friendships were about politics (although he supported the Democratic Party). He stated that he found all of them personally charming, noting the fact that it was probably essential to getting oneself elected.

When invited to perform at the White House for the first time in 1972, President Richard Nixon's office requested that he play ""Okie from Muskogee"" (a Merle Haggard satirical song about the people who disrespected the youthful drug users and war protesters) and ""Welfare Cadillac"" (a Guy Drake song that derides the integrity of welfare recipients). Cash declined to play either song and instead played a series of more left-leaning, politically charged songs, including ""The Ballad of Ira Hayes"" (about a brave Native-American World War II veteran who was racially mistreated upon his return to Arizona), and his own compositions, ""What is Truth?"" and ""Man in Black."" Cash claimed that the reasons for denying Nixon's song choices were not knowing them and having fairly short notice to rehearse them, rather than any political reason.


Highwaymen
 
From left to right Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, who formed the country music supergroup, The HighwaymenIn 1980, Cash became the Country Music Hall of Fame's youngest living inductee at age forty-eight, but during the 1980s his records failed to make a major impact on the country charts, although he continued to tour successfully. In the mid 1980s, he recorded and toured with Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson as The Highwaymen, making two hit albums.

During this period, Cash appeared as an actor in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in The Pride of Jesse Hallam. Cash won fine reviews for his work in this film that called attention to adult illiteracy. In 1983, Cash also appeared as a heroic sheriff in Murder In Coweta County, which co-starred Andy Griffith as his nemesis. This film was based on a real-life Georgia murder case. Cash had tried for years to make the film, for which he won acclaim.

Cash relapsed into addiction after a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an unusual incident in which he was kicked and critically wounded by an ostrich he kept on his farm. He was administered painkillers as part of the recovery process, which led to a return to substance abuse.

At a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent double bypass surgery in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a ""near death experience"". He said he had visions of Heaven that were so beautiful that he was angry when he woke up alive.

Cash's recording career and his general relationship with the Nashville establishment were at an all-time low in the 1980s. He realized that his record label of nearly 30 years, Columbia, was growing indifferent to him and wasn't properly marketing him (he was ""invisible"" during that time, as he said in his autobiography). Cash recorded an intentionally awful song to protest, a self-parody. ""Chicken in Black"" was about Johnny's brain being transplanted into a chicken. Ironically, the song turned out to be a larger commercial success than any of his other recent material. Nevertheless, he was hoping to kill the relationship with the label before they did, and it was not long after ""Chicken in Black"" that Columbia and Cash parted ways.

In 1986, Cash returned to Sun Studios in Memphis to team up with Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins to create the album Class of '55. This was not the first time he had teamed up with Lewis and Perkins at Sun Studios. On December 4, 1956, Elvis Presley dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks, with Lewis backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio and the four started an impromptu jam session. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived and have been released on CD under the title Million Dollar Quartet. Tracks also include Chuck Berry's ""Brown Eyed Handsome Man"", Pat Boone's ""Don't Forbid Me"", and Elvis doing an impersonation of Jackie Wilson (who was then with Billy Ward and the Dominoes) singing ""Don't Be Cruel"".

In 1986, Cash published his only novel, Man in White, a book about Saul and his conversion to become the Apostle Paul. He also recorded Johnny Cash Reads The Complete New Testament in 1990.


American Recordings
 
After Columbia Records dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with Mercury Records from 1987 to 1991 (see Johnny Cash discography).

In 1991, Cash sang lead vocals on a cover version of ""Man in Black"" for the Christian punk band One Bad Pig's album I Scream Sunday.

His career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity among a younger audience not traditionally interested in country music. In 1993, he sang the vocal on U2's ""The Wanderer"" for their album Zooropa. Although he was no longer sought after by major labels, Cash was approached by producer Rick Rubin and offered a contract with Rubin's American Recordings label, better known for rap and hard rock.

Under Rubin's supervision, he recorded the album American Recordings (1994) in his living room, accompanied only by his guitar. The album featured several covers of contemporary artists selected by Rubin and saw much critical and commercial success, winning a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Cash wrote that his reception at the 1994 Glastonbury Festival was one of the highlights of his career. This was the beginning of a decade of music industry accolades and surprising commercial success.

Cash and his wife appeared on a number of episodes of the popular television series Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman starring Jane Seymour. The actress thought so highly of Cash that she later named one of her twin sons after him. He did a cameo in an episode of The Simpsons, playing the voice of a coyote that guides Homer on a spiritual quest. In 1996, Cash released a sequel to American Recordings, Unchained, and enlisted the accompaniment of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, which won a Grammy for Best Country Album. Cash, believing he did not explain enough of himself in his 1975 autobiography Man in Black, wrote another autobiography in 1997 entitled Cash: The Autobiography.


Illness and death
In 1997, Cash was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease Shy-Drager syndrome. The diagnosis was later altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. This illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs. The albums American III: Solitary Man (2000) and American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002) contained Cash's response to his illness in the form of songs of a slightly more somber tone than the first two American albums. The video for ""Hurt"", generally recognized as 'his epitaph', from American IV received particular critical and popular acclaim.

June Carter Cash died of complications following heart valve replacement surgery on May 15, 2003, at the age of seventy-three. June had told Cash to keep working, so he continued to record and even performed a couple of surprise shows at the Carter Family Fold outside Bristol, Virginia. (The July 5, 2003, concert was his final public appearance.) At the June 21, 2003, concert, before singing ""Ring of Fire"", Cash read a statement about his late wife that he had written shortly before taking the stage. He spoke of how June's spirit was watching over him and how she had come to visit him before going on stage. He barely made it through the song. Despite his health issues, he spoke of looking forward to the day when he could walk again and toss his wheelchair into the river near his home.

Less than four months after his wife's death, Johnny Cash died on September 12, 2003, while hospitalized at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. He was 71. He was interred next to his wife in Hendersonville Memory Gardens near his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Cash is survived by his children and 16 grandchildren.

On May 24, 2005, Vivian Liberto, Cash's first wife and the mother of Rosanne Cash, died from surgery to remove lung cancer. It was Rosanne Cash's fiftieth birthday.

In June 2005, his lakeside home on Caudill Drive in Hendersonville, Tennessee, went up for sale by the Cash estate. In January 2006, the house was sold to Bee Gees vocalist Barry Gibb and wife Linda Gibb and titled in their Florida limited liability company for $2.3 million. The listing agent was Cash's younger brother, Tommy Cash. The home was destroyed by fire on April 10, 2007.

One of Johnny Cash's final collaborations with producer Rick Rubin, entitled American V: A Hundred Highways, was released posthumously on July 4, 2006. The album debuted in the #1 position on Billboard Magazine's Top 200 album chart the week ending July 22, 2006. The vocal parts of the track were recorded before Cash's death, but the other instruments were not recorded until about 2005. American VI, an expected final release, has yet to be issued.


Legacy
From his early days as a pioneer of rockabilly and rock and roll in the 1950s, to his decades as an international representative of country music, to his resurgence to fame in the 1990s as a living legend and an alternative country icon, Cash influenced countless artists and left a large body of work. Upon his death, Cash was revered by the greatest popular musicians of his time.

Among Johnny Cash's children, his daughter Rosanne Cash (by first wife Vivian Liberto) and his son John Carter Cash (by June Carter Cash) are notable country-music musicians in their own right.

Cash nurtured and defended artists on the fringes of what was acceptable in country music even while serving as the country music establishment's most visible symbol. At an all-star TNT concert in 1999, a diverse group of artists paid him tribute, including Bob Dylan, Chris Isaak, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and U2. Cash himself appeared at the end and performed for the first time in more than a year. Two tribute albums were released shortly before his death; Kindred Spirits contains works from established artists, while Dressed in Black contains works from many lesser-known artists.

In total, he wrote over a thousand songs and released dozens of albums. A box set titled Unearthed was issued posthumously. It included four CDs of unreleased material recorded with Rubin as well as a Best of Cash on American retrospective CD.

In recognition of his lifelong support of SOS Children's Villages, his family invited friends and fans to donate to that charity in his memory. He had a personal link with the SOS village in Diessen, at the Ammersee-Lake in Southern Germany, near where he was stationed as a GI, and also with the SOS village in Barrett Town, by Montego Bay near his holiday home in Jamaica. The Johnny Cash Memorial Fund was founded and contributions can be made here.

In 1999, Cash received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Johnny Cash #31 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

In a tribute to Cash after his death, country music superstar Gary Allan included the song ""Nickajack Cave (Johnny Cash's Redemption)"" on his 2005 album entitled Tough All Over. The song chronicles Cash hitting rock bottom and subsequently resurrecting his life and career.

For a period of time, there was a museum called the ""House of Cash"", but it is no longer in operation. Highway 31E, Hendersonville's Main Street, is known as ""Johnny Cash Parkway"".

On November 2 – November 4, 2007 the Johnny Cash Flower Pickin' Festival was held in Starkville, Mississippi, the city where Cash had been arrested over 40 years earlier and held overnight at the city jail on May 11, 1965, inspiring Cash to write the song ""Starkville City Jail"". The festival, where he was offered a symbolic posthumous pardon, honored Cash's life and music, and is expected to become an annual event.


Portrayals
In 1998, country singer Mark Collie portrayed Cash for the first time in a short film, ""I Still Miss Someone"". Shot mostly in black and white, it attempts to capture a moment in time for Cash during his darkest years, the mid 1960s.

Walk the Line, an Academy Award-winning biopic about Johnny Cash's lifetime starring Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash (for which she won the 2005 Best Actress Oscar), was released in the U.S. on November 18, 2005 to considerable commercial success and great critical acclaim. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon have won various other awards for their roles, including the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, respectively. They both performed their own vocals in the film, and Phoenix learned to play guitar for his role as Johnny Cash. Phoenix received the Grammy Award for his contributions to the Walk the Line soundtrack.

Ring of Fire, a jukebox musical of the Cash oeuvre, debuted on Broadway on March 12, 2006 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, but closed due to harsh reviews and disappointing sales on April 30, 2006.

Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, a comedy film parodying biopic films such as Walk the Line and Ray, is a close parody of Cash's life and the way he was portrayed in Walk the Line.


Heritage
Cash was completely of Scottish heritage, but he learned this only upon researching his ancestry. After a chance meeting with former Falkland laird, Major Michael Crichton-Stuart, he traced the Cash family tree to eleventh century Fife, Scotland.

He had believed in his younger days that he was mainly Irish and partially Native American (he had been told he was one-quarter Cherokee). Even after learning he had no Native American ancestry, Cash's empathy and compassion for Native Americans was unabated. These feelings were expressed in several of his songs, including Apache Tears and The Ballad of Ira Hayes, and on his album, Bitter Tears.


Lists of accomplishments

Cash received multiple Country Music Awards, Grammys, and other awards, in categories ranging from vocal and spoken performances to album notes and videos.

In a career that spanned almost five decades, Cash was the personification of country music to many people around the world. Cash was a musician who was not tied to a single genre. He recorded songs that could be considered rock and roll, blues, rockabilly, folk, and gospel, and exerted an influence on each of those genres. Moreover, he had the unique distinction among country artists of having ""crossed over"" late in his career to become popular with an unexpected demographic, young indie and alternative rock fans. His diversity was evidenced by his presence in three major music halls of fame: the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame (1977), the Country Music Hall of Fame (1980), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1992). Only thirteen performers are in both of the last two, and only Hank Williams Sr., Jimmie Rodgers, and Bill Monroe share the honor with Cash of being in all three. However, only Cash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the regular manner, unlike the other country members, who were inducted as ""early influences."" His pioneering contribution to the genre has also been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1996. Cash stated that his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1980 was his greatest professional achievement.

In 2007 Johnny Cash was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Foals,"Foals are a rock band which formed in Oxford, England in 2005.  The band consists of Yannis Philippakis (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Smith (guitar), Walter Gervers (bass), Edwin Congreave (keyboards) and Jack Bevan (drums). The band has released four albums: ""Antidotes"" (2008), ""Total Life Forever"" (2010), ""Holy Fire"" (2013) and ""What Went Down"" (2015).

The band was formed in 2005 by Philippakis and Bevan, both former members of math rock band The Edmund Fitzgerald, and Andrew Mears of Youthmovies. Mears left the band after their first single to focus on Youthmovies.

In early 2007, the band released the limited edition 7"" singles Hummer and Mathletics, both produced by Gareth Parton. In the summer of 2007 Foals began working on their debut album in New York. It was produced by Dave Sitek of TV On The Radio, however, the band decided to mix the album themselves, stating that Sitek made the first master copy of the album sound like ""it was recorded in the Grand Canyon"". Yannis has stated multiple times during various interviews that Foals and Dave Sitek are on good terms, even though the copy by Sitek was rejected by the band. 

Foals released their debut album, entitled Antidotes, on 24 March 2008 in the UK and 8 April 2008 in the US. The album was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, debuting at No. 3 in the UK Albums Charts. The album was a minor success in other countries, charting in Japan, France and the Netherlands. Non-UK versions of the album include the early Parton produced singles.

In August 2009, Foals started recording their second album at Svenska Grammofon Studion in Gothenburg, Sweden. The album, Total Life Forever, has been described by the band members as sounding like ""tropical prog"" and ""like the dream of an eagle dying"". The band have described the album as being ""a lot less funk"" than they had originally planned. The album was produced by Luke Smith, formerly of Clor, and its title is named after an element of Ray Kurzweil's theory of singularity. The band's frontman Yannis Philippakis has professed a long time interest in futurology, with it informing numerous songs on Total Life Forever.

On 1 March 2010, the promotional single ""Spanish Sahara"" was first played on Zane Lowe's show Radio 1. Foals' new website was updated that night with the release of a video for the track directed by longtime collaborator Dave Ma. On 6 March, the Total Life Forever site was officially launched. Puzzles revealed images, lyrics and sound clips of songs from the album. The last clip appeared on 12 March, and resulted with a password entry for the Foals' new website. The site was opened on 13 March and presented the whole new art concept and media including samples of songs, photos and videos. Lead single ""This Orient"" was released on 3 May 2010. The album was finally released on 10 May 2010. ""Spanish Sahara"" was later released as a full physical single in September 2010, featuring an edited remix starring the strings of London Contemporary Orchestra. The album was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize.

Fall Out Boy,"Fall Out Boy is a band formed in 2001 in Glenview, Illinois after good friends Joe Trohman and Pete Wentz met high schooler Patrick Stump. Stump originally auditioned as a drummer, but soon became the lead singer. The following year, the band debuted with a self-released demo and followed it up with the May 28, 2002 release of Split EP, which featured Project Rocket, on Uprising Records. The group released a mini-LP, Evening Out With Your Girlfriend, also on Uprising Records, in 2003.

2003–2004: Independent success

After the release of their mini-album, Fall Out Boy built a large cult following playing in the Chicago area and drummer  Andy Hurley, formerly of Racetraitor, joined the band while the two other members left. At this time, Stump also took over rhythm guitar duties. During this time, they played many local shows at the The Knights of Columbus Hall in Arlington Heights, Illinois, also the site of their first video: Dead On Arrival. The same year, after signing to Fueled By Ramen, they released their first full-length album, Take This to Your Grave, on May 6, 2003. The band received an advance from Island Records to record their proper debut, but the advance came with a right of first refusal for Island on Fall Out Boy’s next album. With major financing in place, the recording of Take This to Your Grave took place at producer & Garbage drummer Butch Vig’s Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, with Sean O’Keefe producing.

With singles Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy and Saturday receiving video airplay on FUSE and mtvU and radio airplay on alternative stations across the country, the band soon gained a cult following. With very positive reviews at the South by Southwest Music Festival and an extensive tour schedule, Fall Out Boy’s popularity continued to grow. The album sold very well and eventually achieved gold status, but only after the success of their next album, From Under The Cork Tree.

In mid-2003 the band signed with Island Records, part of the super label The Island Def Jam Music Group along with Def Jam Records. This was after they picked up the option for their next album. While recording their mainstream debut, they released the acoustic EP My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue on Fueled by Ramen, May 18, 2004. It debuted at #153 on the Billboard Top 200, their first entry on the chart. The two-disc set included a DVD with videos, more acoustic performances and a fan photo gallery.

2005–2006: Commercial debut

On May 3, 2005, Fall Out Boy released their major label debut, From Under the Cork Tree, which debuted on the Billboard 200 at #9, selling over 68,000 copies in its first week. The album achieved double platinum status and has sold over 2.5 million albums in the US alone. Earlier that year, the band’s stability was threatened when Wentz overdosed on the sedative Ativan in a failed suicide attempt. The track 7 Minutes In Heaven (Atavan Halen) from their album From Under the Cork Tree is based upon Wentz’s attempted suicide.

Their first single, Sugar We’re Goin’ Down, peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, #6 on the Pop 100 and #3 on the Modern Rock Charts. The video reached #1 on MTV’s TRL, where it was retired on August 26, 2005. The video also won the MTV2 Award at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, prompting a huge new interest and surge in sales. The band was also nominated for “Best New Artist” at the 2006 Grammy Awards.

The second single off the album, Dance, Dance, became their second Top 10 Single when it peaked at #9 on the Hot 100. It also reached #6 on the Pop 100 and became the bands top charted hit when it reached #2 on the Modern Rock Charts. The video for the song premiered on TRL on October 11, 2005; it soon reached #1 and was later retired on January 17, 2006. The third single off the album, A Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More ‘Touch Me’, was much less popular than both prior singles but still managed to peak at #65 on the Hot 100 and hit #1 twice on TRL, retiring on June 6, 2006.

The band headlined the Nintendo Fusion Tour in the fall of 2005, joining The Starting Line, Motion City Soundtrack, Boys Night Out, and Panic! At the Disco on a 31 city tour. Due to their increased success from their MTV Video Music Award, they headlined the Black Clouds and Underdogs Tour—an emo/pop punk event that featured The All-American Rejects, Hawthorne Heights, From First to Last. The tour also featured The Hush Sound for half of the tour and October Fall for half. They played to 53 dates in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

2007: Continuing prosperity

Fall Out Boy’s fourth album, titled  Infinity On High, was released on February 6, 2007. The lead single,  This Ain’t A Scene, It’s An Arms Race, debuted at the 2006 American Music Awards. The video debuted on MTV on Tuesday, December 19, 2006. In the album’s opening week, Infinity on High reached number 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 260,000 copies.

“This Ain’t a Scene, It’s an Arms Race” peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart on February 4, 2007, making it their most successful song in the UK to date. The single also peaked on the U.S. Hot 100 at number 2 and the U.S. Pop 100 at number 1.  The Carpal Tunnel Of Love (the second single released from the album) reached number 81 on the U.S. Hot 100 by way of digital sales alone. Thnks fr th Mmrs was released on April 9, 2007 and made it to #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at #12 on the UK Singles chart.

Fall Out Boy headlined the Honda Civic Tour in 2007 along with +44, The Academy Is…, Paul Wall and Cobra Starship. The tour was originally scheduled to start April 18 and end on June 11. However, due to personal issues, the tour was postponed until May 11, where the first show was played in Denver, Colorado. The tour ended on July 2 in Anaheim, California in the United States and continue on in the United Kingdom.

Showing their versatility, Fall Out Boy has collaborated with rappers Kanye West, Babyface, Jay-Z, and Timbaland and are currently touring with Paul Wall. Babyface produced and Jay Z is featured on Thriller. They also worked with Timbaland on his new album Timbaland Presents Shock Value, where they are featured on the track One and Only, for which Stump and Wentz both contributed in writing. Stump was also featured on two songs with Gym Class Heroes (also signed with Fueled By Ramen), including their #1 Single Cupid’s Chokehold. He also was a guest vocalist on Motion City Soundtrack’s single, Everything Is Alright as well as contributing to If You Could Remember.

The band played the US portion of the Live Earth concerts on July 7, 2007 at New Jersey’s Giants Stadium, along with AFI, Akon, Alicia Keys, Bon Jovi, Dave Matthews Band, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, John Mayer, Kanye West, Kelly Clarkson, KT Tunstall, Ludacris, Melissa Etheridge, The Police, Rihanna, Roger Waters, and the reunited Smashing Pumpkins.

The band toured the world almost constantly in 2007, with gigs throughout the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Europe and Asia.

2008-2009:

On April 1, 2008, Fall Out Boy released their live album, **** Live in Phoenix. The album was recorded in Pheonix on June 22. It contained a studio recording of Micheal Jackson’s Beat It with John Mayer as a guest on the guitar.

On the 18th of March, 2008, Fall Out Boy claimed they would play a gig in Antarctica, to be in the Guinness Book of World Records as the only band to have played in each of the 7 continents within 9 months. However, because of weather conditions they were unable to do so, although they did break the record for most interviews on radio in a 24-hour period, setting the bar at 72.

On December 16th, 2008, Fall Out Boy released their 5th studio album, Folie à Deux (literally meaning “madness shared by two”). The lead single for the album, I Don’t Care was released September 8, 2008.

Fall Out Boy star in 2008 comedy film, ‘Sex Drive’. They make a cameo within the film, playing Fame < Infamy from their album Infinity on High. They also play an acoustic performance of Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy. This is due to the friendship executive producer Seth Green has with the band. The song I Don’t Care from their latest album was featured in the end credits. During the credits there is a clip of Ezekiel and Fall Out Boy arguing over the fact that the Amish fixed Fall Out Boy’s tour bus and all that they got in return was “a five song set” alluding to some form of compensation, which serves as a running gag.

On November 17, 2009, Believers Never Die - Greatest Hits was released, featuring two new songs titled Alpha Dog and From Now On We Are Enemies. Along with the news of the release of the CD we also got some not so great news, Fall Out Boy are currently on a break. ""We're just taking a break and decompressing. We're not putting terms on when we're coming back. We're going to come back when everybody's excited about it and it's fun."" says Pete Wentz to J14 Magazine.

2010-2012: Hiatus

In early 2010 the band entered a state of hiatus, with each member eventually going off to explore their own musical interests. Wentz formed DJ duo Black Cards with singer Bebe Rexha in July 2010, releasing an EP before Rexha quietly left the group in January 2012. Trohman and Hurley started the band The Damned Things with Scott Ian from Anthrax and members of Every Time I Die, releasing their debut album Ironiclast in December 2010.

Stump recorded his debut solo album Soul Punk which was released on July 26, 2011. Despite gaining generally positive reviews, ticket sales were poor with many Fall Out Boy fans unwilling to follow him in his new musical direction. This negative feedback caused Stump to create his blog entry ""We Liked You Better Fat"" in which he honestly aired his feelings, causing Wentz to reach out to him and ultimately begin collborating again musically in February 2012.

2013-Current: Reunion

During 2012, the band reformed and began attempts to reinvent their sound. Sessions were difficult, with early attempts a struggle to produce new material. On February 4, 2013 the band simultaneously announced their reunion, a new single My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up) and the album Save Rock and Roll which was released the following month.

This announcement was immediately followed by a show that night in Chicago, and another at Webster Hall in New York the next day. Since then the band have been playing headlining arenas, concerts and festivals in America, Europe and Asia. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Fall+Out+Boy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Pearl Jam,"Pearl Jam is an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. Since its inception, the band's line-up has included Stone Gossard (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), Mike McCready (guitar), and Eddie Vedder (vocals). The band's fifth and current drummer is Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998.

Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten, in 1991. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos, giving interviews and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having ""spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.""

To date, the band has sold more than 31.5 million records in the U.S, and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to Pearl Jam as ""the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s.""


Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament were members of pioneering grunge band Green River during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner. In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with Malfunkshun vocalist Andrew Wood, eventually organizing the band Mother Love Bone. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the PolyGram record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, Apple, was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a heroin overdose.

Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.

Irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball buddy, San Diego, California singer Eddie Vedder. Vedder was the lead vocalist for a San Diego band, Bad Radio, and worked part-time at a gas station. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. He then recorded the vocals to three of the songs (""Alive"", ""Once"", and ""Footsteps"") in what he later described as a ""mini-opera"" entitled Momma-Son. Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band.

With the addition of Dave Krusen on drums, the band took the name Mookie Blaylock, in reference to the then-active All-Star basketball player. The band played its first official show at the Off Ramp Café in Seattle on October 22, 1990, and soon signed to Epic Records and renamed themselves Pearl Jam. In an early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name ""Pearl Jam"" was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for peyote-laced jam. In a 2006 Rolling Stone cover story however, Vedder admitted that this story was ""total bullshit"", even though he indeed had a great-grandma named Pearl. Ament and McCready explained that Ament came up with ""pearl"", and that the band later settled on ""Pearl Jam"" after attending a concert by Neil Young, in which he extended his songs as improvisations of 15–20 minutes in length.

Pearl Jam entered Seattle's London Bridge Studios in March 1991 to record its debut album, Ten McCready said that ""Ten was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were along for the ride at that time."" Krusen left the band in May 1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation; he was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the ""Alive"" video, Chamberlain left to join the Saturday Night Live band. Chamberlain suggested Dave Abbruzzese as his replacement. Abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting Ten.

Released on August 27, 1991, Ten (named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey number) contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. Ten's musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an ""expansive harmonic vocabulary"" with an anthemic sound. The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard charts. Ten produced the hit singles ""Alive"", ""Even Flow"", and ""Jeremy"". Originally interpreted as an anthem by many, Vedder later revealed that ""Alive"" tells the semi-biographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather, while his mother’s grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father. The song ""Jeremy"" (About this sound sample (help·info)) and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates. Ten stayed on the Billboard charts for more than two years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13x platinum.

With the success of Ten, Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The band was criticized in the music press; British music magazine NME said that Pearl Jam was ""trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets."" Nirvana's Kurt Cobain angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial sellouts, and argued Ten was not a true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads. Cobain later reconciled with Vedder, and they reportedly were on amicable terms before Cobain's death in 1994.

Pearl Jam toured relentlessly in support of Ten. Ament stated that ""essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour,"" adding, ""We told the record company, 'We know we can be a great band, so let's just get the opportunity to get out and play.'"" The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, ""Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it."" Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that ""playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates."" In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on Saturday Night Live and MTV Unplugged and took a slot on that summer's Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, and Ministry, among others. The band contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the 1992 Cameron Crowe film Singles: ""State of Love and Trust"" and ""Breath"". Ament, Gossard and Vedder appeared in Singles under the name ""Citizen Dick""; their parts were filmed when Pearl Jam was known as Mookie Blaylock.

The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for ""Jeremy"", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for ""Black"" in spite of pressure by the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs, despite it being common knowledge that music videos were one of the most vital sales tools any band had in its arsenal. However, Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed the listener from creating their own interpretation of the song stating that ""Before music videos first came out, you’d listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you’d come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression."" ""Ten years from now,"" Ament said, ""I don't want people to remember our songs as videos.""

Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, ""The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy."" Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined. The album set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live. Vs. included the singles ""Go"", ""Daughter"", ""Animal"", and ""Dissident"". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, ""Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut."" He added, ""Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife."" The band decided, beginning with the release of Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts. The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of ""Jeremy"" and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band ""ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans."" During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.

By 1994, Pearl Jam was ""fighting on all fronts"", as its manager described the band at the time. Reporter Chuck Philips broke a series of stories showing that Ticketmaster was gouging Pearl Jam's customers. Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster, refused to waive the service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas in order to perform. Pearl Jam’s efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant collapsed which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmaster’s monopoly. An analysis of journalist Chuck Philips investigative series in a well known legal monograph concluded that it was hard to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmaster’s exclusive contracts with venues and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, “The pervasiveness of Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act.” The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C. Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jam’s testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jam’s manager said he was gratified that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue. The band eventually canceled its 1994 summer tour in protest. After the Justice Department dropped the case, Pearl Jam continued to boycott Ticketmaster, refusing to play venues that had contracts with the company. Music critic Jim DeRogatis noted that along with the Ticketmaster debacle, ""the band has refused to release singles or make videos; it has demanded that its albums be released on vinyl; and it wants to be more like its '60s heroes, The Who, releasing two or three albums a year."" He also stated that sources said that most of the band's third album Vitalogy was completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or the battle with Ticketmaster were to blame for the delay.

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind Vs. and the majority of the tracks for its next album, Vitalogy, were recorded during breaks on the tour. Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time. Producer Brendan O'Brien said, ""Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being polite—there was some imploding going on."" After Pearl Jam finished the recording of Vitalogy, drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott. He was replaced by Jack Irons, a close friend of Vedder and the former and original drummer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 Bridge School Benefit, but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until its 1995 Self-Pollution satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it.

Vitalogy was released first on November 22, 1994 on vinyl and then two weeks later on December 6, 1994 on CD and cassette. The CD became the second-fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that ""thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, Vitalogy stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album."" Many of the songs on the album appear to be based around the pressures of fame. The song ""Spin the Black Circle"", an homage to vinyl records, won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Vitalogy also included the songs ""Not for You"", ""Corduroy"", ""Better Man"", and ""Immortality"". ""Better Man"" (sample (info)), a song originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a ""blatantly great pop song"" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.

The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for Vitalogy, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined in. Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three years. Ament later said, ""We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career."" In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young, whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes. Two songs from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: ""I Got Id"" and ""Long Road"". These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the 1995 EP, Merkin Ball.

Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, ""Making No Code was all about gaining perspective."" Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since Ten, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that ""No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album."" The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination, with Ament stating, ""In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up."" Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles ""Who You Are"" (About this sound sample (help·info)), ""Hail, Hail"", and ""Off He Goes"". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was ""a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time"" and that ""it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band.""



Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between all members of the group, with Ament stating that ""everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band."" On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has ""turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten."" Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code, with Vedder saying, ""What was rage in the past has become reflection."" Yield debuted at number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down the charts. It included the singles ""Given to Fly"" and ""Wishlist"". The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for the song ""Do the Evolution"" from the album, its first music video since 1992. A documentary detailing the making of Yield, Single Video Theory, was released on VHS and DVD later that year.

In April 1998, Pearl Jam once again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron on an initially temporary basis, but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam's 1998 Yield Tour in North America marked the band’s return to full-scale touring. The band's anti-trust lawsuit against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam once again began using Ticketmaster in order to ""better accommodate concertgoers."" The 1998 summer tour was a big success, and after it was completed the band released Live on Two Legs, a live album which featured select performances from the tour.

In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded ""Last Kiss"", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band's 1998 fan club Christmas single. The following year, the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the Kosovo War. The band also decided to include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album, No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees. ""Last Kiss"" peaked at number two on the Billboard charts and became the band's highest-charting single.

Following its full-scale tour in support of Yield, the band took a short break, but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, Binaural. It was drummer Matt Cameron's studio recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of the technique. Binaural was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated that the band members ""were ready for a change."" Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone said, ""Apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except Creed fans, Pearl Jam delve elsewhere."" He added, ""The album reflects both Pearl Jam's longstanding curse of self-importance and a renewed willingness to be experimental or just plain odd."" The album is lyrically darker than the band's previous album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as ""pretty sombre."" Binaural included the singles ""Nothing as It Seems"" (About this sound sample (help·info)), one of the songs featuring binaural recording, and ""Light Years"". The album sold just over 700,000 copies and became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status.

Pearl Jam decided to record every show on its 2000 Binaural Tour professionally, after noting the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they attended and the popularity of bootleg recordings. The band had been open in the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings, and these ""official bootlegs"" were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better quality product for fans. Pearl Jam originally intended to release them to only fan club members, but the band's record contract prevented it from doing so. Pearl Jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through its fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and twice set a record for most albums to debut in the Billboard 200 at the same time.

Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour ended in tragedy on June 30, with an accident at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it was already too late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event. Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.

A month after the European tour concluded, the band embarked on its two-leg 2000 North American tour. On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said that ""playing, facing crowds, being together—it enabled us to start processing it."" On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Vedder took the opportunity to thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years. He noted that ""I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something."" After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released Touring Band 2000 the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.

Following the events of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Vedder and McCready were joined by Neil Young to perform the song ""Long Road"" from the Merkin Ball EP at the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert. The concert, which aired on September 21, 2001, raised money for the victims and their families.

Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as ""a pretty positive one"" and ""very intense and spiritual."" Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, ""There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed."" Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles ""I Am Mine"" and ""Save You"". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as ""Love Boat Captain"". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said ""Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy—a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours."" The track entitled ""Arc"" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.

In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act's ""Bu$hleaguer"", a commentary on President George W. Bush, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had ""impaled"" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's Denver, Colorado show.

In June 2003, Pearl Jam announced it was officially leaving Epic Records following the end of its contract with the label. The band stated it had ""no interest"" in signing with another label. The band's first release without a label was the single for ""Man of the Hour"", in partnership with Amazon.com. Director Tim Burton approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the soundtrack of his new film, Big Fish. After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam recorded the song for him. ""Man of the Hour"", which was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award, can be heard in the closing credits of Big Fish.

The band released Lost Dogs, a two-disc collection of rarities and B-sides, and Live at the Garden, a DVD featuring the band's July 8, 2003 concert at Madison Square Garden through Epic Records in November 2003. In 2004, Pearl Jam released the live album, Live at Benaroya Hall, through a one-album deal with BMG. 2004 marked the first time that Pearl Jam licensed a song for usage in a television show; a snippet of the song ""Yellow Ledbetter"" was used in the final episode of the television series Friends. Later that year, Epic released rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991–2003), a Pearl Jam greatest hits collection spanning 1991 to 2003. This release marked the end of Pearl Jam's contractual agreement with Epic Records.

Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; recordings from the show were compiled for the Live at Easy Street album and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band embarked on a Canadian cross-country tour in September 2005, kicking off the tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician Jon Tester, then playing the Gorge Amphitheater before crossing into Canada. After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a Rolling Stones concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, before closing the tour with a concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam's official website in MP3 form. Pearl Jam also played a benefit concert to raise money for Hurricane Katrina relief on October 5, 2005, at the House of Blues in Chicago, Illinois. On November 22, 2005, Pearl Jam began its first Latin American tour.

The work for Pearl Jam's follow-up to Riot Act began after its appearance on the 2004 Vote for Change tour. The time period between the two albums was the longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date and the new album was its first release for a new label. Clive Davis announced in February 2006 that Pearl Jam had signed with his label, J Records, which like Epic, is part of Sony Music Entertainment (then known as Sony BMG), though J has since folded into RCA Records. The band's eighth studio album, Pearl Jam, was released on May 2, 2006. A number of critics cited Pearl Jam as a return to the band's early sound, and McCready compared the new material to Vs. in a 2005 interview. Ament said, ""The band playing in a room—that came across. There’s a kind of immediacy to the record, and that’s what we were going for."" Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly said that ""in a world full of boys sent to do a man's job of rocking, Pearl Jam can still pull off gravitas."" Current socio-political issues in the United States are addressed on the album. ""World Wide Suicide"", a song criticizing the Iraq War and U.S. foreign policy, was released as a single and topped the Billboard Modern Rock chart; it was Pearl Jam's first number one on that chart since ""Who You Are"" in 1996, and first number one on any chart in the United States since 1998 when ""Given to Fly"" reached number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. Pearl Jam also included the singles ""Life Wasted"" and ""Gone"".

To support Pearl Jam, the band embarked on its 2006 world tour. It toured North America, Australia and notably Europe; Pearl Jam had not toured the continent for six years. The North American tour included three two-night stands opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The band served as the headliners for the Leeds and Reading festivals, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after Roskilde. Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde had nothing to do with ""guts"" but with trust in the audience.

In 2007, Pearl Jam recorded a cover of The Who's ""Love, Reign o'er Me"" for the Mike Binder film, Reign Over Me; it was later made available as a music download on the iTunes Music Store. The band embarked on a 13-date European tour, and headlined Lollapalooza in Grant Park, on August 5, 2007. The band released a CD box set in June 2007, entitled Live at the Gorge 05/06, that documents its shows at The Gorge Amphitheatre, and in September 2007 a concert DVD, entitled Immagine in Cornice, which documents the band's Italian shows from its 2006 tour was released.

In June 2008, Pearl Jam performed as the headline act at the Bonnaroo Music Festival. The Bonnaroo appearance took place amidst a twelve-date tour in the Eastern United States. In July 2008, the band performed at the VH1 tribute to The Who alongside Foo Fighters, Incubus and The Flaming Lips. In the days prior to Election Day 2008, Pearl Jam digitally released through its official website a free documentary film, entitled Vote for Change? 2004, which follows the band's time spent on the 2004 Vote for Change tour.

In March 2009, Ten was reissued in four editions, featuring such extras as a remastering and remix of the entire album by Brendan O'Brien, a DVD of the band's 1992 appearance on MTV Unplugged, and an LP of its September 20, 1992 concert at Magnuson Park in Seattle. It was the first reissue in a planned re-release of Pearl Jam's entire catalog that led up to the band's 20th anniversary in 2011. A Pearl Jam retrospective film directed by Cameron Crowe titled Pearl Jam Twenty was also planned to coincide with the anniversary. In 2011, Vs. and Vitalogy were reissued in the spring time in deluxe form.

Pearl Jam began work for the follow-up to Pearl Jam in early 2008. In 2009, the band began to build on instrumental and demo tracks written during 2008. The band's ninth studio album, Backspacer, its first to be produced by Brendan O'Brien since Yield. Backspacer debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard music charts, the band's first album to do so since No Code in 1996 and has sold 635,000 copies as of July 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The music on the record features a sound influenced by pop and New Wave. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that ""prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun."" Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, ""I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now."" ""The Fixer"" was chosen as the album's first single. Pearl Jam did not re-sign its record deal with J Records, and the band released the album through its own label Monkeywrench Records in the United States and through Universal Music Group internationally. Pearl Jam reached a deal with Target to be the exclusive big-box store retailer for the album in the United States. The album also saw release through the band's official website, independent record stores, online retailers, and iTunes. In an interview McCready revealed that Pearl Jam may finish the Backspacer outtakes in the next six months, and told San Diego radio station KBZT that the band may release an EP in 2010 consisting of those songs, while Vedder instead suggested that the songs may be used for the band's next studio album.

In August 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Virgin Festival, the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival, and played five shows in Europe and three in North America. In October 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Austin City Limits Music Festival. Later in October on Halloween night, the band played in what was the last performance at the Philadelphia Spectrum. An additional leg consisting of a tour of Oceania took place afterwards. In May 2010, the band embarked on a month long tour starting with the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. The tour headed to the East Coast and ended May 21, 2010 at Madison Square Garden in New York. A European tour took place in June and July 2010, where the band performed in Northern Ireland for the first time at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast. In late October 2010, Pearl Jam performed at the 24th Annual Bridge School Benefit Concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. A live album, titled Live on Ten Legs, was released on January 17, 2011. It is compilation of live tracks from their 2003 to 2010 world tours, and is a follow-up to Live on Two Legs, which consisted of songs recorded during their 1998 North American tour.

In March 2011, bassist Jeff Ament told Billboard that the band has 25 songs and they'd be heading into the studio in April to begin recording the follow-up to Backspacer. On May 16, 2011, the band confirmed that they would play the Labor Day weekend at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre, East Troy, Wisconsin, followed by ten shows in Canada.

On September 8, 2011, the band released a new song titled ""Olé"". On November 18, the band released Toronto 9.11.11—a free live album available through the launch of Google Music.

On November 21, 2011, as part of their PJ20 World Tour, Pearl Jam visited Costa Rica for the first time to a 30,000 crowd of fans at the New National Stadium. The following month, the band announced a tour of Europe, which started in June 2012.

On July 11, 2013, the band announced that their tenth studio album Lightning Bolt would be released internationally on October 14, 2013 and on the next day in the United States, along with releasing the first single ""Mind Your Manners"". The band is scheduled to play a two-leg tour in North America during October and November, followed by headlining the Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand in 2014. The second single, ""Sirens"", was released on September 18, 2013. After selling 166,000 copies in its first week, Lightning Bolt became Pearl Jam's fifth album to reach number one on the Billboard 200.

Compared with the other grunge bands of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam’s style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s. Pearl Jam has cited many punk rock and classic rock bands as influences, including The Who, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, Kiss and the Ramones. Pearl Jam’s success has been attributed to its sound, which fuses ""the riff-heavy stadium rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses."" Gossard's rhythm guitar style is known for its sense of beat and groove, while McCready's lead guitar style, influenced by artists such as Jimi Hendrix, has been described as ""feel-oriented"" and ""rootsy.""

Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less catchy. He said, ""I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes."" By 1994’s Vitalogy, the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music. The band’s 1996 album, No Code, was a deliberate break from the musical style of Ten. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism. After 1998’s Yield, which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band's early work, the band dabbled with experimental art rock on 2000’s Binaural and folk rock elements on 2002’s Riot Act. The band’s 2006 album, Pearl Jam, was cited as a return to the band’s early sound. The band's 2009 album, Backspacer, contains elements of pop and New Wave.

Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a ""Jim Morrison-like vocal growl."" Greg Prato of Allmusic said, ""With his hard-hitting and often confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock."" Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal (""Alive"", ""Better Man"") to social and political concerns (""Even Flow"", ""World Wide Suicide""). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, ""Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that.""

While Nirvana had brought grunge to the mainstream in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam quickly outsold them, and became ""the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s"" according to Allmusic. Pearl Jam has been described as ""modern rock radio's most influential stylists – the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like ""Alive"" and ""Even Flow"" just melodic enough to get moshers singing along."" The band inspired and influenced a number of bands, ranging from Silverchair to Puddle of Mudd and The Strokes. The band have also been credited for inspiring the indie rock scene of 90s-era urban Pakistan, that has since evolved into a rich rock music culture in the country.

Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic Jim DeRogatis said in the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it ""proved that a rock band which isn't comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."" Eric Weisbard of Spin said in 2001, ""The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists."" In a 2005 USA Today reader's poll, Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time. In April 2006, Pearl Jam was awarded the prize for ""Best Live Act"" in Esquire's Esky Music Awards. The blurb called Pearl Jam ""the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last."" Pearl Jam's fanbase following has been compared to that of the Grateful Dead's, with Rolling Stone magazine stating that Pearl Jam ""toured incessantly and became one of rock's great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon, true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2.""

When asked about Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, ""I think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren’t always easy, but I think we found a way.""

Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-choice sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. The band has promoted an array of causes, including awareness of Crohn's disease, which Mike McCready suffers from, Ticketmaster venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection, among others. Guitarist Stone Gossard has been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of Pearl Jam's carbon neutral policy, offsetting the band's environmental impact. Vedder has advocated for the release of the West Memphis 3 for years and Damien Echols, a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song ""Army Reserve"" (from Pearl Jam).

The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of the pro-choice movement. In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled ""Reclamation"", which detailed his views on abortion. In an MTV Unplugged concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote ""PRO-CHOICE!"" on his arm in protest when the band performed the song ""Porch"". The band are members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including Choice USA and Voters for Choice.

As members of Rock the Vote and Vote for Change, the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in United States elections. Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, and Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U.S. President. In a Rolling Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, ""I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in.""

Vedder sometimes comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including ""Bu$hleaguer"" and ""World Wide Suicide"", are openly critical of the Bush administration. At Lollapalooza 2007, Vedder spoke out against BP Amoco dumping effluent in Lake Michigan, and at the end of ""Daughter"", he sang the lyrics ""George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home"". In the beginning of the second encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the documentary Body of War, onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in turn introduced Ben Harper, who contributed vocals to ""No More"" and ""Rockin' in the Free World"". The band has since discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the AT&T webcast of the event, and are questioning whether that constitutes censorship. AT&T later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor Davie Brown Entertainment.

Pearl Jam has performed numerous benefit concerts in aid of charities. For example, the band headlined a Seattle concert in 2001 to support the United Nations' efforts to combat world hunger. The band added a date at the Chicago House of Blues to its 2005 tour to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina; the concert proceeds were donated to Habitat for Humanity, the American Red Cross and the Jazz Foundation of America.

In 2011, Pearl Jam was named 2011 Planet Defenders by Rock The Earth for their environmental activism and their large-scale efforts to decrease their own carbon emissions

Grimes,"The electronic musician Claire Boucher was born in 17 March 1988 in Vancouver, Canada and is based in Montreal. Her music is an eclectic mix of styles which she described herself as ""ADD music"", because it shifts frequently and dramatically. She fuses contemporary instrumentation with classical vocal practices.

Boucher was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia. She graduated from Lord Byng Secondary School and studied ballet for 11 years. In 2006, she moved to Montreal, Canada to attend Montreal's McGill University, studying Russian literature and later, neuroscience. During her studies, she began to record and perform under the name Grimes. While in Montreal, she began attending concerts put on by local experimental musicians at Lab Synthèse, a performance space located in an abandoned textile factory. She stopped going to McGill and decided to pursue her long life dream of becoming an electronic musician. 

Her first release was the album Geidi Primes, issued on cassette in 2010 by Arbutus Records. It was followed in the same year by the sophomore album Halfaxa, through Arbutus Records. In 2011, Grimes released a split album with d'Eon titled Darkbloom.

In January 2012, she had signed with record label 4AD. In February 2012, Grimes released her third studio album, Visions. The album incorporates influences as wide as Enya, TLC and Aphex Twin, drawing from genres like New Jack Swing, IDM, New Age, K-pop, Industrial and glitch. 

Visions was met with critical acclaim and featured on many Best Albums of 2012 lists. The Guardian named Visions the second best album of 2012, calling it ""a masterpiece in gonzo pop that is weird, original and derivative at the same time"". The NME ranked the album at number two on its 50 Best Albums of 2012 list, while naming her best known songs ""Oblivion"" and ""Genesis"" the sixth and sixteenth best tracks of 2012, respectively.

Grimes herself cited various musicians as influences, including Skinny Puppy, Nine Inch Nails, Cocteau Twins, How to Dress Well, Swans, Outkast, K-pop, medieval music, industrial music.

Black Sabbath,"Black Sabbath is an English heavy metal band that formed in 1968 in Birmingham, West Midlands, England, United Kingdom, originally comprising Ozzy Osbourne (vocals), Tony Iommi (guitar), Geezer Butler (bass), and Bill Ward (drums). In the early 70s, they were the first to pair heavily distorted, sonically dissonant blues rock at slow speeds with lyrics about drugs, mental pain and abominations of war, thus giving birth to generations of metal bands that followed in their wake. Their name itself taken from a notorious horror film, they are often credited with creating the Heavy Metal genre as well as the doom metal subgenre.

Black Sabbath was formed in Aston, a poor district of Birmingham damaged by bombing during World War II, under the name Polka Tulk Blues Band (soon shortened to “Polka Tulk”), later Earth. Initially a rockin' blues band, Earth moved in a darker direction when the group, especially bassist Geezer Butler, being fans of the black magic novels of Dennis Wheatley, tried to make music to have the same effect as a horror movie or novel. Ozzy Osbourne wrote the lyrics to the second song they wrote together, “Black Sabbath” (the song name was inspired by a 1963 Mario Bava film), and Tony Iommi wrote a riff based on the tritone, sometimes called “Diabolus en Musica” (“the Devil in Music”).

Later in their careers, Geezer Butler would write most of the lyrics to Black Sabbath songs, taking direct inspiration from Ozzy's instrumental ideas. In their Last Supper concert film, the band stated that the song is based on an experience Geezer had one night when he saw a black object at the end of his bed and noticed the next day that an occult book Ozzy had given him was missing. When the band found themselves being confused with another local band called Earth, which had a far lighter sound, they adopted the song title as their new name.

As the band evolved, they added more European folk elements and gothic flourishes to their sound, which was like few groups during their time. Their lyrics dealt with darker issues than most conventional rock. Towards the late 60s, many British bands were into the peace movement and the hippie subculture, whilst Sabbath chose to distinguish themselves by dealing with heavier issues; the occult, war, apocalypse, drugs, and gothic storytelling. Their music conveyed a sense of anger and anti-establishment, the likes of which took previous rowdy vibes from the work of The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Doors, and other such bands into a coarse, almost nihilistic direction.

It was this mix of dark lyrical themes and a slower, ominous sound that made Black Sabbath a significant element in the genre that would later be known as heavy metal. Alongside self-consciously 'heavy' contemporaries such as Iron Butterfly, Led Zeppelin, Steppenwolf, and a few others of the late 60s, Black Sabbath would be massively influential as the years passed. Almost countless bands have covered their work either live or in studio.

Despite their doom-laden image, much of the group’s early material featured acoustic guitars, piano, symphony orchestras, keyboards, and even horns. The band's members strongly resisted labeling as being Satanists or other such things themselves; for example, Ozzy in particular decided to prank occultists setting up outside of one of their dressing rooms by re-arranging their candles to read 'Happy Birthday'. The label of making music dangerously seductive to the young would remain with the group throughout its career and be applied to many later metal groups.

After the band’s first four albums, the group became increasingly psychedelic, experimental, and progressive, leaving much of their dark, metallic roots behind. The last two Osbourne-fronted albums, 'Technical Ecstasy' (1976) and 'Never Say Die!' (1978) left a lot of fans dissatisfied with the band, as drugs and alcohol abuse began to take its toll on each member. Some signs seemed to point to the group's complete collapse.

Osbourne was fired in 1978 for becoming increasingly unstable and unwilling to work with the material that, by this time, Tony Iommi was writing more or less entirely himself. Osbourne started a highly successful solo career in 1980. Still, his personal demons continued to haunt him for decades onward, even as he became one of the most iconic modern vocalists of all time.

In 1979, Tony Iommi recruited former Rainbow members; singer Ronnie James Dio and bassist Craig Gruber. Gruber was recruited because Geezer Butler was unhappy with Osbourne’s departure, and was rumoured to have quit the band. Gruber was dismissed and Geezer rejoined. Black Sabbath’s first album with Dio, Heaven and Hell, proved to be a success, and saw the band’s highest American charting since 1975’s Sabotage. It was on this tour that Dio popularised the “devil horns” hand gesture, which has since become a symbol of heavy metal music in general. The album also marked the inclusion of Quartz’s guitarist-turned-keyboardist Geoff Nicholls (Nicholls has not been consistently credited as an official member, and has always been forced to play live shows from off stage (except on the Seventh Star tour in 1986 where he played on stage) supposedly for aesthetic reasons, but he has co-written many songs and has stayed with Black Sabbath through all subsequent incarnations, until he finally left in 2004. Adam Wakeman, son of Rick Wakeman, took over in 2005). Also during the tour, drummer Bill Ward quit the band for personal reasons (both his parents died within a rather short period, and Ward was struggling with alcoholism and other addictions). Drummer Vinny Appice joined to complete the tour and then record the next album Mob Rules, in which an early version of the title track appeared in the film Heavy Metal.

Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice left the band after supposed disputes concerning the mixing of the live album Live Evil, and pursued a solo career together. Black Sabbath re-enlisted drummer Bill Ward, and, along with ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan (who agreed to join the band whilst heavily intoxicated), released Born Again in 1983. It reached a respectable number two in the U.K. music charts, a success not seen since Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, ten years previously. However, the album was not received particularly fondly by critics or fans alike, and not even by singer Ian Gillan. The tour that followed was to provide a wealth of material for the spoof documentary on rock ‘n’ roll culture, Spinal Tap. Drummer Bill Ward was still recovering from poor health and so did not tour for the Born Again album. Instead, fellow Brummie Bev Bevan, formerly of The Move and the Electric Light Orchestra, took to the drumstool for the tour obligations.

Once the tour was over, Ian Gillan left the band to rejoin his Mk.2 Deep Purple band mates. From here on the line-ups of Black Sabbath changed relentlessly, with Tony Iommi being the only constant member. Between 1986 and 1995 Black Sabbath released 7 studio albums and one live album, including a reunion album with the Mob Rules line-up (1992’s Dehumanizer). The 5 Albums 1987 -1990 & 1994 - 1995 feature 2nd Longest Serving Singer of Black Sabbath Tony Martin, both Headless Cross (1989) & TYR (1990) albums are considered Black Sabbath Classic's by Hardcore fans. In 1997 the original line-up reunited for a proper world tour (as opposed to the one-off Live Aid in 1985, and Costa Mesa gigs on Ozzy’s “Farewell” tour in 1992) and have toured on and off since.

In 2007, the Mob Rules line-up reunited under the banner Heaven & Hell and toured in support of Black Sabbath - The Best of: the Dio Years featuring three new tracks and a release of Black Sabbath Live at the Hammersmith Odeon, 1982. They released a live CD/DVD and released a studio album of entirely new songs in April 2009. Ronnie James Dio died from stomach cancer in 2010, his Heaven & Hell album being the last of his studio performances. Neon Nights: Live at Wacken was released the following year on CD/DVD.

On 11th November 2011, the original line-up of Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward hosted a press conference in which they stated they would be touring once more, their first shows since 2005, and recording their first album together since 1978's Never Say Die! However, the tour was radically reduced in scale as Iommi sought treatment for Lymphoma. In early 2012 Bill Ward publicly stated he would no longer be involved in the upcoming tour and album as he had been offered an ""unsignable contract"". Tommy Clufetos (Ozzy Osbourne, ex-Firewind, ex-Rob Zombie, ex-Alice Cooper) was asked to to join for touring obligations. Black Sabbath selected Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk to record on their nineteenth album ""13"".

VH1’s ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" ranked them second, behind Led Zeppelin. They were inducted into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006.

Aside from being arguably the first heavy metal band, Black Sabbath also directly influenced many later metal sub-genres with their sound and imagery. Examples can be seen especially in doom metal and stoner metal, which are directly descended from Black Sabbath’s original sound, with songs such as “Black Sabbath”, “Into the Void”, “Hand of Doom” and others showcasing Black Sabbath’s staple doom sound. Other sub-genres influenced by Sabbath’s sound also include speed metal and thrash metal on the opposite side, “Paranoid” and “Symptom of the Universe” are considered early examples of these genres. Black Sabbath’s lyrical use of hell, death, Satan and horror as imagery also greatly influenced heavy metal, as these themes are prevalent in nearly all heavy metal sub-genres.

In December 2008 Iommi filed a lawsuit against merchandise company LiveNation for continuing to use the Black Sabbath name and Tony Iommi’s likeness to sell merchandise, even after their contract had ended. On May 26, 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only band member for the full forty one years of the band, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne is seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he has said that he hopes the proceedings will lead to equal ownership among the four original members.

Queens of the Stone Age,"Queens of the Stone Age is a rock band from Palm Desert, California, United States. The band is frequently labeled stoner rock, although they reject the label. They developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy music which the band's founder and mastermind Josh Homme described as ""robot rock"", saying that he ""wanted to create a heavy sound based on a solid jam, just pound it into your head"". Since then, their sound has evolved to incorporate a variety of different styles and influences.

While in high school, Homme got together with locals Brant Bjork, Chris Cockrell (later replaced by Nick Oliveri) and John Garcia resulting in the formation of Kyuss (firstly known as ""Sons of Kyuss""). Queens of the Stone Age formed in 1997, rising from the ashes of Kyuss and began playing together during the now legendary Desert Sessions. Homme has drawn all of the members from that diverse group of musicians for Queens of the Stone Age. The band originally formed under the name Gamma Ray, but almost faced a lawsuit from the European metal band of the same name.

Queens of the Stone Age have gone through many line-up changes since first breaking into the hard rock scene. Their most recent line-up includes: Josh Homme (guitar, vocals), Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboards, backing vocals), Jon Theodore (drums, percussion), Michael Shuman (bass, backing vocals), and Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals).

Former core members include Joey Castillo, Alain Johannes, Natasha Shneider, Mark Lanegan, and Nick Oliveri, among other members and contributors. In 2002, regarding the band line-up, Homme said: ""It really is more of a musical experiment… It keeps moving and reinventing itself. That way we never get painted into a corner.""

Dave Grohl recorded drums, percussion and backing vocals on Songs for the Deaf and toured in support of the album in 2002 before returning to the Foo Fighters. Grohl also made a live appearance in 2007, to play Make It wit Chu, and recorded tracks on …Like Clockwork, following Joey Castillo's departure.

Mark Lanegan has long been an on/off vocalist for the band, toured from 2001 to 2005 and made live appearances in 2007 and 2010. He has recorded with the band on all albums except for their self-titled debut album. Lanegan has also played keyboards in live performances during the tour preceding the release of Lullabies to Paralyze, before Natasha Shneider joined the band.

Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri  were seen as the only two consistent Queens of the Stone Age members. Oliveri had previously played alongside Homme in the band Kyuss and joined Queens of the Stone Age as its permanent bass guitarist and co-lead vocalist, in 1998, upon the release of its debut album, Queens of the Stone Age. Being friends since childhood, the two meshed well together. Oliveri's punk background brought an element of danger and attitude to the Queens' live shows.  As the band's two core members, the duo recorded the breakthrough albums, Rated R and Songs for the Deaf, together. Oliveri's unique ""howling"" singing style made him easily distinguishable on songs such as Six Shooter from the album Songs for the Deaf; he also displays a more melodic singing style in Rated R songs such as Auto Pilot.

However, Homme fired Oliveri in 2004 for excessive partying and an alleged incident of domestic abuse (an accusation which Oliveri strongly denies). The duo repaired their friendship shortly afterwards. Oliveri, however, did not return to the band. In 2013, upon hearing that former contributor Dave Grohl was recording drums for the band's sixth studio album, …Like Clockwork, Oliveri asked Homme if he too could return on bass guitar. Homme ultimately did not grant Oliveri's request. He does, however, appear on backing vocals on the album track, If I Had a Tail.

Creedence Clearwater Revival,"Creedence Clearwater Revival (sometimes shortened to Creedence or CCR) was an American rock band that gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a number of successful singles drawn from various albums. The band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter  John Fogerty, his brother and rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford. Their musical style encompassed country rock and swamp rock genres; it remains a staple of radio airplay worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and were ranked at 82 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.

The band started out as The Blue Velvets, formed by John Fogerty, Doug Clifford, and Stu Cook in El Cerrito, California, United States in the late 1950s. They were an instrumental trio, however during the early '60s they began backing Tom Fogerty, John's older brother, for school dances at El Cerrito High School, on fraternity house gigs and in the recording studio. By the mid 1960s, the band signed a contract with Fantasy Records which was a local label based in San Francisco at that time. They were attracted to the label because Fantasy had released a national hit by Vince Guaraldi, ""Cast Your Fate To The Wind"". Fantasy officials changed the group's name to The Golliwogs, an apparent reference to a once-popular minstrel doll called a Golliwogg. Seven singles were released in the San Francisco Bay area, but none received national attention (however, in 1975 Fantasy released Pre-Creedence, a compilation album of recordings by The Golliwogs).

Eventually John Fogerty took control of the group, writing most of their material and singing lead vocals. The band's first album as Creedence Clearwater Revival was released in 1968. A cover of the Dale Hawkins Swamp Rock classic ""Suzie Q."" became their first hit single (the song was later featured in the movie Apocalypse Now). As a result, Creedence Clearwater Revival is considered part of that distinctly American Swamp Rock music, exemplified again most prominently in their song ""Born On The Bayou"".

By 1969, the band really began to find its voice; ""Proud Mary"" became their second hit single and also was a big hit for Ike and Tina Turner. It was followed by a series of successful songs, including ""Bad Moon Rising"", ""Green River"", ""Down on the Corner"", ""Travelin' Band"", ""Who'll Stop the Rain?"", ""Have You Ever Seen the Rain?"", ""Up Around the Bend"", ""Fortunate Son"", and ""Lookin' Out My Back Door.""

Due to John Fogerty's success as writer, singer, and frontman, the other band members began to feel like they were being held back. His brother Tom left the band in 1971, to pursue an unsuccessful solo career. John Fogerty insisted that bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on the band's final album Mardi Gras in 1972. Many have speculated that Fogerty did this in anticipation of poor sales, in order to prove to brother Tom (and the rest of world) that his songwriting had always been the real commercial talent behind the band's success. The album did indeed receive poor reviews and sales, and the group disbanded shortly afterwards.

John Fogerty bought himself out of his contract with Fantasy Records and eventually established a successful solo career.

In 1990, Tom Fogerty died of AIDS, which he contracted from a blood transfusion.

CCR was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. At the induction, Tom Fogerty's widow brought the urn containing his ashes for a CCR ""reunion,"" but John Fogerty would not perform with his fellow bandmates.

Band members Doug Clifford and Stu Cook formed a band in 1995 with other musicians called Creedence Clearwater Revisited. They perform globally, only performing the original band's classics. John Fogerty still has no communications with Cook and Clifford.

Creedence Clearwater Revival was somewhat unfashionable during the time they were active, because they concentrated on tightly-focused, well-crafted singles rather than long, loose album cuts. However within a few years of their breakup their legacy became secure as one of the great American rock bands, and they heavily influenced the entire genre of heartland rock.

Fogerty's songs are considered classics of the rock form and have been covered by countless artists; ""Fortunate Son"" in particular is revived whenever America goes to war. A new live version of ""Fortunate Son"" by John Fogerty was recently released as part of his 2005 compilation album The Long Road Home which combines both his Creedence and solo hits.

""The guitar solos on such songs as ""Suzie Q"", ""Heard it Through the Grapevine"" and ""I Put A Spell On You"" are believed to be played by Steve Cropper of Booker T & the MGs."" This assertion seems to be a strange entry by an unknown commentator, it seems unlikely indeed considering the obvious prowess of John Fogerty as a Guitar player, his subsequent solo playing on ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"", ""Gloomy"", ""The WorkingMan"" and many others.

John recently (2008) released a new album entitled Revival  receiving a Grammy nomination.   

CCR holds the record for the group with the most # 2 songs on the U.S. Charts yet amazingly they never had a # 1 hit.

Sufjan Stevens,"Sufjan Stevens (pronounced ""SOOF-yahn""; born July 1, 1975) is an American musician, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist from Petoskey, Michigan. He is known for his lyrically focused and instrumentally rich songs that often relate to faith and family. He has enjoyed wide critical success in the United States. He is considered part of the folk revival through indie pop, but his influences are very broad, including experimental electronic music, the jazz of Vince Guaraldi, and the academic minimalism of Steve Reich and Philip Glass. 

Though Stevens had announced plans to make an album for each of the 50 U.S. states, beginning the series with the albums 'Michigan' (2003) and Come On Feel The Illinoise!' (2005, officially named just 'Illinois'), he has since then somewhat retracted the statement. ""Sufjan Stevens is not going to write a record for each of the 50 states after all"" was the original text included on the online liner notes for 'Mews Too: An Asthmatic Kitty Compilation' , a disc released on February 7, 2006. This statement was possibly included as a joke, as the text has since been removed and the current liner notes related to Sufjan Stevens reads: ""Sufjan Stevens can fold a fitted-sheet (he once worked as a professional folder in a commercial Laundromat)."" 

Background

Stevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in the city of Petoskey in that same state. He attended Hope College on the west coast of Michigan.

The name Sufjan is an Arabic/Persian name that predates Islam and most famously belonged to Abu Sufyan, a figure from early Islamic history. It has been mentioned in the press that the name was given to Stevens by the leader of Subud, a spiritual sect to which his parents belonged when he was born. Stevens has stated that the name is of Armenian origin and means ""comes with a sword,"" and that it is ""a charming militaristic Muslim name."" In fact the name is not Armenian, and Armenia is a predominantly Christian country.
Sufjan is also the plural form of Sufi in Persian . Sufi is a practitioner of Sufism .This word is frequently used in the old Persian literature ,specially Sufi poetry .  

His brother, marathonist Marzuki Stevens, has trained to compete in the 2008 Olympic trials, and has played on two of Sufjan's albums.

A multi-instrumentalist, Stevens plays the banjo, guitar, drums, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums through the use of multi-tracking. While in school, he studied the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums; he is one of the few musicians in popular music to use these instruments.

Career

Sufjan Stevens began his musical career as a member of Marzuki, a folk-rock band from Holland, Michigan. He also played (and continues to play) various instruments for Danielson Famile. While in school at Hope College, Stevens wrote and recorded his debut solo album, A Sun Came, which he released on Asthmatic Kitty Records, a record label he founded with his step-father in 1999. He later moved to New York City, where he was enrolled in a writing program at the New School for Social Research.

While in New York, Stevens composed and recorded the music for his second album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, a song cycle based around the animals of the Chinese Zodiac that ventured into electronica.

Stevens followed this with the first of his 50 states albums, a collection of folk songs and instrumentals inspired by his home state of Michigan. The result, the expansive Michigan, included odes to cities including Detroit and Flint, the Upper Peninsula, and vacation areas such as Tahquamenon Falls. Melded into the scenic descriptions and characters are his own declarations of faith in God, sorrow, love and the regeneration of Michigan.

Following the release of Michigan, Stevens compiled a collection of songs recorded previously into a side project, the Christian folk album Seven Swans, which was released in March 2004.

Next he released the second in the 50 states projects, entitled Come On Feel The Illinoise!. Among the subjects explored on Come On Feel The Illinoise! are the cities of Chicago, Decatur and Jacksonville, the serial killer John Wayne Gacy, the poet Carl Sandburg, and Mississippi Palisades State Park.

He has contributed to the music of Denison Witmer, Soul Junk, Half-handed Cloud, Brother Danielson, Danielson Famile, Serena Maneesh, Castanets, and Liz Janes. He played piano on for fellow Brooklyn musician's The National's album 2007 Boxer. A cover of ""She Is"" is included on the album Dream Brother, released in the United States on January 31, 2006.

Sufjan contributed a lot to the sound of the 2001 Liz Janes album Done Gone Fire as he engineered, recorded, produced and arranged it as well as playing many addition instruments.

Sufjan recently recorded with Rosie Thomas and Denison Witmer playing banjo and providing vocals. It is unknown how this record will be released. In April 2006, Pitchfork erroneously announced that Stevens and Thomas were having a baby together, but were forced to print a retraction. Witmer and Thomas later admitted it was an April Fools' prank.

The Fifty States Project

Beginning with Michigan, Stevens announced an intent to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. states, although in interviews he wavers between utter sincerity and self-deprecating irony when describing the idea.

Stevens spent the second half of 2004 researching and writing material for the second of these projects, this time focusing his efforts on Illinois. As with Michigan, Stevens used the state of Illinois as a leaping-off point for his more personal explorations of faith, family, love, and location. 

The widely acclaimed Come On Feel The Illinoise! was the highest rated album of 2005 on the Metacritic review aggregator site, based on glowing reviews from Pitchfork, The Onion A/V Club, Spin, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and The Guardian. The 2006 PLUG Independent Music Awards awarded Stevens with the Album Of The Year, Best Album Art/Packaging, and Male Artist Of The Year. Pitchfork Media and Paste Magazine named Come On Feel The Illinoise! as the editors' choice for best album of 2005 and Stevens received the 2005 Pantheon prize, awarded to albums selling 500,000 copies or fewer, for Come On Feel The Illinoise!. In April of 2006, Stevens announced that 21 pieces of music he had culled from the Come On Feel The Illinoise! recording sessions would be incorporated into a new album, called The Avalanche. The album was released on July 11, 2006.

The next states to be taken on in the project have been reported as Oregon and Rhode Island. Minnesota may be another candidate; in late 2005 and early 2006 Stevens played a new instrumental track titled ""The Maple River."" The Maple River mentioned in the title of the song runs through several counties in southern Minnesota. Sufjan also recorded ""The Lord God Bird""—a song about the ivory-billed woodpecker rediscovered in Arkansas (known as the 'lord god' or 'great god' bird because of its breathtaking appearance)—in connection with a National Public Radio piece in which ""independent radio producers Dan Collison and Elizabeth Meister were curious about how Stevens writes his songs.""

Religious themes

Many of Stevens' songs have religious and spiritual allusions, but his album Seven Swans has the most direct religious references. Stevens has expressed that he is Christian, but does not overtly advertise this aspect of himself in his music. Stevens has also stated that he does not try to make music ""with a message"", or music for the sake of preaching. ""I don't think music media is the real forum for theological discussions,"" says Stevens. ""I think I've said things and sung about things that probably weren't appropriate for this kind of forum. And I just feel like it's not my work or my place to be making claims and statements, because I often think it's misunderstood.""

The songs 'Abraham', 'Seven Swans', 'To Be Alone With You', 'We Won't Need Legs To Stand' and 'The Transfiguration' directly address Christianity on the album Seven Swans. In 'Abraham', Sufjan recounts the Old Testament story in the Book of Genesis when Abraham, ordered by God as a test of faith, leads his son, Isaac, up a mountain and prepares to kill him, as commanded (but before God sends an angel to intervene). The lyrics of 'The Transfiguration' follow the Biblical accounts of Jesus' Transfiguration in Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9: 1-8, and Luke 9:28-36.

Michigan and Come On Feel The Illinoise! are packed with Christian references and metaphors. Michigan contains ""Sleeping Bear, Sault Saint Marie"", which implores ""Oh Lamb of God! Tell us Your perfect design and give us the rod"" (""Lamb of God"" being a Biblical name for Jesus Christ). The song ""Oh God, Where Are You Now?"" asks God to ""hold me now"", to ""save somehow"", searching for God in the midst of personal turmoil. ""There's no other man who could save the dead,"" the song states. The album closer, 'Vito's Ordination Song', was apparently originally written for Sufjan's friend Vito Aiuto, and its lyrics allude directly to Psalm 139 (""I always knew you. In your mother's arms, I have called your name"", ""I've made a crown for you""). The song speaks of ""When the bridegroom comes"" - the New Testament speaks of Jesus Christ as being the Bridegroom and the Church His Bride, finally being united together at the End of Time.

Come On Feel The Illinoise! features the song 'Chicago' with its refrain of ""You came to take us, to recreate us"", and 'Decatur' has the chorus of ""It's the great I Am"" (""I Am"" being the name the Lord reveals Himself by to Moses in Exodus 3:14). ""Casimir Pulaski Day"" speaks of ""All the glory that the Lord has made"" in the midst of personal pain and loss. ""The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out To Get Us!"" has the lyrics: ""Lamb of God, we sound the horn. Hallelujah!"" One instrumental passage has the title of ""In This Temple as in the Hearts of Man for Whom He Saved the Earth"". ""The Seer's Tower"" speaks of Emanuel, ""With His sword, with His robe He comes dividing man from brothers"" (an interesting side note is that ""Sufjan"" actually means ""comes with a sword""). Indeed, the vast majority of songs of Come On Feel The Illinoise! contain lyric lines which can be readily identified as having a basis in Stevens' faith in Christ.

Sufjan's second, electronic album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, contains a song cycle based on of the animals of the Chinese Zodiac, culminating with the song ""Year of our Lord"". Stevens released the original, Christian-themed song ""God'll Ne'er Let You Down"" on the ""To Spirit Back the Mews"" compilation on Asthmatic Kitty. The officially unreleased Christmas albums Sufjan Stevens made and then compiled into Songs for Christmas feature suitably Christmas and Christian themed music, both originals and covers of hymns and traditional songs.

Trivia

On Snow Patrol's 2006 album Eyes Open there is a reference to Sufjan and the song ""Chicago"" in the song ""Hands Open"" - ""Put Sufjan Stevens on and we'll play your favorite song/""Chicago"" bursts to life and your sweet smile remembers you.""

They thought it was a spaceship or UFO first, then an eagle or a dragon. Finally they realized it was a giant wasp. He wrote the song ""The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!"" about the incident and mentioned that the reason they (the band) all have wings on stage is to overcome his fear of flying things.

Franz Ferdinand,"Franz Ferdinand is a Scottish rock band that formed in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, in 2002 and played an important part in the post-punk revival of the 2000s. The band is composed of Alex Kapranos (lead vocals and guitar), Bob Hardy (bass guitar), Nick McCarthy (rhythm guitar, keyboards and backing vocals) and Paul Thomson (drums, percussion and backing vocals).

The band first experienced chart success when their second single ""Take Me Out"" reached #3 in the UK Charts, followed by their debut album Franz Ferdinand which entered the UK album chart at #3. The band went on to win the 2004 Mercury Music Prize and two BRIT Awards in 2005 for Best British Group and Best British Rock Act. NME named Franz Ferdinand as their Album of the Year. From the album, three top-ten singles were released, ""Take Me Out"", ""The Dark of the Matinée"" and ""This Fire"". The band has also received several Grammy Award nominations.

The band is named after Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria whose assassination was one of the main reasons for the start of the First World War. The band decided on the name after seeing a racehorse named Archduke Ferdinand win the Northumberland Plate in 2001, eventually coming to the decision as the alliteration and sound of the name appealed to them.

The Smashing Pumpkins,"The Smashing Pumpkins are an alternative rock band, formed in Chicago, Illinois, USA, in 1988. Billy Corgan and James Iha met in a record store, and began performing in local nightclubs with their bassist, D'arcy Wretzky, using a drum machine. Playing with a drum machine frustrated both the band and their audience, and so Chicago jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was hired soon afterwards.

Less influenced by punk than many of their contemporaries, the Pumpkins had a densely layered, guitar-heavy sound, with powerful loud-to-soft-to-loud transitions, while still picking up grunge, heavy metal, power pop, psychedelic rock, shoegaze-style production.

In later recordings, namely Adore, the fourth album, an electronica flair filtered in after Jimmy Chamberlin temporarily left the band for drug rehab. Though  Jimmy Chamberlin returned for their fifth album, Machina/The Machines of God, electronica undertones remained. The emotional tone of bandleader Billy Corgan's songs ranged from angry (X.Y.U.) to dour (Disarm) to jubilant (Cherub Rock).

Selling more than 18.3 million albums in the United States alone (as of 2006),  The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, diminishing sales, drug problems, cultural vitality, and what is speculated to be improper treatment from their record company, hampered the band in their later years, leading to the 2000 break-up.

Prior to the complete dissolution of the original line-up, their final tour (dubbed ""Sacred and Profane""), featured former Hole bassist Melissa Auf Der Maur to fill in the gap left by D'arcy Wretzky, who left in September of 1999. Besides touring with the band she also appeared in the videos accompanying ""Machina/The Machines of God"".

The band's final album, ""MACHINA II / The Friends And Enemies of Modern Music"" was unofficially released on vinyl in 2000, prior to their break-up, with the record company refusing to back the band with a pressing. Only 25 vinyl copies were made, each signed by the band. The album was then released across various fan sites by those who received the album and transferred it digitally, as a final tribute to the band's supporters.

Problems have been seen since then with Billy Corgan, James Iha (who later joined A Perfect Circle), and D'arcy Wretzky, both of whom started their own record company Scratchie Records.

Billy Corgan would continue from there first forming the band Zwan with members Matt Sweeney, Paz Lenchantin, David Pajo, and Jimmy Chamberlin. After a bad breakup shortly after their debut album Mary Star Of The Sea Billy turned solo and released the album TheFutureEmbrace. Jimmy Chamberlin formed the Jimmy Chamberlin Complex, and Corgan recorded vocals for them on the track entitled Loki Cat.

In mid-april 2006 The Smashing Pumpkins ""reunited"" with original members Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin . They performed live as The Smashing Pumpkins for the first time in 6 and a half years on May 22, 2007 in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new members Jeff Schroeder, Ginger Reyes and Lisa Harriton who took over rhythm guitarist, bassist and keyboard duties respectively. 

The new line-up's first studio album, titled ""Zeitgeist"", was released on July 10, 2007 to mixed reviews. It debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, and in the top ten for several other countries.

On Jan 2, 2008 the Pumpkins released the American Gothic EP exclusively on iTunes as part of an expanded version of Zeitgeist.  The four tracks:  ""The Rose March"", ""Again Again Again (The Crux)"", ""Pox"", and ""Sunkissed"" demonstrate a more acoustic sound when compared to the rest of Zeitgeist.

In March, 2008 the group contributed the song ""Superchrist"" to a compilation CD released by Guitar Center. Though Corgan and Chamberlin have continued to record as a duo, Jeff Schroeder indicated that he might be contributing to future recordings. No longer signed to a record label, Corgan and Chamberlin purchased a recording studio in Chicago and began recording in May, again, as a pair. The band released the single G.L.O.W. on October 1st of 2008.

On March 20, 2009, it was announced Jimmy Chamberlin had left the band, leaving Billy Corgan the only original member left in the band. It is reported Corgan plans to continue using the Smashing Pumpkins name and return to the studio to make new music.

On August 17th, 2009, Mike Byrne was confirmed as the new Smashing Pumpkins drummer.

Formally announced by the frontman Billy Corgan on September 16, 2009, the 44-song concept album Teargarden by Kaleidyscope will be released over the Internet, from the band's official website for free, one song at a time. Available for download so far are: ""A Song for a Son"" from December 8, 2009; and ""Widow Wake My Mind"" from January 18, 2010.

The Clash,"The Clash were a punk rock band from London, England, United Kingdom, active from 1976 to 1985. One of the most successful and iconic bands from the first wave of punk in the 70s, they incorporated rock and roll, reggae, rockabilly, and eventually many other music styles into their repertoire. They were legendary for their uncommonly intense stage performances.

From their earliest days as a band, The Clash stood apart from their peers with their musicianship as well as their lyrics, the passionate, left-wing political idealism in the lyrics by frontman Joe Strummer and guitarist Mick Jones contrasting with the lyrical nihilism of the Sex Pistols and the musical minimalism of the Ramones. Their 1979 album 'London Calling' is considered by critics as one of the greatest albums in the history of rock music. Rolling Stone declared it the best album of the 80s, even though it was released near the end of 1979 at first (technically, Jan 1980, in the United States).

The Clash's attitude and style, as much as their music, has influenced countless bands, both within and outside the sphere of punk rock. Often lauded as ""the only band that matters,"" The Clash were canonized as rock saints even before they broke up. This was officially confirmed in 2003, when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their five big albums from their heyday ('The Clash', 'Give 'Em Enough Rope', 'London Calling', 'Sandinista!', and 'Combat Rock') continue to earn a great deal of interest from rock fans into the new millennium.

Mick Jones went on to form Big Audio Dynamite after being fired from The Clash, and he more recently has produced albums by artists such as The Libertines and Babyshambles. In 2004, he formed Carbon/silicon with musician Tony James (of Generation X and Sigue Sigue Sputnik fame). Exploring various genres such as alternative rock and electronic music, he continues to collaborate with other modern groups such as Gorillaz.

Joe Strummer went on to form and front Joe Strummer and the Latino Rockabilly War and then Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. He also had a notable solo career that involved work in films and other endeavors, often earning critical acclaim. He died on December 22, 2002, the victim of an un-diagnosed congenital heart defect. Mourned by countless punk fans, his life has been subject to several tributes and was memorialized in the 2007 documentary 'Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten'.

Bass player Paul Simonon went on to form Havana 3 A.M., a group that released a self-titled album in 1991, yet he decided to quit music in the early 90s in favour of becoming an artist. In 2006, he returned to music as bass player in a musical project together with singer-songwriter Damon Albarn. The project is often referred to as The Good, The Bad & The Queen, the name of the groups first recorded album that came out in 2007. In terms of his paintings, his well-received work notably was in an exhibition at Thomas Williams Fine Art in London.

Drummer Topper Headon released a solo album, 1986's 'Waking Up', before leaving the music business to become a taxi driver and escape the heroin addiction that cost him his legacy in The Clash. Over the years, he's had sporadic involvement in various music-related endeavors, such as being a key part of the aforementioned 'The Future Is Unwritten' film. He's currently residing in the seaside town of Dover, England.

Amy Winehouse,"Amy Jade Winehouse (born 14 September 1983 in Southgate, London, died 23 July 2011 in Camden, London) was an English singer and composer, known for her eclectic mix of various musical genres including soul, jazz, rock 'n' roll and Rhythm and Blues.

Her musical formation went through listening to such jazz divas as Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan; she was later influenced by contemporary metropolitan popular music as well. She represented a union of these aesthetics: a happy fusion of '40s jazz, '60s soul and hard texts inspired by daily life.

Winehouse's 2003 debut album Frank did well - both commercially and critically - in her native Britain and was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize. Her 2006 follow-up album Back to Black led to six Grammy Award nominations and five wins, tying the record for one of the most wins by a female artist in a single night, and made Winehouse the first singer from the United Kingdom to win five Grammys. On February 14, 2007, she won a BRIT Award for Best British Female Artist; she had also been nominated for Best British Album. She has won the Ivor Novello Award three times, once in 2004 for Best Contemporary Song (musically and lyrically) for ""Stronger Than Me"", once in 2007 for Best Contemporary Song for ""Rehab"", and once in 2008 for Best Song Musically and Lyrically for ""Love Is a Losing Game"".

Winehouse received significant media attention for aspects of her life other than her singing. Her distinctive style, most notably her signature beehive hairstyle, has spawned imitators and been the muse for fashion designers such as Karl Lagerfeld. Her drug and alcohol addiction, as well as her self-destructive behaviour, have become regular tabloid fodder since 2007.

She was found dead at her Camden flat on 23 July, 2011. She was 27 at the time of her death. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Winehouse"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
The Lumineers,"The Lumineers are a folk rock trio which formed in Denver, Colorado, United States in 2002. The band consists of Wesley Schultz (vocals, guitar), Neyla Pekarek (piano, cello, mandolin, vocals) and Jeremiah Fraites (drums, vocals). The band's debut self-titled album was released on April 3, 2012. The album's first single, ""Ho Hey"" reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.

The Ho Hey Songfacts reports that Schultz and Fraites were originally based in New York and started collaborating in 2002 after Fraites’ brother, Josh, who was also Schultz’s best friend died of an overdose. The pair began writing and performing to cope with their grief and they later relocated to Denver, where they met the classically trained Pekarek after advertising for a cellist. 

A Denver, Colorado based group. The roots revival of the last few years has primed listeners for a new generation of rustic, heart-on-the-sleeve music—the kind that nods to tradition while setting off into uncharted territory. The Lumineers walk that line with an unerring gift for timeless melodies and soul-stirring lyrics.

Keys released her first studio album, Songs in A Minor, in June 2001. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 236,000 copies in its first week. The album sold over 6.2 million copies in the United States, where it was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It went on to sell over 13 million copies worldwide, establishing Keys' popularity both inside and outside the United States, where she became the best-selling new artist and best-selling R&B artist of 2001. The album's lead single, Fallin', spent six weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album's second single, A Woman's Worth, peaked at number three on the same chart. The following year, the album was reissued as Remixed & Unplugged in A Minor, which included eight remixes and seven unplugged versions of the songs from the original.

Songs in A Minor led Keys to win five awards at the 2002 Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song for Fallin', Best New Artist, and Best R&B Album; Fallin' was also nominated for Record of the Year. Keys became the second female solo artist to win five Grammy Awards in a single night, following Lauryn Hill at the 41st Grammy Awards. That same year, she collaborated with Christina Aguilera for the latter's upcoming album Stripped on a song entitled Impossible, which Keys wrote, co-produced, and provided with background vocals. During the early 2000s, Keys also made small cameos in television series Charmed and American Dreams.

Keys followed up her debut with The Diary of Alicia Keys, which was released in December 2003. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 618,000 copies its first week of release, becoming the largest first-week sales for a female artist in 2003. It sold 4.4 million copies in the United States and was certified four times Platinum by the RIAA. It sold nine million copies worldwide, becoming the sixth biggest-selling album by a female artist and the second biggest-selling album by a female R&B artist. The singles You Don't Know My Name and If I Ain't Got You both reached the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the third single, Diary, entered the top ten. The fourth single, Karma, was less successful on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 20. If I Ain't Got You became the first single by a female artist to remain on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for over a year.

Keys won Best R&B Video for If I Ain't Got You at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards; she performed the song and Higher Ground with Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder. Later that year, Keys released her novel Tears for Water: Songbook of Poems and Lyrics, a collection of unreleased poems from her journals and lyrics. The title derived from one of her poems, ""Love and Chains"" from the line: ""I don't mind drinking my tears for water."" She said the title is the foundation of her writing because ""everything I have ever written has stemmed from my tears of joy, of pain, of sorrow, of depression, even of question"". The book sold over US$500,000 and Keys made The New York Times bestseller list in 2005. The following year, she won a second consecutive award for Best R&B Video at the MTV Video Music Awards for the video Karma. Keys performed If I Ain't Got You and then joined Jamie Foxx and Quincy Jones in a rendition of Georgia on My Mind, the Hoagy Carmichael song made famous by Ray Charles in 1960 at the 2005 Grammy Awards. That evening, she won four Grammy Awards: Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for If I Ain't Got You, Best R&B Song for You Don't Know My Name, Best R&B Album for The Diary of Alicia Keys, and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals"" for My Boo with Usher.

Keys performed and taped her installment of the MTV Unplugged series in July 2005 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. During this session, Keys added new arrangements to her original songs and performed a few choice covers. The session was released on CD and DVD in October 2005. Simply titled Unplugged, the album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart with 196,000 units sold in its first week of release. The album sold one million copies in the United States, where it was certified Platinum by the RIAA, and two million copies worldwide. The debut of Keys' Unplugged was the highest for an MTV Unplugged album since Nirvana's 1994 MTV Unplugged in New York and the first Unplugged by a female artist to debut at number one. The album's first single, Unbreakable, peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. It remained at number one on the Billboard Hot Adult R&B Airplay for 11 weeks.

Keys opened a recording studio in Long Island, New York, called The Oven Studios, which she co-owns with her production and songwriting partner Kerry ""Krucial"" Brothers. The studio was designed by renowned studio architect John Storyk of WSDG, designer of Jimi Hendrix' Electric Lady Studios. Keys and Brothers are the co-founders of KrucialKeys Enterprises, a production and songwriting team who assisted Keys in creating her albums as well as create music for other artists.

In 2006, Keys won three NAACP Image Awards, including Outstanding Female Artist and Outstanding Song for Unbreakable. She also received the Starlight Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In October 2006, she played the voice of Mommy Martian in the ""Mission to Mars"" episode of the children's television series The Backyardigans, in which she sang an original song, Almost Everything Is Boinga Here. That same year, Keys nearly suffered a mental breakdown. Her grandmother had died and her family was heavily dependent on her. She felt she needed to ""escape"" and went to Egypt for three weeks. She explained: ""That trip was definitely the most crucial thing I've ever done for myself in my life to date. It was a very difficult time that I was dealing with, and it just came to the point where I really needed to—basically, I just needed to run away, honestly. And I needed to get as far away as possible.""

Keys released her third studio album, As I Am, in November 2007; it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 742,000 copies in its first week. It gained Keys her largest first week sales of her career and became her fourth consecutive number one album, tying her with Britney Spears for the most consecutive number-one debuts on the Billboard 200 by a female artist. The week became the second largest sales week of 2007 and the largest sales week for a female solo artist since singer Norah Jones' album Feels like Home in 2004. The album has sold nearly four million copies in the United States and has been certified three times Platinum by the RIAA. It has sold nearly six million copies worldwide. Keys received five nominations for As I Am at the 2008 American Music Award and ultimately won two. The album's lead single, No One, peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, becoming Keys' third and fifth number-one single on each chart, respectively. The album's second single, Like You'll Never See Me Again, was released in late 2007 and peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The album's third single, Teenage Love Affair, peaked at number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. She released the fourth single, Superwoman, which peaked at number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 12 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.

No One earned Keys the awards for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song at the 2008 Grammy Awards. Keys opened the ceremony singing Frank Sinatra's 1950s song Learnin' the Blues as a ""duet"" with archival footage of Sinatra in video and No One with John Mayer later in the show. Keys also won Best Female R&B Artist during the show.  Keys, along with The White Stripes' guitarist and lead vocalist Jack White, recorded the theme song to Quantum of Solace, the first duet in Bond soundtrack history. In 2008, Keys was ranked in at number 80 the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists. She also received three nominations at the 2009 Grammy Awards and won Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for Superwoman.

In an interview with Blender magazine, Keys allegedly said ""'Gangsta rap' was a ploy to convince black people to kill each other, 'gangsta rap' didn't exist"" and went on to say that it was created by ""the government"". The magazine also claimed she said that Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. were ""essentially assassinated, their beefs stoked by the government and the media, to stop another great black leader from existing"". Keys later wrote a statement clarifying the issues and saying her words were misinterpreted. Later that year, Keys was criticized by anti-smoking campaigners after billboard posters for her forthcoming concerts in Indonesia featured a logo for the A Mild cigarette brand sponsored by tobacco firm Philip Morris. She apologized after discovering that the concert was sponsored by the firm and asked for ""corrective actions"". In response, the company withdrew its sponsorship.

Keys collaborated with record producer Swizz Beatz to write and produce Million Dollar Bill for Whitney Houston's seventh studio album, I Look to You. Keys had approached Clive Davis for permission to submit a song for the album. Keys also collaborated with recording artist Jay-Z on the song Empire State of Mind from his 2009 album, The Blueprint 3. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 and became her fourth number-one single on that chart.

The following month, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers honored Keys with the Golden Note Award, an award given to artists ""who have achieved extraordinary career milestones"". She collaborated with Spanish recording artist Alejandro Sanz for Looking for Paradise, which topped the Hot Latin Songs chart. Keys released her fourth studio album, The Element of Freedom, in December 2009. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 417,000 copies in its first week. As part of the promotional drive for the album, she performed at the Cayman Island Jazz Festival on December 5, the final night of the three day festival which will be broadcast on Black Entertainment Television (BET). The album's lead single, Doesn't Mean Anything, has peaked at number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100. Keys was ranked as the top R&B recording artist of the 2000–2009 decade by Billboard magazine and ranked at number five as artist of the decade, while her song, No One, was ranked at number six on the magazine's songs of the decade. In the United Kingdom, The Element of Freedom became Keys' first album to top the UK Albums Chart.

According to Songfacts, Keys said regarding the title of her fifth studio album, Girl On Fire. ""Before making this record, in some ways I felt like a lion locked in a cage. I felt like a girl misunderstood that no one really knew, I felt like it was time to stop making excuses for any part of my life that I wanted to change. Once I made that choice I became a Girl on Fire, the lion broke free!!"" The title track will be made available on iTunes and radio on September 4, 2012.

In May 2009, Swizz Beatz announced that he and Keys were romantically involved, and in May 2010, a representative for Keys and Swizz Beatz confirmed that they were engaged and expecting a child together. During the time of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the couple took part of a union and had the unborn child blessed in a Zulu ceremony, which took place in the Illovo suburb of South Africa. Keys and Swizz Beatz were married on the French island of Corsica on July 31, 2010. On October 14, 2010, Keys gave birth to a son, Egypt Daoud Ibarr Dean, in New York City.

M.I.A.,"There are five known artists under this name: 

(1) Mathangi “Maya” Arulpragasam, (born 18 July 1975 in Hounslow, London, U.K.) is a British artist of Sri Lankan descent. As a baby she moved with her family to their native Sri Lanka, where her father became increasingly politically active in militant activities. As the Civil War escalated the rest of the family was forced to flee as refugees, first to India and then the UK. “M.I.A.” [“Missing In Action”] references both her London neighborhood (Acton) and her politically tumultuous youth.

Her style contains elements of hip-hop, reggae, alternative, dance hall, electro and baile funk and is strongly inspired by her Sri Lankan background.

(2) American Punk/Hardcore band formed in Orange County, CA in 1981 by Chris Moon, drums; Mike Conley, bass; Nick Adams, guitar (all previously of Las Vegas, NV punk band The Swell); and Art Carasco, vocals. Their sound was generally hardcore and thrasher, though they produced more melodic and progressive sounds in their later albums. Allmusic called the band ""one of the 50 best So-Cal punk bands of the great early-'80s second wave explosion. In 1984 they signed a deal with the cult Alternative Tentacles label, after the label's founder, Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra, saw them play at a secret illegal punk nightclub in Las Vegas. Biafra was impressed by Mike Conley's distinctive voice, saying ""The minute you hear a song with him singing you know it's him."" They released the album Murder in a Foreign Place on Alternative Tentacles in 1984, followed in 1985 by Notes From the Underground on National Trust Records, and in 1987 by After the Fact on Flipside Records. The band split up in 1988. In 2001, Alternative Tentacles released Lost Boys, a 37-song retrospective of the band's work, including Last Rites, Murder in a Foreign Place, and several additional tracks. On February 28, 2008 vocalist Mike Conley was found dead in a Chicago hotel parking lot. Conley was taken to Gottlieb Memorial Hospital in Melrose Park, where he was pronounced dead at 6:25 a.m. On April 27, 2008, there was a secret warm-up show at Detroit Bar featuring Todd Sampson of Self Abuse and Samson's Army on vocals, Jello Biafra of Dead Kennedys on guest vocals, Chris Moon and Larry Pearson on drums, Nick Adams on guitar, and Bob Thomson on bass. The next day, the ""Beautiful Noise"" benefit show took place at the Anaheim House of Blues with Jigsaw, Naked Soul, Cadillac Tramps, Social Distortion and MIA with the same lineup as the previous night, but adding Kevin Seconds of 7 Seconds on guest vocals. The proceeds of ""Beautiful Noise"" went to Mike Conley's family.

(3) Formed in the mid 70s, Independent Musicians Associated (MIA) was a group of musicians, technicians and drawers gathered together by Lito and Liliana Vitale’s parents. They produced their own records and concerts in an independent way. Their music is a complex symphonic rock with definite Argentinean/latin folk influence with multiple chorals and vocals beautifully contrasting with the keyboards and a great guitar sound upon a strong rhythmic section. They were highly influenced by symphonic music, more noteworthy by Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Focus.

(4) Merriweathers is a member of Underground Resistance under the alias of The Unknown Soldier.

Joy Division,"Joy Division were a post-punk band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of Ian Curtis (vocals and occasional guitar), Bernard Sumner (guitar and keyboards), Peter Hook (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Stephen Morris (drums and percussion). The band dissolved in May 1980 after the suicide of its lead singer, Ian Curtis. Much of their popularity/reputation arguably resulted from frequent playings on air by iconic DJ John Peel, but it is easy now to overlook the impact that the first album, Unknown Pleasures, had on post-punk music at the time, as reference the number of prominent bands that cited this album as an influence. The remaining members reformed as New Order and they have gone on to achieve much critical and commercial success.

With their dark, cavernous sound and their use of synthesizers and electronics, Joy Division are considered the pioneering band of the post-punk movement of the late 1970s and the early 1980s.

Though they found only modest success during their career, and released only two studio albums, Joy Division have since been acclaimed as one of the most inventive, evocative and influential groups of their era; Thom Jurek writes ""They left just a small bit of music and an echo that still rings"".

1976
Inspired by a Sex Pistols gig at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall on July 20, 1976, Bernard Sumner (also credited as ""Bernard Dicken"" and ""Bernard Albrecht"") and Peter Hook formed a band with friend Terry Mason. Sumner bought a guitar, Hook purchased a bass, and Mason a drum kit. The band placed an advertisement in a Manchester record store and recruited Curtis as their singer. Curtis knew Sumner, Hook and Mason from previous gigs and was also in attendance at the Sex Pistols concert with his wife, Deborah. Richard Boon and Pete Shelley of Buzzcocks suggested the name ""Stiff Kittens"" for the band. Although ""Stiff Kittens"" appeared on some gig flyers, the band didn't like the name and never officially accepted it.

1977
Lacking confidence in his abilities as a drummer, Mason quit the group the day before their first gig to become their manager. He was replaced by Tony Tabac. Just before their first gig on May 29, 1977, supporting Buzzcocks and Penetration at the Electric Circus, the band renamed themselves Warsaw; though they had already appeared on the bill as the Stiff Kittens. Five weeks and half a dozen gigs later, Tabac was replaced by punk drummer Steve Brotherdale from another band called Panik. They recorded The Warsaw Demo on July 18, 1977, consisting of five crude punk songs.

After the demo, Brotherdale was fired. One member asked him to check on what he ""thought"" was a flat tyre. When he got out of the car, the other three drove off. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to join Panik but was rebuffed. Stephen Morris who responded to an ad in a music store window, was hired as Brotherdale's replacement. He was hired primarily because Curtis remembered him from his academic days as Morris attended the same school two years below Curtis. Unlike the previous drummers, Morris clicked well with the three. His metronome-like drumming owed more to krautrock than the aggressive bombast typical of many punk drummers.

In late 1977, in order to avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, Warsaw renamed themselves Joy Division. The name was in reference to groups of women used as sex slaves in Nazi German concentration camps depicted in Ka-Tzetnik 135633's 1955 novel The House of Dolls. Although the choice of name was more reflective of a desire to challenge taboos, this choice along with Sumner's adoption of the surname Albrecht garnered the band a lot of criticism for perceived insensitivity. They were even dogged by accusations of neo-Nazism, a charge they strenuously denied. The accusations resurfaced to a certain degree after Joy Division broke up and reformed as New Order, a name that could be interpreted as a reference to Hitler's speeches promising ""the new order of the Third Reich."" .

The band's music and style stabilized around this time. Sessions recorded in December 1977 sound considerably different from The Warsaw Demo.

1978
The group played their first gig as Joy Division on January 25, 1978. They played regularly in the north of England throughout early 1978, and then recorded enough material for a debut album. However, after the studio engineer added synthesizers to several tracks, the band scrapped it. The album would be released as a bootleg in 1982 and then officially 10 years later.

Rob Gretton became the band's manager in May 1978. Over the next 20 years, his addition would play an integral part in forming the Joy Division/New Order legacy.

Joy Division's debut on vinyl was on a compilation in the summer of 1978 called Short Circuit. Though listed as Joy Division, it was actually a track from the Warsaw days recorded live on October 2, 1977 The song, recorded live, was preceded by Sumner screaming ""You all forgot Rudolf Hess"". In June 1978 their December 1977 sessions were released as a 7"" EP under the title An Ideal for Living. In late 1978, An Ideal for Living was remastered and re-released as a 12"".

On September 20, 1978, they performed on the TV show Granada Reports; then in December 1978, they appeared on the compilation EP A Factory Sample, contributing two tracks recorded a few months earlier. This EP sold out within a couple of months and was the first release to document the haunting and atmospheric sound that Joy Division had been developing since that past summer.

Early 1979 saw Joy Division gain more publicity. Ian Curtis appeared on the front cover of the New Musical Express. Joy Division recorded a radio session in January (aired on BBC Radio 1 on February 14 by the respected DJ John Peel). On March 4, they supported The Cure at the Marquee Club, a major venue in London.

In April 1979, the band began recording their landmark debut album Unknown Pleasures at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, Greater Manchester. The record was far bleaker and darker than most of its contemporaries, featuring Hook's bass as the lead melodic instrument, drums soaked in icy reverb, Sumner's jagged guitar and Curtis's baritone vocal style. A large debt was owed to the genius of meticulous producer Martin Hannett. Whereas most punk rock bands had been extroverted and aggressive, Joy Division were more introverted and personal. Despite their insularity, however, their music could be very aggressive, chaotic and at times even violent.

The album cover, designed by Peter Saville based on a graph of 100 consecutive pulses from the pulsar CP 1919, is regarded as a classic of minimalist sleeve design. The image was found by Sumner in a book of Astronomy and represents ""the final flashes of a dying star."" Unknown Pleasures was released in June while Joy Division were recording five songs for Piccadilly Radio.

They performed on Granada TV again in July, made their first and last nationwide TV appearance in September on BBC2, supported The Buzzcocks in a 24-venue UK tour during October and November, and performed again on Peel's BBC radio show in December.

Despite the fact that Unknown Pleasures was selling well and receiving good reviews from the music press, all was not well. Curtis, who suffered from epilepsy, would often have onstage tonic-clonic seizures that resulted in unconsciousness and convulsions, or absence seizures that would cause brief trance-like pauses. Even after disposing of their light show, Curtis would still have these problems; and the band decided to rest over the Christmas holiday.

1980
In January 1980, Joy Division set out on a European tour. Several dates were cancelled due to Curtis's deteriorating health.

On February 28th, the band played a gig at the Warehouse in Preston. The gig was plagued with sound problems but was later released on Dynamic Records.

With Martin Hannett, again producing, the band began recording their second album Closer at the end of the European tour in March.

On April 8, the band played a gig at the Derby Hall in Bury. After jamming with support band Section 25, Joy Division's set began with Alan Hempstall of Crispy Ambulance and Simon Topping of A Certain Ratio filling in for Curtis who was initially too ill to perform. Curtis did manage to return, but only for a few songs. When the band resumed jamming without their singer, some members of the audience protested, turning the gig into a riot in which Hook, Gretton, and other crew members fought with angry onlookers.


Death of Curtis
Following a one-off gig in early May 1980, the band took a two weeks' rest before their first American tour was scheduled to start. At the time, Curtis's relationship with his wife, Deborah Curtis, was collapsing due to his infidelity with a Belgian woman, Annick Honoré, whom he had met on tour (no photograph of Honoré had ever been published until the 2006 book Torn Apart: The Life of Ian Curtis by Middles & Reade in which Annick gives her first public account of their relationship). Alone in his Macclesfield home, on May 18, 1980, Curtis reportedly watched Werner Herzog's Stroszek — about an artist who commits suicide — listened to Iggy Pop's debut solo album, The Idiot, and hanged himself. The following day, Curtis' body was discovered by his wife in their kitchen.

Aftermath
The band had long decided that if any one of them left or was unable to perform for any reason, they would end the band. In the summer of 1980, Love Will Tear Us Apart hit number 13 on the British singles chart, their biggest commercial success to date. In July 1980, Closer was finally released to overwhelmingly positive reviews; it also charted, peaking at number 6 on the British album chart. Sales of Unknown Pleasures were also robust.

At first glance Curtis' suicide appears to be exclusively the product of his own depression and ill health. Deborah Curtis' book Touching from a Distance gives the impression that Curtis always wanted to die young.

Despite Curtis' suicide, Joy Division essentially did not end in 1980, as the surviving members immediately toured and soon recorded new music. Eventually renaming themselves New Order and adding Morris' girlfriend Gillian Gilbert to cover keyboards and second guitar, the band was accordingly reborn. Alternating between guitar-drum-bass and electronic styles, the band's music reached and inspired a variety of listeners. New Order is often cited as one of the leading Synth Pop and dance music groups of their era, yet their use of traditional rock instruments such as guitars and live drums has reached a level of influence comparable with their landmark electronic works and they have become one of alternative rock's most beloved acts.

The band, and especially Ian Curtis, has been an inspiration for a number of musicians that include U2, The Smashing Pumpkins, Trent Reznor (who, as Nine Inch Nails, covered ""Dead Souls"" for the soundtrack of the movie The Crow), Robert Smith of The Cure and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante. The continuing importance of Joy Division was shown at the turn of the millennium when Peel asked his listeners to vote for the all-time Festive 50. At number one was the haunting Atmosphere, while Love Will Tear Us Apart sat at number three. Three more songs from the band sat on the list.

Much of the history of Joy Division was portrayed in the 2002 MGM/United Artists released film 24 Hour Party People which presented a somewhat fictionalised account of the rise and fall of the Factory Records, with whom both Joy Division and New Order were signed.

In 2007 the movie Control, directed by Anton Corbijn - depicting Curtis' life - was released. Curtis' bandmates Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Stephen Morris provided incidental music for the soundtrack via New Order. The movie title comes from the Joy Division song ""She's Lost Control"".

Also in 2007, the documentary film simply titled Joy Division was released. Directed by Grant Gee, this movie is told by people who were there to experience Joy Division first-hand. The movie outlines the history of the legendary group and their first steps toward gigs and pre-recordings, but this is also the tale of a city - Manchester - which revitalises itself though the growing music scene of the time. The memories to the past are coloured by the suicide of singer Ian Curtis.

In 2005 Joy Division were accepted along with New Order into the UK Music Hall of Fame. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Division"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
The National,"The National is a Brooklyn-based alternative rock band formed in 1999, by friends from Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. The band's lyrics are written and sung by Matt Berninger in a distinctive, deep baritone. The rest of the band is composed of two pairs of brothers: Aaron Dessner (guitar, bass, keyboards), Bryce Dessner (guitar), Scott Devendorf (bass, guitar) and Bryan Devendorf (drums). 

Their self-titled debut album""The National"" (Brassland 2001) was recorded and released before they had played even a single show. They cut the album with engineer Nick Lloyd and formed a label with writer Alec Bemis, so those recordings could be released. Kerrang! magazine gave it four Ks, calling it ""the stuff underground legends are made of.""

The National made a second album, ""Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers"" (Brassland/Talitres 2003). The staff was the same, though Peter Katis, who produced ""Turn on The Bright Lights"" and ""Antics"" by Interpol, helped produce and mix, and Australian composer Padma Newsome from Clogs collaborated on arrangements and strings.

Following the first session of several for Bernard Lenoir on France's Radio Inter, an in-between EP was released, Cherry Tree, containing what would become the blueprint for the sound on their next record and the session of Sad Song's standout Murder Me Rachael. After these accolades and being impressed by their live show, Roger Trust signed them to Beggars Banquet.

A show at their favorite bar became a van ride to neighboring cities, became a plane ride to Europe, became two summers overseas. Their ties to those good jobs slackened. And they continue on their own path, moving out even further out in Brooklyn to Ditmas Park, where there is space and familiar suburban streets and even Geese on Beverly Road. Their album, ""Alligator"", much of which was recorded at their homes in Ditmas Park, was engineered by Paul Mahajan, who has worked with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV on the Radio. Padma Newsome camped out for a month with the band, and Peter Katis added more production and mixed the record at his house in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

Berninger's potent baritone still intones about matters fraught and funny and sad; about record collections, missing persons and medium-sized American hearts. But the record's not simply gothic or miserablist -- more like the plays of Tennessee Williams, it's full of peculiar intimacies and awkward grace. Alligator's heroes are reckless and possessed seducers, but they are apologetic ones. In The National's imaginings, in songs alternately lush and spare, there is something twighlit and dreamy worked out in the basement of our brains.

""Abel,"" ""Secret Meeting,"" and ""Lit Up"" were released as singles.

On May 22, 2007, The National released their follow-up to Alligator, Boxer, on Beggars Banquet. Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had heard their first album and earliest demos, Matt proceeded to steal lyrics and melodies from them and give them the attention they deserved while keeping the intimacy that made them special. They even managed to convince new friend Sufjan Stevens to lay down some piano tracks for them, and recorded the album in a scant 6 months after coming off the long post-Alligator road.

""Mistaken for Strangers"", ""Fake Empire"" and ""Apartment Story"" have been released as singles. The band have just finished touring North America and are on a large European autumn/winter tour after playing high slots at several large festivals. In their Dec. 07/Jan. 08 issue, Paste magazine named Boxer best record of 2007.

The band's fifth album, High Violet, was released on May 10, 2010 by 4AD Records. ""Bloodbuzz Ohio"", ""Anyone's Ghost"" and ""Terrible Love"" were released as singles.

Tycho,"Scott Hansen (born 1976/1977), professionally known as Tycho, is an American ambient music artist and producer, who is known as ISO50 for his photographic and design works. Tycho is currently signed to, and has released under, Ghostly International, but has also released music on Merck Records and Gammaphone Records. His song, Dictaphone's Lament, was used as the track on a music video entitled ""Live Life to the Fullest"", which was made by and featured on the action cartoon block Toonami. Additionally, his song Cascade (originally made for an Adult Swim/Ghostly International compilation) was played during the final moments of the original 11-year run of Toonami in 2008.

Hansen began releasing music over 10 years ago with The Science of Patterns EP. His first full-length, Sunrise Projector, came out in 2004, and as the critical acclaim continued in 2006 with the release of Past Is Prologue.

It was around 2008 that URBmagazine noted Tycho as one of the Next 100 artists to watch, and Hansen continued to release singles and experiment with more live instrumentation. In 2011, his meticulous process saw the release of Dive, his debut full-length for Ghostly International. Tranquil, nostalgic and melodic, the record established him beyond the realm of IDM and ambient.

Now with Awake, Tycho's second Ghostly LP, the project returns as a true three-piece band comprised of Zac Brown (guitar, bass) and Rory O’Connor (live drums). Lengthy touring for Dive brought Tycho to its full potential, and in efforts to capture the energy on the road Hansen invited Brown and O’Connor in to the creative process. Both the sound and artwork of Awake capture Hansens stylistic shift, conjuring a more kintetic and percussive sensory experience. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tycho"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Galantis,"Featuring Christian Karlsson of Miike Snow and Linus Eklöw from Style of Eye, Galantis are a Swedish superduo who represent the place where EDM and pop meet. Karlsson (the man behind hits like Britney Spears' ""Toxic"") met Eklöw (the man behind hits like Icona Pop's ""I Love It"") at the Robotberget studio in Stockholm. Their mutual admiration society turned into a project once they began discussing a more poignant style of EDM that retained pop's passion. The duo set up shop on the Stockholm archipelago in the Baltic Sea, began recording, and released the ""Smile"" single on the Atlantic label in late 2013. ~ David Jeffries <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Galantis"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Aerosmith,"Aerosmith is a prominent American rock band. Three of its members, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton, first met in Sunapee, New Hampshire in the late 60s, but it wasn't until 1970, in Boston, Massachusetts, that the three decided to form a band together. Later, they met up with Joey Kramer (drums) and Brad Whitford (rhythm guitar). The band enjoyed major popularity throughout the 70s, making rock anthems such as ""Dream On"" and ""Sweet Emotion"", but they split from 1979-84 due to serious in-group arguments and substance abuse problems that contributed to their decline.

Producing a wide variety of tunes influenced both by the 60s hard rock legends as well as the bombastic rhythm and blues artists that the band loved, Joe Perry and Steven Tyler became known as the ""toxic twins"" due to their rambunctious live performances and nasty lifestyles. The Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia reportedly said Aerosmith featured ""the druggiest bunch of guys I've ever seen."" Classics from their early area with much airplay also include 1974's ""Same Old Song And Dance"" and 1976's ""Back In The Saddle"", with 1973's ""Dream On"" being a concert favorite.

Jimmy Crespo replaced Joe Perry for about five years as the band's fortunes failed. However, in 1984, chiefly due to the tireless efforts of Joe Perry's then manager, Tim Collins, to reform the band, Aerosmith was born again. Despite his own client Perry's insistence that it was unthinkable, Collins succeeded in helping the band resolve old differences and ultimately overcome their addictions. By 1989, the band had completely stopped their drug abuse. During this time, they enjoyed a resurgence in popularity that has endured since and has made them one of top-selling and most popular rock bands in the world today. Part of that renewal came in the form of a 1986 collaboration with hip-hop stars Run- D.M.C. on a new rap rock version of Walk This Way. This song served as an early step in bridging the gap between the hip-hop community and mainstream rock and roll fans, and its incredibly popular music video brought both musical groups much acclaim. 

Massive hits from the band's 80s comeback include 1989's ""Love In An Elevator"" and 1987's ""Rag Doll"" among others. Areosmith's greatest worldwide hit has been ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"", a single from the blockbuster movie 'Armageddon'. They have even infiltrated Disney Theme Parks in the U.S. and other countries with their own thrill ride 'Rock 'n' Rollercoaster featuring Aerosmith'. Continuing the ubiquitous marketing plan, they are also featured in their own version of the popular ""Guitar Hero"" video game.

In 2010, the band suffered a setback, and an on-again, off-again break-up following an on-stage accident in which Steven Tyler broke his collarbone, but by mid-year, European tourdates were announced and the band went on.

The Legendary Child Songfacts states that This was released as the first single from Aerosmith's fifteenth studio album, Music From Another Dimension!, which will be released on August 28, 2012 . The lead single was ""Legendary Child,"" an unfinished piece originally put together in 1991 during the initial sessions for the Get a Grip album. The song was debuted live by the band on the finale of the eleventh series of American Idol on May 23, 2012.

Stevie Wonder,"Stevie Wonder is the stage name of Stevland Hardaway Morris (b. Stevland Hardaway Judkins, 13 May 1950 in Saginaw, MI, USA - a.k.a. Little Stevie Wonder), a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and activist.  He débuted, as Little Stevie Wonder, with the single ""I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It the Blues"" (1961, Tamla Motown) and his latest album is ""A Time 2 Love"" (Oct 2005, Motown)

Stevland lost his eyesight shortly after birth. When he was four, his mother left his father, and moved with the children to Detroit.  She changed her name back to Lula Hardaway and later changed her son's surname to Morris, partly for family reasons. Stevland Morris has remained Stevie Wonder's legal name ever since.

Wonder signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of eleven, and continues to perform and record for Motown to this day. Altogether, he has released more than thirty U.S. Top 10 hits and received twenty-two Grammy Awards, the most ever awarded to a male solo artist. In 2008, Billboard magazine placed Wonder fifth in their list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists. He has recorded numerous critically and commercially successful albums, as well as hit singles. Since the mid-1960s, he has written and produced songs for some of his labelmates (such as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and The Spinners), as well as outside artists like Michael Jackson. A multi-instrumentalist, Wonder plays drums, guitar, synthesizers, congas, and most famously the piano, harmonica, and keyboards. 

Wonder forged his divergent styles into a trademark sound, putting his musical signature on a quartet of albums that would change music forever: 1972's Talking Book, 1973's Innervisions, 1974's Fullfillingness' First Finale, and 1976's Songs in the Key of Life. By the end of the decade, Wonder had won a record fifteen Grammys, as well as numerous other awards.

In the following decades he wrote, among other classics, his 1982 collaboration with Paul McCartney, ""Ebony and Ivory,"" which remained number one for seven weeks in a row. 1984's The Woman in Red soundtrack produced the enduring classic ""I Just Called to Say I Love You,"" yet another number-one hit that gained him an Academy Award.

In 1989 Wonder was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside The Rolling Stones. 

His contribution to worldwide social and political change is just as impressive. He championed the effort to make Martin Luther King's birthday a national holiday, as well as becoming a driving force behind 1985's USA for Africa campaign, and being visible in U.S. musicians' fight against apartheid in South Africa. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Marvin Gaye,"Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr. (2 April 1939 - 1 April 1984) was an American soul and rnb singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist, known as ""The Prince of Soul"", or ""The Prince of Motown."" Originally a member of the doo-wop group The Moonglows, he pursued a solo career after the group disbanded and released many successful solo hits including ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"", ""Let's Get It On"" and  ""What's Going On"". His best albums are still held in extremely high regard, and he is often cited as one of the finest singers of his era.

Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr. was born in 1939 to Marvin Gay, Sr. and Alberta Gay in Washington, D.C.. Gaye began his career in Motown in 1958, and soon became Motown's top solo male artist. He scored numerous hits during the 1960s, among them ""Ain't That Peculiar"", ""Stubborn Kind of Fellow"", and ""How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)"", as well as several hit duets with Tammi Terrell, including ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"""" and ""You're All I Need to Get By"", before moving on to his own form of musical self-expression.

Along with Stevie Wonder, Gaye is notable for fighting the hit-making—but creatively restrictive—Motown record-making process, in which performers, songwriters and record producers were generally kept in separate camps. Gaye forced Motown to release his 1971 album What's Going On, which is today hailed as one of the best albums of all time. Subsequent releases proved that Gaye, who had been a part-time songwriter for Motown artists during his early years with the label, could write and produce his own singles without having to rely on the Motown system. This achievement would pave the way for the successes of later self-sufficient singer-songwriter-producers in African American music, such as Luther Vandross and Babyface.

During the 1970s, Gaye would release several other notable albums, including Let's Get It On and I Want You, and released several successful singles such as ""Come Get to This"", ""Got to Give It Up"" and ""Sexual Healing"". By the time of his shooting death in 1984, at the hands of his clergyman father, Gaye had become one of the most influential artists of the soul music era. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Marvin+Gaye"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Fifth Harmony,"Fifth Harmony (commonly initialized as 5H) is five-member American girl group formed on the second season of The X Factor in 2012. The group are from Miami, Florida, United States, the members consists of Ally Brooke, Normani Hamilton, Dinah Jane Hansen, Camila Cabello, and Lauren Jauregui. They signed a joint deal with Syco Music, owned by Simon Cowell, and Epic Records, L.A. Reid's record label, after finishing in third place behind Tate Stevens and Carly Rose Sonenclar on the show.

Fifth Harmony won MTV's Artist To Watch award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2014, Fifth Harmony was labeled as the #1 most 'Influential' X Factor USA contestant of all-time by FoxWeekly. Their debut EP, ""Better Together"" was released in 2013 with a first week position of No. 6 on the Billboard 200. Their debut studio album, ""Reflection"" was released on January 30, 2015, going to #5 on the US Billboard 200. The album included the song Worth It (feat. Kid Ink) which became their biggest hit, peaking at #12.

Fifth Harmony is composed of five singers who all successfully auditioned as soloists on The X Factor, but failed to progress individually to the Judges' Houses stage of the competition. They were later formed as a group at the end of bootcamp by Simon Cowell, thus qualifying for the ""Groups"" category. Originally, the group's name was ""LYLAS"" (acronym for Love You Like a Sister), but another group called ""The Lylas"" (which consists of four of Bruno Mars' sisters) claimed that the show stole their name. Thereafter, LYLAS changed their name to ""1432"" (which stands for I Love You Too), which was announced on the first live show on October 31, 2012, during which 1432 performed ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" by Taylor Swift. Simon Cowell and L.A. Reid were critical of the new name, and Cowell suggested that the group be renamed again. During the first live results show on November 1, 2012, 1432 performed ""Skyscraper"" by Demi Lovato in a sing-off with Sister C. Cowell decided to send 1432 through to the Top 12 and he announced that they would be renamed by the viewers online.

New Order,"New Order are an alternative rock/electronic dance band which formed in 1980 in Salford, England, United Kingdom by the three remaining members of Joy Division. The band's classic lineup consists of Bernard Sumner (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Peter Hook (bass, electronic percussion), Gillian Gilbert (keyboards, guitar) and Stephen Morris (drums, keyboards). The group effectively disbanded in 1993 but reformed in 1998. Gilbert left in 2001 to look after her and Morris' children and was replaced by guitarist/keyboardist Phil Cunningham. Hook left acrimoniously in 2007 and declared the band to be defunct. Initially, Sumner, Cunningham and Morris denied the band had split up, but in 2009, following the release of the trio's Bad Lieutenant album, they admitted that that they could not continue on without Hook and officially disbanded. However, the band reformed in 2011 for a pair of charity dates without Hook, with Gilbert returning to the fold and Tom Chapman replacing Hook on bass. 

Pioneers of dance music in the 1980s and one of the first bands to effectively and popularly synthesize keyboard- and guitar-based music, New Order's members hailed from Salford and Macclesfield, England out of the ashes of Joy Division, are noted as being one of the first bands to bridge the gap between Post-Punk and Dancefloor. They were Factory Records' highest selling artist. They also funded Factory's famous Manchester club, The Haçienda. The band partnered with Quincy Jones's American label Qwest, recorded with legendary hip-hop producer Arthur Baker (on 1983's single ""Confusion"" and 1984's ""Thieves Like Us""), and they embraced Ibizan club culture on the album, Technique.

The band was formed in 1980 by the three surviving members, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris of Joy Division after the lead singer Ian Curtis committed suicide. Morris' girlfriend (and later wife) Gillian Gilbert joined in October 1980 on keyboards and occasional guitar shortly after contributing guitar to the second release of New Order's first single ""Ceremony"". Their early music followed in the same vein as Joy Division, most notably on debut album Movement. This is mostly seen now as a 'transitional' album where the new 4-piece band was trying to find a new identity.

They continued to develop their music and their identity with tracks such as ""Procession"" and ""Temptation"" until 1983 when, under the influence of early electro funk and Italo-Disco tracks (most notably Klein & MBO's Dirty Talk), they released ""Blue Monday"", arguably their most famous song and the biggest-selling 12"" single of all time. This came in such a detailed Peter Saville-designed sleeve (replicating a floppy disc) that it is claimed by some that the band's record company, Factory, lost money on every copy sold. 

The release of ""Blue Monday"" coincided with the album Power, Corruption & Lies which further developed their dance/rock crossover. Other albums followed in 1985 (Low-Life), 1986 (Brotherhood) and 1989 (Technique, influenced heavily by Ibiza's acid house scene). In 1990 the band scored their sole number 1 hit with a song written by Keith Allen and performed with the England football team, ""World in Motion"", the official England World Cup song.  One more album, Republic followed in May 1993, which was released by London Records after the collapse of Factory in November 1992.

The band effectively split in 1993 to pursue solo projects, but returned with a triumphant gig at the Reading Festival in 1998. After the recording of 2001's Get Ready album Gillian Gilbert left the band amicably for family reasons - her and Stephen's daughter Grace had been diagnosed with Transverse myelitis and she came to the decision that it would be easier for the band to replace her than her husband. They have since gone on to produce one more album with the help of Phil Cunningham of Marion when they released their last album, Waiting For The Sirens' Call.

Hook left acrimoniously in 2007 and according to him, the band has effectively broken up. However, Sumner, Cunningham and Morris repeatedly denied that the band was over, and that if Hook no longer wanted to be in the band, that was his choice. Hook has since threatened to take legal action if they attempt to continue as New Order. In 2009, Sumner, Morris and Cunningham announced that they did not plan on continuing on as New Order without Hook. However, in September 2011 it was announced that they will reform as New Order for two concerts in October (Brussels and Paris), without Hook but with Gillian Gilbert. Hook's replacement is Tom Chapman, who is also in Bad Lieutenant with Sumner, Morris and Cunningham. The charity gigs in Brussels and Paris were very successful and New Order decided to go on tour in 2012. They played various concerts all over the world and also some big festivals in the summer.

Collaborations and other projects:
Shortly after the split, Sumner and Cunningham formed Bad Lieutenant. The band's debut album Never Cry Another Tear, released in 2009, features Morris on drums on several tracks, although he is not an official member of the band and has committed to continue musical projects with Gillian Gilbert. The band's various solo projects understandably seemed to contain elements of the New Order 'sound', and gave some clues as to each member's contribution to the band.

Bernard Sumner worked with Johnny Marr (formerly of The Smiths) and Neil Tennant (of The Pet Shop Boys) in the 'supergroup', Electronic. Peter Hook formed the bands Revenge and, later, Monaco. These projects gained some commercial success. Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert recorded two albums of songs as The Other Two, and also did scoring work for film and television. 

Each of New Order's four original members have, at various times, acted as producers and/or guest musicians under the moniker of Be Music for a myriad of Factory labelmates and other artists, including: Section 25, A Certain Ratio, Happy Mondays, Paul Haig, The Stockholm Monsters, The Stone Roses, and Stanton Miranda. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/New+Order"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,
Bruce Springsteen,"Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949 in Freehold, New Jersey, United States) is an American songwriter, singer, and guitarist. With a recording career stretching back to 1966 that continues to this day, he's recorded multiple award-winning studio albums and toured constantly, inspiring generations of pop and rock musicians. He's often known as ""The Boss"". 

He has frequently played as Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band. Most widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments, he often sings songs centered around his native New Jersey. Initially inspired by the tuneful songwriting of British invasion music as well as the vocal swagger of Elvis Presley, his eloquence in expressing ordinary, everyday problems has earned him numerous awards, including twenty Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, along with a notoriously dedicated and devoted global fan base. He has sold over 70 million releases in the U.S. alone.

Springsteen's lyrics often concern men and women struggling to make ends meet. In this sense he was sometimes compared to Woody Guthrie and other popular folk artists. He has gradually become more and more identified with progressive politics, particularly working-class pride. Springsteen is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, on which his album The Rising reflects.

Springsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock and roll albums, often inspired by contemporary pop rock, and somber folk-oriented works. Much of his iconic status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band present intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, among which Springsteen intersperses long, whimsical tales or deeply emotional stories alongside numerous jokes and asides.

Springsteen has long had the nickname ""The Boss,"" a term which he was initially reported to dislike but now seems to have come to terms with, as he sometimes jokingly refers to himself as such on stage. The nickname originated when a young Springsteen, playing club gigs with a band in the 1960s, took on the task of collecting the band's nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates.

Early years

Springsteen was born in a hospital in Long Branch, New Jersey. He was raised in nearby Freehold. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, was a bus driver of Dutch and Irish ancestry. His mother, Adele Ann Zirilli, was a legal secretary of Italian ancestry. He has an older sister, Virginia, and a younger sister, Pamela. Pamela Springsteen had a brief film career, but left acting to pursue still photography full time.

Raised a Roman Catholic, Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima parochial school in Freehold Borough, where he was at odds with both the nuns and other students, even though much of his later music reflected a deep Catholic ethos and included many rock-influenced, traditional Irish-Catholic hymns.

In ninth grade he transferred to the public Freehold High School, but did not fit in there either. He completed high school but felt so uncomfortable that he skipped his own graduation ceremony. He briefly attended Ocean County College, but dropped out. It is rumored that the Dean of Students confronted Springsteen because his clothing made the other students ""uncomfortable.""

Springsteen had been inspired to take up music at the age of seven after seeing Elvis Presley on The Ed Sullivan Show. At 13, he bought his first guitar for $18; later, his mother took out a loan to buy the 16-year-old Springsteen a $60 Kent guitar, an event he later memorialized in his song ""The Wish"".

In 1965, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist of The Castiles, and later lead singer of the group. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township, New Jersey and played a variety of venues, including Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village. Marion Vinyard said that she believed Springsteen when, as a young man, he said he was going to make it big.

From 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed around New Jersey with guitarist Steve Van Zandt, organist Danny Federici and drummer Vini Lopez in a band called Child, later renamed Steel Mill. They went on to play the mid-Atlantic college circuit, and also briefly in California. During this time Springsteen also performed regularly at small clubs in Asbury Park and along the Jersey Shore, quickly gathering a cult following. Other acts followed over the next two years, as Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and songwriting style: Dr Zoom & the Sonic Boom (early-mid 1971), Sundance Blues Band (mid 1971), and The Bruce Springsteen Band (mid 1971-mid 1972). With the addition of pianist David Sancious, the core of what would later become the E Street Band was formed, with occasional temporary additions such as horns sections, ""The Zoomettes"" (a group of female backing vocalists for ""Dr Zoom"") and Southside Johnny Lyon on harmonica. Musical genres explored included blues, R&B, jazz, church music, early rock'n'roll, and soul. His profilic songwriting ability, with more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums, brought his skill to the attention of several people who were about to change his life: new managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, and legendary Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond, who, under Appel's pressure, auditioned Springsteen in May 1972.

Even after gaining international acclaim, Springsteen's New Jersey roots reverberated in his music, and he routinely praised ""the great state of New Jersey"" in his live shows. Drawing on his extensive local appeal, he routinely sold out consecutive nights in major New Jersey and Philadelphia venues and, much like the Grateful Dead, his song lists varied significantly from one night to the next. He also made many surprise appearances at The Stone Pony and other shore nightclubs over the years, becoming the foremost exponent of the Jersey Shore sound.

1972–1974
Springsteen signed a record deal with Columbia Records in 1972, with the help of John Hammond, who had signed Bob Dylan to the same record label a decade earlier. Springsteen brought many of his New Jersey-based colleagues into the studio with him, thus forming the E Street Band (although it would not be formally named as such for a couple more years). His debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., released in January 1973, established him as a critical favorite, though sales were slow. Because of his lyrics-heavy, folk rock-rooted music exemplified on tracks like ""Blinded by the Light"" and ""For You,"" as well as the Columbia and Hammond connections, critics initially compared Springsteen to Bob Dylan. ""He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven't heard since I was rocked by 'Like a Rolling Stone',"" wrote Crawdaddy magazine editor Peter Knobler in Springsteen's first interview/profile, in March, 1973. Crawdaddy ""discovered"" Springsteen in the rock press and was his earliest champion. Famed music critic Lester Bangs wrote in Creem, 1975, that when Springsteen's first album was released.....""many of us dismissed it: he wrote like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, sang like Van Morrison and Robbie Robertson, and led a band that sounded like Van Morrison's."" The track ""Spirit in the Night"" especially showed Morrison's influence, while with ""Lost in the Flood"" Springsteen presented the first of his many portraits of Vietnam veterans.

In September 1973 his second album, The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle was released, again to critical acclaim but no commercial success. Springsteen's songs became grander in form and scope, with the E Street Band providing a less folky, more R&B vibe and the lyrics often romanticizing teenage street life. ""4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)"" and ""Incident on 57th Street"" would become fan favorites, and the long, rousing ""Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)"" would rank among Springsteen's most beloved concert numbers.

In the May 22, 1974 issue of Boston's The Real Paper, music critic Jon Landau wrote after seeing a performance at the Harvard Square Theater, ""I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time."" Landau subsequently became Springsteen's manager and producer, helping to finish the epic new album, Born to Run. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a wall of sound production. But, fed by the release of an early mix of ""Born to Run"" to progressive rock radio, anticipation built toward the album's release.

1975–1981
On August 13, 1975, Springsteen and the E Street Band began a five-night, 10-show stand at New York's Bottom Line club; it attracted major media attention, was broadcast live on WNEW-FM, and convinced many skeptics that Springsteen was for real. (Decades later, Rolling Stone magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll.) With the release of Born to Run on August 25, 1975, Springsteen finally found success: while there were no real hit singles, ""Born to Run"", ""Thunder Road"", ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-out"" and ""Jungleland"" all received massive FM radio airplay and remain perennial favorites on many classic rock stations to this day. With its panoramic imagery, thundering production and desperate optimism, some fans consider this among the best rock and roll albums of all time and Springsteen's finest work. It established him as a sincere and dynamic rock and roll personality who spoke for and in the voice of a large part of the rock audience. To cap off the triumph, Springsteen appeared on the covers of both Time and Newsweek in the same week, on October 27 of that year. So great did the wave of publicity become that Springsteen eventually rebelled against it during his first venture overseas, tearing down promotional posters before a concert appearance in London.

A legal battle with former manager Mike Appel kept Springsteen out of the studio for over two years, during which time he kept The E Street Band together through extensive touring across the U.S. Despite the optimistic fervor with which he often performed, the new songs he was writing and often debuting on stage had taken a more somber tone than much of his previous work. Reaching settlement with Appel in 1977, Springsteen finally returned to the studio, and the subsequent sessions produced Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978). Musically, this album was a turning point of Springsteen's career. Gone were the rapid-fire lyrics, outsized characters and long, multi-part musical compositions of the first three albums; now the songs were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen's growing intellectual and political awareness. Some fans consider Darkness Springsteen's best and most consistent record; tracks such as ""Badlands"" and ""The Promised Land"" became concert staples for decades to come, while the track ""Prove It All Night"" received a significant amount of radio airplay (#33, Billboard Hot 100). Other fans would prefer the work of the adventurous early Springsteen. The cross-country 1978 tour to promote the album would become legendary for the intensity of its shows.

By the late 1970s, Springsteen had earned a reputation in the pop world as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. Manfred Mann's Earth Band had achieved a U.S. number one pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of Greetings' ""Blinded by the Light"" in early 1977. Patti Smith reached number 13 with her take on Springsteen's unreleased ""Because the Night"" (which Smith co-wrote) in 1978, while The Pointer Sisters hit number two in 1979 with Springsteen's also-unreleased ""Fire"".

In September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the Musicians United for Safe Energy anti-nuclear power collective at Madison Square Garden for two nights, playing an abbreviated setlist while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent No Nukes live album, as well as the following summer's No Nukes documentary film, represented the first official recordings and filmings of Springsteen's fabled live act, as well as Springsteen's first tentative dip into political involvement.

Springsteen continued to consolidate his thematic focus on working-class life with the double album The River in 1980, which finally yielded his first hit Top Ten single as a performer, ""Hungry Heart"", but also included an intentionally paradoxical range of material from good-time party rockers to emotionally intense ballads. The album sold well, and a long tour in 1980 and 1981 followed, featuring Springsteen's first extended playing of Europe and ending with a series of multi-night arena stands in major cities in the U.S.

1982–1989
Springsteen suddenly veered off the normal rock career course, following The River with the stark solo acoustic Nebraska in 1982. According to the Marsh biographies, Springsteen was in a depressed state when he wrote this material, and the result is a brutal depiction of American life. The title track on this album is about the murder spree of Charles Starkweather. The album actually started (according to Marsh) as a demo tape for new songs to be played with the E Street Band - but during the recording process, Springsteen and producer Landau realized they worked better as solo acoustic numbers; several attempts at re-recording the songs in a studio led them to realize that the original versions, recorded on a simple, low-tech four-track cassette deck in Springsteen's kitchen, were the best versions they were going to get.

While Nebraska did not sell especially well, it garnered widespread critical praise (including being named ""Album of the Year"" by Rolling Stone magazine's critics) and influenced later significant works by other major artists, including U2's album, The Joshua Tree. It helped inspire the musical genre known as lo-fi music, becoming a cult favorite among indie-rockers. Springsteen did not tour in conjunction with Nebraska's release.

Springsteen probably is best known for his album Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which sold 15 million copies in the U.S. alone and became one of the best-selling albums of all time with seven singles hitting the top 10, and the massively successful world tour that followed it. The title track was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans, some of whom were Springsteen's friends and bandmates. The song was widely misinterpreted as jingoistic, and in connection with the 1984 presidential campaign became the subject of considerable folklore. Springsteen also turned down several million dollars offered by Chrysler Corporation for using the song in a car commercial. (In later years, Springsteen performed the song accompanied only with acoustic guitar to make the song's original meaning more explicitly clear. An acoustic version also appeared on Tracks, a later album.) ""Dancing in the Dark"" was the biggest of seven hit singles from Born in the U.S.A., peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard music charts. The music video for the song featured a young Courteney Cox dancing on stage with Springsteen, an appearance which helped kickstart the actress's career; a number of the videos for the album were made by noted film directors Brian De Palma or John Sayles.

During the Born in the U.S.A. Tour he met actress Julianne Phillips. They were married in Lake Oswego, Oregon, on May 13, 1985 surrounded by intense media attention. Opposites in background, their marriage was not to be long-lived. Springsteen's 1987 album Tunnel of Love described some of his unhappinesses in the relationship and during the subsequent Tunnel of Love Express tour, Springsteen took up with backup singer Patti Scialfa, as reported by many tabloids. Subsequently, Phillips and Springsteen filed for divorce in 1988. The divorce was finalized in 1989.

The Born in the U.S.A. period represented the height of Springsteen's visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience demographic he would ever reach (this was further helped by releasing Arthur Baker dance mixes of three of the singles). Live/1975–85, a five-record box set (also released on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and also became a huge success, selling 13 million units in the U.S. and becoming the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the best selling live albums of all time. It summed up Springsteen's career to that point and displayed some of the elements that made his shows so powerful to his fans: the switching from mournful dirges to party rockers and back; the communal sense of purpose between artist and audience; the long, intense spoken passages before songs, including those describing Springsteen's difficult relationship with his father; and the instrumental prowess of the E Street Band, such as in the long coda to ""Racing in the Street"". Despite its popularity, some fans and critics felt the album's song selection could have been better. Springsteen concerts are the subjects of frequent bootleg recording and trading among fans.

After this commercial peak, Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative Tunnel of Love (1987), a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, which only selectively used the E Street Band. It presaged the breakup of his first marriage, to Julianne Phillips. Reflecting the challenges of love in Brilliant Disguise, Springsteen sang:

    I heard somebody call your name, from underneath our willow. I saw something tucked in shame, underneath your pillow. Well I've tried so hard baby, but I just can't see. What a woman like you is doing with me.

The subsequent Tunnel of Love Express tour shook up fans with changes to the stage layout, favorites dropped from the set list, and horn-based arrangements; during the European leg in 1988, Springsteen's relationship with E Street Band backup singer Patti Scialfa became public. Later in 1988, Springsteen headlined the truly worldwide Human Rights Now! tour for Amnesty International. In the fall of 1989, he dissolved the E Street Band, and he and Scialfa relocated to California.

1990s
Springsteen married Scialfa in 1991; they have three children Evan James (b. 1990), Jessica Rae (b.1991) and Sam Ryan (b.1994).

In 1992, after risking charges of ""going Hollywood"" by moving to Los Angeles (a radical move for someone so linked to the blue-collar life of the Jersey Shore) and working with session musicians, Springsteen released two albums at once. Human Touch and Lucky Town were even more introspective than any of his previous work. Also different about these albums was the confidence he displayed. As opposed to his first two albums, which dreamed of happiness, and his next four, which showed him growing to fear it, at points during the Lucky Town album, Springsteen actually claims happiness for himself.

Some E Street Band fans voiced (and continue to voice) a low opinion of these albums, (especially Human Touch), and did not follow the subsequent ""Other Band"" Tour. For other fans, however, who had only come to know Springsteen after the 1975 consolidation of the E Street Band, the ""Other Band"" Tour was an exciting opportunity to see Springsteen develop a working onstage relationship with a different group of musicians, and to see him explore the Asbury Park soul-and-gospel base in some of his classic material.

It was also during this tour that fans generally became aware of Springsteen using a teleprompter so as to not forget his lyrics, a practice that has continued ever since. An electric band appearance on the acoustic MTV Unplugged television program (that was later released as In Concert/MTV Plugged) was poorly received and further cemented fan dissatisfaction. Springsteen seemed to realize this a few years hence when he spoke humorously of his late father during his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech:

    I've gotta thank him because — what would I conceivably have written about without him? I mean, you can imagine that if everything had gone great between us, we would have had disaster. I would have written just happy songs – and I tried it in the early '90s and it didn't work; the public didn't like it.

A multiple Grammy Award winner, Springsteen also won an Academy Award in 1994 for his song ""Streets of Philadelphia"", which appeared in the soundtrack to the film Philadelphia. The song, along with the film, was applauded by many for its sympathetic portrayal of a gay man dying of AIDS. The music video for the song shows Springsteen's actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This was a technique developed on the ""Brilliant Disguise"" video.

In 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first Greatest Hits album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary Blood Brothers), he released his second (mostly) solo guitar album, The Ghost of Tom Joad. This was generally less well-received than the similar Nebraska, due to the minimal melody, twangy vocals, and didactic nature of most of the songs, although some praised it for giving voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour that followed successfully featured many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to be quiet during the performances.

Following the tour, Springsteen moved back to New Jersey with his family. In 1998, another precursor to the E Street Band's upcoming re-birth appeared in the form of a sprawling, four-disc box set of out-takes, Tracks. In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band officially came together again and went on the extensive Reunion Tour, lasting over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey to kick off the American leg of the tour.

2000s
Springsteen's Reunion Tour with the E Street Band ended with a triumphant ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City's Madison Square Garden in mid-2000 and controversy over a new song, ""American Skin (41 Shots)"", about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo. The final shows at Madison Square Garden were recorded and resulted in an HBO Concert, with corresponding DVD and album releases as Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band: Live in New York City.

In 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, The Rising, produced by Brendan O'Brien. The album, mostly a reflection on the September 11 attacks, was a critical and popular success. The title track gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record became Springsteen's best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on The Today Show, The Rising Tour commenced, barnstorming through a series of single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe to promote the album in 2002, then returning for large-scale, multiple-night stadium shows in 2003. While Springsteen had maintained a loyal hardcore fan base everywhere (and particularly in Europe), his general popularity had dipped over the years in some southern and midwestern regions of the U.S. But it was still strong in Europe and along the U.S. coasts, and he played an unprecedented 10 nights in Giants Stadium in New Jersey, a ticket-selling feat to which no other musical act has come close. During these shows Springsteen thanked those fans who were attending multiple shows and those who were coming from long distances or another country; the advent of robust Bruce-oriented online communities had made such practices more common. The Rising Tour came to a final conclusion with three nights in Shea Stadium, highlighted by renewed controversy over ""American Skin"" and a guest appearance by Bob Dylan.

During the 2000s, Springsteen became a visible advocate for the revitalization of Asbury Park, and he's played an annual series of winter holiday concerts there to benefit various local businesses, organizations and causes. These shows are explicitly intended for the faithful, featuring numbers such as the unreleased (until Tracks) E Street Shuffle outtake ""Thundercrack"", a rollicking group-participation song that would mystify casual Springsteen fans. He also frequently rehearses for tours in Asbury Park; some of his most devoted followers even go so far as to stand outside the building to hear what fragments they can of the upcoming shows. The song ""My City of Ruins"" was originally written about Asbury Park, in honor of the attempts to revitalize the city. Looking for an appropriate song for a post-Sept. 11 benefit concert honoring New York City, he selected ""My City of Ruins,"" which was immediately recognized as an emotional highlight of the concert, with its gospel themes and its heartfelt exhortations to ""Rise up!"" The song became associated with post-9/11 New York, and he chose it to close ""The Rising"" album and as an encore on the subsequent tour.

At the Grammy Awards of 2003, Springsteen performed The Clash's ""London Calling"" along with Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt in tribute to Joe Strummer; Springsteen and the Clash had once been considered multiple-album-dueling rivals at the time of the double The River and the triple Sandinista!.

In 2004, Springsteen announced that he and the E Street Band would participate in a politically motivated ""Vote for Change"" tour, in conjunction with John Mellencamp, John Fogerty, the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., Bright Eyes, Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne and other musicians. All concerts were to be held in swing states, to benefit MoveOn.org and to encourage people to vote against George W. Bush. A finale was held in Washington, D.C., bringing many of the artists together. Several days later, Springsteen held one more such concert in New Jersey, when polls showed that state surprisingly close. While in past years Springsteen had played benefits for causes in which he believed – against nuclear energy, for Vietnam veterans, Amnesty International and the Christic Institute – he had always refrained from explicitly endorsing candidates for political office (indeed he had rejected the efforts of Walter Mondale to attract an endorsement during the 1984 Reagan ""Born in the U.S.A."" flap). This new stance led to criticism and praise from the expected partisan sources. Springsteen's ""No Surrender"" became the main campaign theme song for John Kerry's unsuccessful presidential campaign; in the last days of the campaign, he performed acoustic versions of the song and some of his other old songs at Kerry rallies. Springsteen's stance coincided with a reduction in his fan base over the next two years, but how much was due to his politics versus his noncommercial music choices was unclear.

Devils & Dust was released on April 26, 2005, and was recorded without the E Street Band. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in the same vein as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad although with a little more instrumentation. Some of the material was written almost 10 years earlier during, or shortly after, the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, a couple of them being performed then but never released. The title track concerns an ordinary soldier's feelings and fears during the Iraq War. Starbucks rejected a co-branding deal for the album, due in part to some sexually explicit content but also because of Springsteen's anti-corporate politics. Nonetheless, the album entered the album charts at No. 1 in 10 countries (United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland). Springsteen began the solo Devils & Dust Tour at the same time as the album's release, playing both small and large venues. Attendance was disappointing in a few regions, and everywhere (other than in Europe) tickets were easier to get than in the past. Unlike his mid-1990s solo tour, he performed on piano, electric piano, pump organ, autoharp, ukulele, banjo, electric guitar and stomping board, as well as acoustic guitar and harmonica, adding variety to the solo sound. (Offstage synthesizer, guitar and percussion also are used for some songs.) Unearthly renditions of ""Reason to Believe"", ""The Promised Land"", and Suicide's ""Dream Baby Dream"" jolted audiences to attention, while rarities, frequent set list changes, and a willingness to keep trying even through audible piano mistakes kept most of his loyal audiences happy.

In November 2005, New Jersey Senators Frank Lautenberg and Jon Corzine sponsored a U.S. Senate resolution to honor Springsteen on the 30th anniversary of the release of his Born to Run album. In general, resolutions honoring native sons are passed with a simple voice vote. For unstated reasons, this resolution was killed in committee. Also in November 2005, Sirius Satellite Radio started a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week radio station on Channel 10 called ""E Street Radio."" This channel featured commercial-free Bruce Springsteen music, including rare tracks, interviews and daily concerts of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band recorded throughout their career.

In April 2006, Springsteen released another radical departure, We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, an American roots music project focused around a big folk sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism of Pete Seeger. It was recorded with a large ensemble of musicians, including only Patti Scialfa, Soozie Tyrell, and The Miami Horns from past efforts. In contrast to previous albums, this was recorded in only three one-day sessions, and frequently one can hear Springsteen calling out key changes live as the band explores its way through the tracks. The Bruce Springsteen with The Seeger Sessions Band Tour began the same month, featuring the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed the Seeger Sessions Band (and later shortened to the Sessions Band). Seeger Sessions material was heavily featured, as well as a handful of (usually drastically rearranged) Springsteen numbers. The tour proved very popular in Europe, selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent reviews, but newspapers reported that a number of U.S. shows suffered from sparse attendance. By the end of 2006, the Seeger Sessions tour toured Europe twice and toured America for only a short span. Bruce Springsteen with The Sessions Band: Live in Dublin, containing selections from three nights of November 2006 shows at the The Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, was released the following June.

Springsteen's most recent album, entitled Magic, was released on October 2, 2007. Recorded with the E Street Band, it featured ten new announced Springsteen songs plus ""Long Walk Home,"" performed once with the Sessions band, and a hidden track (the first included on a Springsteen studio release), ""Terry's Song,"" a tribute to Springsteen's long-time assistant Terry Magovern who died on July 30, 2007. The first single ""Radio Nowhere"" was made available for a free download on August 28. On October 7, Magic debuted at number 1 in Ireland and the UK. Greatest Hits reentered the Irish charts at number 57, and Live in Dublin almost cracked the top 20 in Norway again. On October 11, 2007 Media Traffic reported that Springsteen's Magic sold 563,000 copies around the world in its first week, making it the best-selling record in the world for that particular week. The next world chart saw Bruce remain at the top, selling another 270,000 copies of Magic and bringing the total for that album to 833,000 copies worldwide. Sirius Satellite Radio also restarted ""E Street Radio"" on Channel 10, on September 27, 2007 in anticipation of Magic. Radio conglomerate Clear Channel Communications reportedly decided to not play the new album, sending an edict to its classic rock stations to not play any songs from the new album, while continuing to play older Springsteen material.

An accompanying tour with the E Street Band began at the Hartford Civic Center with the album's release and was routed to North America and Europe. Springsteen and the band performed live on NBC's Today Show in advance of the opener. Springsteen was the musical guest on November 9, 2007 at former-New York Yankees manager Joe Torre's ""Safe At Home"" Foundation's 5th annual gala. Yankees' outfielder Bernie Williams joined Springsteen on stage and contibuted two guitar solos to an impromptu rendition of the Springsteen hit, ""Glory Days"".

Magic was followed up by a traditionally strong tour throughout 2008, during which original band-member and friend Danny Federici passed away. Federici had already been temporarily replaced by Charlie Giordano, with whom Springsteen played the year before during the Seeger Sessions. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band rounded the 100-show tour at Harley-Davidson’s 105th anniversary celebration.

On January 27, 2009 Springsteen’s twenty-fourth album “Working on a Dream” was released. According to the official press release, Working on a Dream was recorded with the E Street Band and features twelve new Springsteen compositions plus two bonus tracks. It is the fourth collaboration between Springsteen and Brendan O’Brien, who produced and mixed the album. A new tour for 2009 is expected to be announced soon. Springsteen and the E Street Band will play The Super Bowl halftime show on February 1, 2009.

Springsteen's 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball, was released on March 6, 2012. Three songs previously only available as live versions—""Wrecking Ball"", ""Land of Hope and Dreams"", and ""American Land""—appear on the album. The anthemic up-tempo rocker, ""We Take Care Of Our Own""  is the album's lead single. It finds The Boss singing of patriotism and brotherhood and decrying the broken promises of the government. ""Wherever this flag's flown, we take care of our own,"" he croons. The song was released on January 19, 2012.

Springsteen released his eighteenth studio album, High Hopes, on January 14, 2014. The first single and music video was a newly recorded version of the song ""High Hopes"", which Springsteen had previously recorded in 1995. The album was the first by Springsteen in which all songs are either cover songs, newly recorded outtakes from previous records, or newly recorded versions of songs previously released. The 2014 E Street Band touring lineup, along with deceased E Street Band members Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, appears on the album along with guitarist Tom Morello.

Film connections

Springsteen's music has long been intertwined with film. It made its first appearance in the 1983 John Sayles' film Baby, It's You, which featured several songs from Born to Run. The relationship Springsteen established with Sayles would re-surface in later years, with Sayles directing videos for songs from Born in the U.S.A. and Tunnel of Love. The song ""(Just Around the Corner to the) Light of Day"" was written for the early Michael J. Fox/Joan Jett vehicle Light of Day. His work has been used in films (winning him an Oscar for his song ""Streets of Philadelphia""). Additionally his 1995 song ""Secret Garden"" appeared on the soundtrack for the Tom Cruise film Jerry Maguire.

In turn, films have been inspired by his music, including The Indian Runner, written and directed by Sean Penn, which Penn has specifically noted as being inspired by Springsteen's song ""Highway Patrolman"". He was nominated for a second Oscar for ""Dead Man Walkin'"", from the movie Dead Man Walking. In addition, ""Lift Me Up"" ran over the credits for the John Sayles film Limbo.

Bruce also made a cameo appearance in the John Cusack film High Fidelity. In the film, Cusack's character, Rob, imagines Springsteen giving him advice on his fractured love life.

Jimi Hendrix,"James Marshall ""Jimi"" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; 27th November at Seattle's King County Hospital, 1942 - 18th September 1970) was a U.S. guitarist, singer, and songwriter.

Hendrix was not very popular in the U.S.A. at the outset of his musical career, only later gaining recognition after taking a trip to England in 1966 with The Animals' Chas Chandler, where he subsequently formed The Jimi Hendrix Experience with bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell. While The Experience quickly became popular in England, they remained relatively unrecognised outside the country. It was not until their 1967 performance at the Monterey International Pop Festival in the States that The Experience became, quite literally overnight, one of the most popular bands of the era.

Hendrix was mostly self-taught on the guitar. He was ambidextrous but chose to play the guitar upside-down and re-strung for playing left-handed, which suggests that he was more comfortable left-handed. As a guitarist, he built upon the innovations of blues stylists such as B.B. King, Albert King, Buddy Guy, T-Bone Walker, and Muddy Waters, as well as those of rhythm and blues and soul music guitarists such as Curtis Mayfield. Hendrix's music was also influenced by jazz; he often cited Rahsaan Roland Kirk as his favourite musician. In addition, Hendrix extended the tradition of rock guitar; although previous guitarists, such as The Kinks' Dave Davies, Jeff Beck, and The Who's Pete Townshend, had employed techniques such as feedback, distortion and other effects as sonic tools, Hendrix was able to exploit them to a previously undreamed-of extent, and made them an integral part of his own private, unique genre, which he called ""Red"".

Jimi's father Al Hendrix is credited as the one who gave Jimi his first real guitar, and (less positively) for claiming posthumous copyright ownership to suppress the publication of, for example, a live collaboration album between Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Buddy Miles, and  Johnny Winter. Earlier, the two would have jam sessions with Al on either bass or saxophone. As a record producer, Hendrix was an innovator in using the recording studio as an extension of his musical ideas. Hendrix was notably one of the first to experiment with stereo effects during the recording process. Hendrix was also an accomplished songwriter whose compositions have been performed by countless artists. At Woodstock, Larry Lee was a member of Hendrix' Band of Gypsys, and also played a Gibson Les Paul Studio model and sung with Hendrix as well. Many people thought Jimi was playing guitar alone, but the late, great Larry Lee assisted him in the Woodstock guitar performances.

The Hendrix sound combined high volume and high power, feedback manipulation, and a range of cutting-edge guitar effects, especially the UniVibe-Octavia combination, which can be heard to full effect on the Band of Gypsys' live version of ""Machine Gun"". He was also known for his trick playing, which included playing with only his right (fretting) hand, using his teeth or playing behind his back, although he soon grew tired of audience demands to perform these tricks.

While he may have dominated loud electric guitar, there was another side to Hendrix's music. On songs such as ""Little Wing"", ""Angel"", ""May this be Love"" and ""Castles Made of Sand"", he showcased his more gentle side with more tender guitar playing and lyrics.

Jimi Hendrix died in London, England from an overdose of sleeping tablets on the 18th September 1970. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
The Who,"The Who are an English Rock Band formed in Shepherd's Bush, West London, United Kingdom, in 1964. They grew to be considered one of the greatest, most influential, and awarded recording groups in the world. They are also famed for their prowess as a Live Band--being described as ""possibly the greatest live band ever""--due to their energetic, tight, loud performances and smashing of instruments. The primary lineup was: Pete Townshend (Lead Guitar, Vocals), Roger Daltrey (Lead Vocals, Harmonica, Percussion), John Entwistle (Bass, Vocals, French Horn) and Keith Moon (Drums, Occasional Vocals).

The Who rose to fame in the United Kingdom with a pioneering instrument destruction stage show, as well as a series of top ten Hit Singles (including the celebrated ""My Generation"") and Top Five Albums, beginning in 1965 with their first Single Release ""I Can't Explain"". They First Hit the Top Ten in the USA in 1967 with ""I Can See for Miles"". The 1969 release of Tommy was the first in a series of Top Five Albums for the group in the USA, followed by Live at Leeds (1970), Who's Next (1971), Quadrophenia (1973), and Who Are You (1978). Live at Leeds is commonly cited as one of the albums that brought Hard Rock into the mainstream during the early 1970s.

A mere three weeks after the release of Who Are You, Keith Moon passed away from an overdose on 7 September 1978. Kenney Jones of Small Faces/Faces took over on drums after Moon's death. The band would release two more studio albums: the top five Face Dances (1981) and the top ten It's Hard (1982), before officially disbanding in 1983. They reformed on several occasions, performing at Live Aid in 1985, and for their 25th anniversary tour (featuring most of Tommy) in 1989, as well as the Quadrophenia revival tour of 1996 and 1997.

In 2000, the three surviving original members began to discuss the possibility of recording an album of new material. These plans were delayed following the death of John Entwistle in 2002 from a cocaine-induced heart attack. However, subsequent to this, Pino Palladino became their touring bass player. Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey continue to perform and record as The Who; their latest studio album, Endless Wire (2006), reached the top ten in the USA and UK.

On May 6th, 2015, the band announced that they would be Glastonbury Festival's final headliner, closing the event on Sunday, June 28th 2015. Roger Daltrey said they would close the event ""with a bang"".  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Who"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lorde,"Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor (born 7 November 1996), known by her stage name ""Lorde"" (pronounced (/ˈlɔrd/) (IPA) or ""lord"" in standard English), is a New Zealand singer-songwriter and multiple Grammy Awards winner. She released her first EP, The Love Club EP, in March 2013 and her first single, ""Royals"", in June 2013. Her début album, Pure Heroine, was released on September 27, 2013.

She was born in Auckland, New Zealand. Her father, an Irish-New Zealander, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Sonja Yelich, a Croatian-New Zealander, is a prize-winning poet. She was raised in Devonport, a suburb of Auckland.

At the age of 12, she was spotted by A&R scout Scott Maclachlan when he saw her singing in a video of a talent show at her school, Belmont Intermediate. Later, when Yelich-O'Connor was 13, Maclachlan signed her to Universal Music and, at the age of 14, she began working with their songwriters in 2012.

Officially released digitally in March 2013 and on CD in May 2013, The Love Club EP features five songs, including the number one hit ""Royals"". On May 27 2013, ""Royals"" was covered on national television on the New Zealand version of The X Factor by all-girl group Gap 5, mentored by Melanie Blatt of the All Saints. ""Royals"" débuted as a single at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 on 15 March 2013 and remained in the top position for three weeks. In the U.S. it peaked at number 1 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on both the Alternative charts (making Lorde the first female artist since Tracy Bonham to reach the top) and number 1 on the Rock charts, making her the first female artist to top the charts as a lead singer.

On 8 May 2013,  The Love Club EP débuted in the number 2 position on the album chart. In August 2013, Lorde became the first woman to top the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States since Tracy Bonham in 1996. Following the release of ""Royals"" in the United States in June 2013, 85,000 copies were sold during a single week in July. In a subsequent interview, Lorde stated, ""I had a sneaking suspicion that it might do all right"". In November 2013, her song ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" was included on the soundtrack of ""the movie ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" along with tracks from Coldplay, Sia, The Weeknd, Christina Aguilera, Of Monsters and Men, and Imagine Dragons among others.

The ""Tennis Court"" single was released in New Zealand on 8 June 2013. The ""Tennis Court EP"" was released digitally in the UK on 7 June (due to the timezone difference) and physically on 22 June. It was played during the BBC Sport coverage of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles final. On 14 June 2013, Yelich-O'Connor's second single ""Tennis Court"" débuted at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 singles chart. In the same week, she also became the first New Zealand artist to simultaneously have four songs in the top 20 tracks of the New Zealand Top 40. Previously, Titanium held this record with three songs.

 2014 - Major Awards continue 
Lorde's success continued in 2014, picking up major awards at:

Marilyn Manson,"Marilyn Manson is an American rock band from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States formed in 1989 by frontman Marilyn Manson and Daisy Berkowitz. The group was originally named Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids, with their theatrical performances gathering a local cult following in the early 1990s, until the band shortened the name in 1992. The band's lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the current members of Marilyn Manson are the eponymous lead singer (the only remaining original member), bassist Twiggy Ramirez, guitarist Tyler Bates, live guitarist Paul Wiley, drummer Gil Sharone, and live percussionist / keyboardist Daniel Fox.

Until 1996, the name of each member was originally created by combining the first name of an iconic female sex symbol and the last name of an iconic serial killer (e.g. Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson). The members of the band dress in outlandish makeup and costumes, and have engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. In the past, their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs. Their performances have frequently been called offensive and obscene, and, on several occasions, protests and petitions have led to the group being banned from performing.

As this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band's mainstream popularity. Despite this, in June 2003, veteran rock journalist Jon Wiederhorn of MTV.com referred to Marilyn Manson as ""the only true artist today,"" and the frontman and band continues to have a strong cult following in 2016. Marilyn Manson has garnered much success: four of the band's releases have achieved multi-platinum and three albums have gold, and the band has seen seven of its releases debut in the top ten, including two #1 albums. Marilyn Manson has sold over 50 million records.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

---HISTORY---

The Spooky Kids: 1989-1993
In 1989, Brian Warner was a college student working toward a journalism degree, and gaining experience in the field by writing music articles for a South Florida lifestyle magazine, 25th Parallel. It was in this capacity that he was able to meet several of the musicians to whom his own band would later be compared, including My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.

He met Scott Putesky shortly afterward and, after showing him some lyrics and poems he had written, proposed that they form a band together. Warner, guitarist Putesky, and bassist Brian Tutunick recorded their first demo tape as Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids in late 1989, taking on the stage names of Marilyn Manson, Daisy Berkowitz and Olivia Newton Bundy, respectively. They were soon joined by keyboardist Perry Pandrea, also known as Zsa Zsa Speck, who shortly left the band after the fourth show. Stephen Bier, who called himself Madonna Wayne Gacy, was his replacement; Bundy was replaced by Gidget Gein in 1990, born Brad Stewart. In 1991, drummer Fred Streithorst joined the band, with the stage name Sara Lee Lucas.

The stage names used by each member were representative of a concept the band considered central: the dichotomy of good and evil, and the existence of both, together, in every whole. ""Marilyn Monroe had a dark side,"" explained Manson in his autobiography, ""just as Charles Manson has a good, intelligent side."" Images of both Monroe and Manson, as well as of others equally famous and notorious, were common in the band's early promotional materials.

The Spooky Kids' popularity in the area grew quickly, largely because of radio DJ Scott David of WYNX-FM, an early fan who eagerly played songs from the band's demo tapes on the air; and because of the band's highly visual concerts, which drew from performance art and used many shock techniques. It was not uncommon to see onstage naked women nailed to a cross, a child in a cage, or bloody animal body parts; Manson, Berkowitz, and Gein variously performed in women's clothing or bizarre costumes; and, for lack of a professional pyro-technician, they would occasionally set their own stage props on fire.

The band would dramatically contrast these grotesque theatrics with elements drawn from the culture of the members' youth in the 1970s and 1980s: characters from that era's children's television made regular, often somewhat altered, appearances on Marilyn Manson flyers and newsletters, and were frequently sampled in the music. They continued to perform and release cassettes—shortening their name to Marilyn Manson in 1992—until the summer of 1993, when the band drew the attention of Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who at the time had just founded his own record label, Nothing Records.

Portrait of an American Family: 1993-1995
Reznor offered Marilyn Manson a contract with his new label and the opportunity to support Nine Inch Nails on their upcoming headlining tour. The band accepted both offers, and recording sessions for its national debut, Portrait of an American Family, began in July 1993. Working with producer Roli Mosimann at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, the band recorded a selection of new songs along with material from their Spooky Kids repertoire and, by the end of Autumn 1993, had completed the first version of their debut, titled The Manson Family Album.

However, it was not well received. The abrasive sonic ""rawness"" that Mosimann's production had brought to such groups as Swans had failed to materialize on The Manson Family Album; Reznor and all the band's members found it flat and lifeless, and poorly representative of Marilyn Manson's dynamic performances. ""I thought, 'This really sucks', Manson explained, ""so I played it for Trent, and he thought it sucked."" At the same time, the band was having difficulties with Gidget Gein, who had begun to lose control of his addiction to heroin. 

While reworking the album the band played two shows in South Florida under the name Mrs. Scabtree. Not much is known about the complete lineup, except that Manson performed on the drums, Gacy on keyboard, Berkowitz on guitar, and Jeordie White of Miami thrash metal band Amboog-a-Lard and Jessicka of Jack Off Jill sharing vocal duties. Four other local musicians, bassists Mark Dubin of Sister Venus and Patrick Joyce from The Itch, guitarist Miles Hie, and violinist Mary Karlzen, were also involved.

In October 1993, Reznor agreed to rework the production on Marilyn Manson's album, taking them and their tapes to The Record Plant in Los Angeles. Gein, who had been hospitalized after an overdose, was not invited. After seven weeks of mixing, remixing, and rerecording, the album — now titled Portrait of an American Family — was ready to be presented to Interscope Records. Even as the first single Get Your Gunn was beginning to receive radio airplay, Gein received a letter declaring his services ""no longer needed"" by the band after he overdosed on heroin for the fourth time; he was replaced by White, of Amboog-a-Lard, who undertook the alias Twiggy Ramirez.

In December 1993, Ramirez first performed as the band's new bass player on a week's worth of headline dates through Florida with Jack Off Jill opening. While playing Club 5 in Jacksonville, Manson was accused by the town's Christian Coalition of violating the town's adult entertainment codes. Jack Off Jill singer Jessicka was accused of solicitation and offering to engage in lewdness. Both singers were arrested and charged with misdemeanors.

Portrait of an American Family was released on July 19, 1994 in the US through Nothing/Interscope. On the first date of a fourteen-week national tour opening for Nine Inch Nails, Ramirez made his national touring debut. It was during this tour that Manson had the occasion to meet with Church of Satan founder Dr. Anton LaVey. After a cordial meeting, LaVey honored Manson with the title of ""Reverend"" — meaning, in the Church of Satan, a person who is revered by the church, and not necessarily one who dedicates his life to preaching the religion to others, as with a priest or minister. Manson would use this title in album liner notes, citing himself as ""Reverend Marilyn Manson.""

On February 6, 1995, the band released the Lunchbox single, which featured a cover of Gary Numan's Down In the Park. In March 1995, the band began its first national headlining tour, a two-month outing with Monster Voodoo Machine as support; this would be drummer Sara Lee Lucas' last tour with the band. Tension between Lucas and Manson had apparently grown as the tour wore on and, on the next-to-last night of the tour, Manson secretly decided to end the show with a flourish: during a performance of Lunchbox, he doused Lucas' drum kit in lighter fluid and set it ablaze – with Lucas still attempting to play on behind it. (Manson apparently forgot that the band had one more date to play.) Lucas quit the band after the final gig the next night.

Less than two weeks later his replacement, Kenneth Wilson, better known by his stage name Ginger Fish, joined the group. Marilyn Manson was touring again, this time on a bill with Danzig and Korn.

That tour ended in summer 1995, after which the band relocated to the new home of Nothing Studios in New Orleans, Louisiana to begin work on the third single from Portrait of an American Family, Dope Hat. Accompanied by a music video which featured Manson in the role of Willy Wonka in a shock-horror version of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, the proposed single for Dope Hat eventually developed into an hour-long EP called Smells Like Children.

The album's fifteen tracks of covers, remixes, and bizarre sonic experiments also included the band's version of the Eurythmics' Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This), which would prove to be Marilyn Manson's first legitimate hit: the video was placed in heavy rotation on MTV (in stark contrast with the ""Dope Hat"" video, which MTV had banished to late-night airplay only a few months before) and the mainstream music press was suddenly clamoring to cover the group. It was also around this time that the group began to experiment with goth makeup, and more bizarre outfits.

A seven-month headlining tour followed, from June through February, during which the band began to debut new material including Irresponsible Hate Anthem, Minute of Decay, Tourniquet, and Smells Like Children (an early incarnation of Kinderfeld). Rumors of a new album circulated widely during this time, and were confirmed when the band returned to Nothing's New Orleans studio in early 1996 to perform what Manson termed ""a musical ritual designed to bring about the Apocalypse.""

Antichrist Superstar: 1996-1997
Marilyn Manson's second full-length studio album, Antichrist Superstar, was released on October 8, 1996. The rock opera concept album was recorded at Nothing Studios with Trent Reznor himself acting as executive producer; the process of making the album was reportedly a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments allegedly involving sleep deprivation and near-constant drug use in an effort to create an environment suited to the album's moody and occasionally violent content. During this time, antagonism between band members was high, which caused the departure of guitarist and Spooky Kids founding member Daisy Berkowitz.

With Berkowitz out of the band, Twiggy Ramirez performed lead guitar for much of the recording of Antichrist Superstar, and the group placed an ad seeking a new guitarist for its upcoming tour; Timothy Linton, auditioned for and was given the position. Breaking with the six-year tradition of icon / killer naming structures, the newest member was dubbed Zim Zum – a name derived from Kabbalah, one of the major sources of inspiration for the album.

The album's first single, The Beautiful People, made a fairly major impact on the alternative rock charts, and created enough anticipation for Antichrist Superstar that the album debuted at #3 on the album charts. The band's frontman was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine who also awarded the band their Best New Artist accolade for 1996. ""I've always felt in my heart that we were going to get there,"" remarked Manson. ""I don't think there's any reason why someone with as much to say as me should be limited to saying it to a few people. I should be on the same scale as the Spice Girls or Michael Jackson.""

The year-and-a-half long ""Dead to the World Tour"" in support of the album followed; it was the band's longest and widest-ranging tour yet, and included Marilyn Manson's live debut in Alaska, Hawaii, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, South America, Asia and Australia as their fame spread to all corners of the world. In the United States, however, the band was receiving more attention than ever before, and not all of it was positive.

As the tour was getting underway, the band found itself the target of congressional hearings, led by Senator Joseph Lieberman, to determine the effects, if any, of violent lyrics on young listeners. Lieberman would later go on to refer to Marilyn Manson as ""perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company"". In addition, nearly every performance on the tour was picketed by religious organizations, pleading with fans to not see the musician who once said ""I think every time people listen to this new album maybe God will be destroyed in their brainwashed minds.""

On November 10, 1997, the band released a remix/live EP called Remix & Repent, featuring new versions of Antichrist Superstar's four singles, The Beautiful People, Tourniquet, Antichrist Superstar, and Man that You Fear, alongside songs recorded live on the U.S. leg of the Dead to the World Tour. Two unreleased songs from the Antichrist Superstar recording sessions were contributed to film soundtracks: Apple of Sodom to David Lynch's Lost Highway, and The Suck for Your Solution to the Howard Stern's Private Parts: The Album.

As the year ended, Manson made the announcement of the upcoming publication of his first book, the autobiographical The Long Hard Road Out of Hell; the book was released in February 1998, along with another live document of the world tour, a home video entitled Dead to the World. It also came to light around this time that Antichrist Superstar would be the first installment in a concept album trilogy and that the release of the follow-up was, according to the band, also imminent, accompanied by early rumors of the involvement of Billy Corgan and The Dust Brothers with the as-yet-untitled album.

Mechanical Animals: 1998-1999
On September 15, 1998, Marilyn Manson released the second part of his triptych, Mechanical Animals, an album strongly influenced by David Bowie and his 1974 album Diamond Dogs. Interscope's promotion of the album was massive, including an enormous billboard of singer Manson as an androgynous extraterrestrial over Times Square, and repeated appearances on MTV and other networks to promote the album and the single The Dope Show; propelled by the success of Antichrist Superstar and by this press push, the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart.

The band had recast itself in a new image for this album; Marilyn Manson were now a glam rock outfit, setting aside the bleak darkness of the previous record for a more concealed morbidity and borrowing its visual presentation largely from Bowie, and from Roxy Music and its contemporaries. By this time, the band had permanently relocated to Los Angeles, and Zim Zum had been replaced by glam-influenced guitarist John Lowery, who joined the band as John 5.

After a brief promotional tour, the band set out on the ""Beautiful Monsters Tour"" with Hole and Monster Magnet as support. The tour, however, would be a problematic one: on March 1, 1999, the three bands played the first show in Spokane, Washington; by March 14, Hole had left the tour and Manson had broken his ankle, forcing postponements of some shows. The tour was then renamed the ""Rock is Dead Tour"" and both Jack Off Jill and Nashville Pussy were asked to take select remaining opening slots on tour.

Less than three weeks after the tour resumed, two students (Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold) at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado killed thirteen people, and then took their own lives; early media reports declared them fans of ""violent"" music and video games. Substantial attention was directed at the frontman. On April 28, out of respect for the victims, the band canceled the remaining dates of the tour, and would not reappear in Denver until the 2001 Ozzfest.

Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death): 2000-2001
The latter half of 1999 and much of 2000 was a period of relative silence for Marilyn Manson. The band spent over a year quietly writing and recording in a studio in Death Valley, with only the single Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes — an outtake from Antichrist Superstar — appearing during that time. On November 14, 2000, Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) was released. Returning to the darker, more abrasive sound of Antichrist Superstar, much of the album's content was written in response to the Columbine massacre. The album's third single, The Nobodies, was directly inspired by the shootings.

Described by the band as the third part of the trilogy begun with Antichrist Superstar and continued in Mechanical Animals, its overarching theme is an exploration of the relationship between death and fame in American culture, and its lyrics and artwork contain many references to John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald, John Lennon and Mark David Chapman, and even Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. The international ""Guns, God and Government Tour"" expanded upon the exploration of America's fascination with violence, and with the tour's logo – a rifle and handguns arranged to resemble the Christian cross — Manson made no attempt to conceal what he saw as the source of that fascination.

The band also revealed that within Marilyn Manson's massive concept album trilogy, Holy Wood serves as a prequel to Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar despite the latter two preceding Holy Wood in release date. Each of the three albums contain its own storyline distinct from one other but also linked together abstractly in a fourth larger overarching storyline encompassing all three. Manson has offered this much in the way of an interpretation: ""Holy Wood is about wanting to fit into a world that didn't want me, and fighting really hard to get there. The album's deepest elements are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with Holy Wood, then Mechanical Animals really talks about how that revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then Antichrist Superstar is where you're given a choice to decide if you're going to be controlled by the power that you created or if you want to destroy yourself and then start over. It just becomes a cycle.""

On May 16, 2001, Manson announced on the band website that he planned to quote the Bible at his next concert, to ""balance out"" his violent lyrics, ""so we can examine the virtues of wonderful Christian stories of disease, murder, adultery, suicide and child sacrifice. Now that seems like entertainment to me."" On June 21, 2001, Manson did indeed read from the Bible onstage in Denver, Colorado, presenting such passages as Leviticus 20:9 (""For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death"") and Psalm 137:9 (""Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones."")

This tour was documented in a DVD release of the same name, released October 29, 2002 and described by Manson as ""This will help you see what it's like to be nailed to this wrecking ball"" on the DVD packaging. In addition to a compilation style concert from the tour (songs from multiple individual shows edited to appear as single performance), the DVD includes a short thirty minute film titled ""Death Parade"" in the style of an All Access Pass for the tour.

Seven years later it was followed by Guns, God and Government – Live in L.A. Released in Blu-ray on November 17, 2009, it depicts the sixteen song set of the Los Angeles performance in its entirety.

The Golden Age of Grotesque: 2002-2003
With the ""triptych"" of the previous three albums now complete, Marilyn Manson was free to begin a fresh project. In 2002, Jonathan Davis of Korn invited Marilyn Manson into a studio to record vocals on a track he wrote titled Redeemer. The song, produced by both Jon and Richard Gibbs, was then released on the Queen of the Damned soundtrack. Marilyn Manson also released a music video for their cover of Soft Cell’s Tainted Love for the Not Another Teen Movie soundtrack. After finding inspiration in the decadent Swing era of the 1920s, the band recorded The Golden Age of Grotesque that year and the album was released on May 13, 2003.

Eschewing the lyrical depth and volume of symbolism and hidden meaning of Holy Wood, the new album was relatively straightforward; in an extended metaphor, Manson compares his own often-criticized music to the entartete Kunst banned by the Nazi regime. New member Tim Skold, replacing Twiggy Ramirez, added a new dimension to the band's sound; he brought with him from KMFDM the band's use of heavy industrial beats, influenced by the popular nu-metal sound at the time. The album debuted at No. 1 on the album charts, selling over 118,000 copies in the US its first week of release. It won a 2003 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for ""Album of the Year.""

Another world tour, the ""Grotesk Burlesk Tour"", followed, which furthered the album's Weimar Republic-inspired theme by adding elements of German Kabarett to the group's performances. Elaborate artwork by Gottfried Helnwein appeared in the band's stage dressing, and the members began appearing both on-stage and off- in designer suits and with fashion superstars.

Lest We Forget and Hiatus: 2004-2005
Lest We Forget: The Best Of was released on September 28, 2004. It was referred to by Manson as his ""farewell"" album when earlier that month, coinciding with Trent Reznor leaving New Orleans for the west coast, the Nine Inch Nails website officially announced ""nothing studios: 1994–2004"", suggesting that Nothing Studios was closed. This later proved to be the end of the associated vanity record label, as well as Manson's business association (effectively then shifting the band to a full Interscope contract) when Reznor successfully sued co-founder John Malm for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty (amongst others).

Lest We Forget was supported by a series of ""greatest hits"" performances on the ""Against All Gods Tour."" After the release of the single Personal Jesus, the band made a number of promotional appearances including a performance on MADtv; at one of these, the Comet awards show in Germany, drummer Ginger Fish fell from his drum riser, fracturing his skull and wrist. Former Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna replaced him; after recovering from the accident Fish had been recording and performing with a new band, Martyr Plot, before rejoining Marilyn Manson.

John 5 had also been replaced; Mark Chaussee of Fight took over lead guitar on the ""Against All Gods Tour,"" and was subsequently replaced in the studio by Tim Skold. Though John 5 denied any hostility towards Marilyn Manson following the announcement of his departure, at the band's appearance on the Rock am Ring music festival in 2003 an incident took place between John 5 and Marilyn Manson where Manson kicked and then shoved the guitarist. John 5 responded with anger, throwing off his guitar mid-song and raising his fists to Manson, before resuming the song. Lest We Forget was certified Gold in 2005.

Celebritarian Corporation: 2006
Beginning in January 2006, and continuing for some months, Marilyn Manson's official website was updated several times, adding new artwork and music, and making obtuse references to The Celebritarian Corporation, an art movement led by the frontman. Merchandise has since become available featuring logos such as the ""double cross"" (a variation on the Cross of Lorraine), as well as the slogans ""we will sell our shadow to those who stand within it"" and ""do not seek death; seek destruction.""

There were rumors about a new album all year long, but the frontman was focused on showcasing his watercolor artwork and sharing his ideas about his film Phantasmagoria. Marilyn Manson finally came back into the music world with their performance of This is Halloween - a cover for Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas at The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on October 31, 2006. This was the first performance since the Against All Gods tour ended in 2005, and the last performance with Madonna Wayne Gacy in the band. It was then that Manson started talking about his next album co-written with Tim Skold.

Eat Me, Drink Me: 2007-2008
Marilyn Manson's sixth studio album, Eat Me, Drink Me, was released on June 5, 2007, debuting at number 8 in the United States with more than 88,000 copies sold. Released more than four years after The Golden Age of Grotesque, Eat Me, Drink Me marked another drastic change in musical styles that the band has become famous for – opting for a more introspective direction. One remarkable note of the album is that it was written entirely by Manson and Skold in a rented home studio.

The album is also the first major label Manson album without Madonna Wayne Gacy (Pogo) as a listed member, making lead singer Marilyn Manson the only original member since Portrait of an American Family. Chris Vrenna, who temporarily replaced Ginger Fish on drums during the Against All Gods Tour, replaced Pogo to become the band's full-time keyboardist. Marilyn Manson co-headlined a tour with Slayer in order to promote the album with Bleeding Through as the opening act and Deadly Apples on select dates.

Rumors also circulated for some time that Marilyn Manson wrote the song Mutilation Is the Most Sincere Form of Flattery as an attack on the band My Chemical Romance. He later denied this, stating that it was aimed at people in general who sought to imitate him. In another interview Manson stated that ""I'm embarrassed to be me because these people are doing a really sad, pitiful, shallow version of what I've done."" In response to this, Gerard Way, the lead singer of My Chemical Romance claimed nothing Manson could say would bring the band down.

On January 9, 2008, Marilyn Manson posted a bulletin on MySpace confirming that former bassist Twiggy Ramirez had rejoined the band, resulting in the exit of Tim Skold. Skold and Manson had apparently began writing new material before the personnel change. Future collaborations with Skold were not ruled out.

The High End of Low: 2008-2009
The band's seventh full-length studio album began recording sessions following the conclusion of their ""Rape of the World Tour"" on March 2, 2008. On November 29, 2007, Marilyn Manson fansite ""The Heirophant"" reported that the frontman planned to start writing songs for the new record on January or February (2008). The actual recording took place at Manson's Hollywood Hills home between November 2008 and January 5, 2009. The last song, called 15, was completed on the evening of Manson's Jan 5 birthday—hence the name.

Manson said, ""after my greatest hits album Lest We Forget: The Best Of came out, I took a long break from music because it was a period where I was not sure who I wanted to be. I left music for a while but that's not an error I want to repeat in the future."" He mentioned Kerry King, James Iha, and Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs as likely contributors. 

During an exclusive interview titled Everyone Will Suffer Now at the now-defunct fansite MansonUSA (The Heirophant) on January 11, 2008, Manson shared, ""I just feel like there is a big change happening now. It's going to be the one. Eat Me, Drink Me is opening the window and this is going to be the Hurricane Katrina."" Since parting company with Skold and reuniting with Ramirez, the band had occupied themselves with work on the album to achieve their target of a February 2009 release. It was soon followed by the announcement of new tour dates. In an interview with Steppin' Out, Manson described the then-nascent record as, ""very ruthless, very heavy, and very violent.""

On August 14, 2008, Manson announced at a public interview in Seoul, Korea that former Limp Bizkit guitarist and current Black Light Burns frontman Wes Borland had joined the lineup, replacing Rob Holliday on guitars. The band attended the ETP Festival and were wrapping up production on the new album. However, Borland left a few months later to reunite with Limp Bizkit for the third time. Borland told UK's Kerrang Magazine that he quit after seeing none of the nine songs he wrote for the record make the final cut, and was extremely dissatisfied at the thought of being just a hired gun.

On October 5, the band played a special show at the annual Hot Topic managers meeting. The show took place at the Los Angeles International Airport's Marriott Hotel. During an after party for the 2008 Scream Awards, Manson was overheard comparing the new album to Antichrist Superstar and stating the album was ""pretty much finished."" He expected a new song to be released before the end of the year and expressed desire to release the record by Valentine's Day. 

In an interview on the February 2009 issue of Revolver Magazine, he revealed the title of two songs, namely, I Wanna Kill You Like They Do in the Movies and Armagoddamnmotherfuckinggeddon. The album's producer Sean Beavan, later posted a Myspace blog revealing two more song titles: 15 and Four Rusted Horses. Manson told Revolver ""I've got my fire back,"" and the record ""really wipes the floor with everything we've done before.""

A statement was released by Manson on Christmas Eve in order to dispel rumors that had been circulating regarding his relationship with Evan Rachel Wood and a speculated collaboration with rapper Ne-Yo. On January 12, a new song title was divulged by Rudy Coby, a collaborator and friend of the frontman. The song is called Devour and was said to be the album's first track.

It was announced that Marilyn Manson would perform with Slayer again as headliners for the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival tour in 2009. The press release for the tour stated that ""Manson is currently in the studio working on his seventh studio album scheduled for release May 18th on Interscope Records."" On February 2, Rolling Stone confirmed the album had been officially titled The High End of Low.

On March 18, 2009, Kerrang! reported that the album contained a total of 15 tracks and revealed another new song entitled We're from America. Manson said on the latter song, ""I think a lot of people will hear the track and initially think it's just political, but it's not just that, it's also me describing a lot of fucked-up scenarios that I'm going through in my personal life. Someone asked me, 'Why are you so fucked up?', 'Well, I am from America.' I hate the fact that so many people have fucked the country up, and so many people fucked up my personal life and I allowed it to happen. So in a way, I feel like America as a whole feels, but in no way does that make me a tree-hugging patriotic freedom rocker."" The track was released exclusively on the band's official website as a free download on March 27, 2009. On April 7, it became available for purchase as a digital single.

The album's official first single, Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin-Geddon, arrived in radio stations on April 21. It peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. On April 16, 2009, marilynmanson.com was updated with a new splash page featuring the projected album artwork as well as the track listing for The High End of Low. The record was released on May 26, 2009. It debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 with 49,000 copies sold. Despite reaching a higher charting position than Manson's prior studio effort Eat Me, Drink Me, which debuted at #8, it arrived with the lowest opening week sum of any of Manson's albums since The Last Tour on Earth opened with sales of 26,000 units in 1999.

After much fan speculation and no official announcement, Andy Gerold joined Marilyn Manson in the capacity of live bassist for ""The High End of Low Tour"" after former bassist Twiggy Ramirez switched to lead guitar duties. Gerold played his first show with the band on June 3, 2009, in Brno, Czech Republic. As of 2011, Gerold is still the youngest musician to play in the band, preceding former drummer Sara Lee Lucas by nearly seven years. During the summer of 2009, the band co-headlined the 2009 Mayhem Festival with Slayer. Later in October 2009, the band headlined the internationally advertised visual kei event, V-Rock Music festival.

Born Villain: 2010-2013
The eighth studio album by Marilyn Manson entered the writing phase during ""The High End of Low Tour"" in 2009. Bassist Twiggy projected a release date of 2011 through Cooking Vinyl Records and Marilyn Manson's own label Hell, etc. It is the band's first album since allowing their contract with Interscope Records to expire back in late 2009. Marilyn Manson attested that the lyrical content of the album would be ""more romantic"" yet ""self-abusive,"" and described the sonic elements of the record as ""suicide death metal.""

The prospect of an eighth studio album by the band was first confirmed by the frontman himself during an interview with Metal Hammer on December 3, 2009. He elaborated, ""We've just been released from our record contract with Interscope so I think a lot of the creative control on which my hands were tied on a lot of choices—the music videos—things like that. And the first example is the newest video, they clearly wouldn't have allowed me to make that video. So we started writing new songs on the road—a bit like David Bowie's album Aladdin Sane—I think people can expect a new record a lot sooner than we expected."" According to Chris Vrenna, by January 2010, the band was already ""talking and coming up with concepts"" for the album. On January 24, 2010, Manson confirmed on the band's official MySpace profile that ""the new album is officially in motion.""

In April 2010, during his appearance at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards, Manson divulged that the band had recorded 13 songs, one of which failed to appear in a television series about vampires. He referred to the album as ""very death metal"" and voiced interest in releasing the album differently from previous Marilyn Manson records. He also indicated his friendship with Slayer as a vague influence on the record. During an interview with Full Metal Jackie, he stated that the album was halfway finished.

On May 7, 2010, both entertainer Rudy Coby and The Nachtkabarett's Nick Kushner were previewed material from the album, the latter described it on Facebook as ""fuckin' hardcore."" Elaborating on the band's musical direction, Manson commented on Twiggy being influenced by his touring experiences in 2009, particularly during the Rockstar Mayhem Festival. Manson's father, Hugh Warner, described the album:

""It will make a vagina wet. What can you say after that? If the vagina's wet, all things are good. That's what he [Manson] told me when I was listening to it. It's very hard, very heavy, very good. Everyone should be extremely excited and happy.""

During an interview with Eric Blair on November 3, 2010, bassist Twiggy Ramirez indicated that the new album was ""almost done. It'll probably be out next year. It's our best record yet, I think. I mean, everyone always says that, but I think this is our best work so far... It's kind of like a little more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals without sounding too pretentious.""

For much of the early half of 2011, Marilyn Manson removed himself from the public spotlight and ceased almost all communication with his fans or the outside world. On February 24, 2011, the band's longtime drummer Ginger Fish announced his resignation from the group, prompting a search for a replacement. 

Meanwhile, on March 18, 2011, Marilyn Manson took a short break from his self-imposed sequestration by appearing in the music video for the song Tempat Ku by Brunei pop outfit D'Hask. On March 23, 2011, he uploaded new pictures onto the band's Facebook page, in a different style of previous photos. The new style suggested the 'new era' of Marilyn Manson had begun, further generating anticipation for the upcoming release.

On May 22, 2011, the band's website underwent a complete overhaul. A short 26 second snippet of a new song, tentatively titled, ""I am among no one (excerpt from an undisclosed song with an unreleased title)"" was uploaded to the redesigned main page along with a new logo to signify their eight studio album and the new era. The logo consisted of the letter M repeated four times in a spiral pattern, each with one long tail. At the end of the long tail is the Chinese trigram ☲ (離 lí) of the I Ching. Read lengthwise or up-and-down, it formed Hexagram 30, ""Radiance,"" also called ""the clinging"" and ""the net."" 

The origin of the character is rooted in symbols of long-tailed birds such as the peacock or the legendary phoenix. The CMYK coloring was also notable with regard to an acrostic formed by Manson, in a journal entry that accompanied the site changes, which spelled out the words ""Christianity Manufactures Yesterdays Killers.""

On June 3, 2011 the Brazilian edition of the Portuguese broadsheet newspaper Destak confirmed that agents for the band had finalized negotiations for the group to tour in Brazil and other South American countries as part of the SWU Music & Arts Festival beginning on the second week of November 2011. The Brazilian music festival also saw a change in venue for 2011. While organizers have yet to finalize details, it was speculated that the event may be held at the São Paulo municipality of Paulínia. 

Manson appeared live via the Ustream broadcast of Fleischer's Universe on June 21, 2011, where he announced that the new album title will be revealed within a week. He also divulged the following lyrics, ""The center of the universe cannot exist if there are no edges"", of a yet to be released song. The album title was not, in fact, revealed within a week, but was announced on September 1 as Born Villain via Twitter.

After being impressed by his directorial work on one of Kid Cudi's music videos, Marilyn Manson employed the actor Shia LaBeouf to work on the album artwork as well as create a ""making-of"" video documenting the album's recording and production.

On November 22, 2011, it was announced that Chris Vrenna had officially left the band after contributing to the writing and production of Born Villain.

Two months prior to release, the band begun to support the album with the Hey Cruel World... Tour. On May 1, 2012, Born Villain was released worldwide. It debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200, No. 3 on Top 100 Rock albums, and No. 1 on both Top Independent Albums and Hard Rock Albums. Marilyn Manson continued touring for the album by performing joint concerts with Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper on the Twins of Evil Tour and Masters of Madness Tour.

The Pale Emperor: 2013-2016
Marilyn Manson started production for his ninth studio album in 2013. In early 2014, drummer Gil Sharone of Stolen Babies revealed he had been working on the new album since November. Manson premiered Cupid Carries a Gun on April 27 when it was used as the opening theme to the television series Salem. The song was composed and produced alongside Tyler Bates, who was also confirmed to act as co-producer for the upcoming album.

The song was described by Manson as ""the last track we finished for my new album,"" indicating that he had completed production for his next studio album. On June 25, bassist Fred Sablan confirmed he had left the band, on good terms, and was replaced by Twiggy for their summer tour, with Tyler Bates to take over as lead guitarist and Paul Wiley as a live rhythm guitarist.

The band completed a Summer tour in Europe, and a second new song entitled Killing Strangers premiered in the film John Wick on October 24. It was announced that another track would be released soon. Momentarily after it premiered on BBC Radio 1, the third new song (and first digital single) entitled Third Day of a Seven Day Binge was released as a free download at Marilyn Manson's official website on October 26. It was accompanied with a new video and MM logo.

The band performed several new songs live for the first time in October and early November, when they played a handful of concerts around southern California. An early 2015 North American tour called The Hell Not Hallelujah tour was announced shortly afterwards. The band also announced multiple festival dates in Australia, United States, and Europe.

On December 5, Manson settled a fifteen year rift with The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, by performing Third Day of a Seven Day Binge and Ava Adore with the band at the Camden Palace Theatre in London. This is the second time Manson has done guest vocals at a Smashing Pumpkins show. The first time, Manson and Twiggy performed Eye and The Beautiful People with the original Smashing Pumpkins in October 1997 at the Bridge School Benefit in Los Angeles, CA.

A fourth new track called Deep Six was released on YouTube through Marilyn Manson's official website on December 14. The track was released as a single on December 16, while a double A-sided CD single of Third Day of a Seven Day Binge with Deep Six was released exclusively at Best Buy on December 23. Cupid Carries a Gun was released as the third digital single from The Pale Emperor on January 7, 2015.

The ninth album entitled The Pale Emperor was released on January 19 (UK) - January 20 (US), 2015. Marilyn Manson went on their seventeenth world tour in January to support the new album. Guitarist Tyler Bates departed from the Hell Not Hallelujah tour in April to focus on film and television projects. Live guitarist Paul Wiley assumed his role as lead guitarist. In the summer of 2015, the band co-headlined with The Smashing Pumpkins on the End Times tour in North America. In the summer of 2016, Tyler Bates returned to the band as they went on a North American tour with Slipknot.

John Legend,"John Stephens (born December 28, 1978 in Springfield, Ohio), better known as John Legend, is a Grammy award winning R&B singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, poet and actor signed to Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music label. Prior to the release of his debut album Get Lifted in 2004, Legend's career gained momentum through a series of successful collaborations with multiple established artists such as Jay-Z, Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill. He released his second album, Once Again in 2006, and his latest release, 2008's Evolver showcased a more experimental and upbeat side of Legend. He is the recipient of six Grammy Awards, and in 2007 he received the special Starlight award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Legend also played the piano on Lauryn Hill's 1998 song ""Everything is Everything"" and sang background vocals on Jay-Z's ""Encore"" and Alicia Keys' ""You Don't Know My Name"". Legend frequently cites gospel, R&B, and hip hop music as his main musical influences.

Legend released his critically acclaimed and Billboard Top Ten second album, Once Again, in October 2006.  Produced by Raphael Saadiq, Kanye West and will.i.am, it is again a mixture of gospel and classic soul showcasing his extraordinary voice, particularly on ""Show Me"".

Grammy Award Wins:
*2005 Best New Artist
*2005 Best Male R&B Vocal Performance: ""Ordinary People""
*2005 Best R&B Album- Get Lifted
*2007 Best Male R&B Vocal Performance: Heaven
*2007 Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group: Family Affair

Neo-soul singer and pianist John Legend combined the raw fervor of contemporaries Cody ChesnuTT and the burning precision of D'Angelo. Born John Stephens, Legend was a child prodigy who grew up in Ohio, where he began singing gospel and playing piano at the tender age of five. Legend left Ohio at 16 to attend college in Philadelphia, and it was there that he first found a larger audience. Not yet out of his teens, Legend was tapped to play piano on Lauryn Hill's ""Everything Is Everything"" in 1998. After completing college, he moved to New York, where he began to build a loyal following playing in nightclubs and releasing CDs that he would sell at shows. He also became an in-demand session musician, playing and occasionally writing for a wide array of artists, including Alicia Keys, Twista, Janet Jackson, and Kanye West. It wasn't until West signed the young talent to his new label that he adopted the Legend name with 2004's Solo Sessions Vol. 1: Live at the Knitting Factory. Get Lifted, his first studio album, was released later in the year. On the strength of enduring single ""Ordinary People,"" the album reached the Top Five of the Billboard 200. This led to three Grammy Awards: Best R&B Album, Best R&B Male Vocal Performance, and Best New Artist. Once Again, which peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and number one on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, followed in October 2006. Live from Philadelphia, sold exclusively at Target stores, was a successful stopgap release that predated October 2008's Evolver.

Panic! at the Disco,"Panic! at the Disco is  American rock band hailing from Las Vegas, Nevada. The current member is vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Brendon Urie. Their debut album A Fever You Can't Sweat Out has sold over 2.2 million copies worldwide, 1.5 million of which were in the United States alone. This shot them into the international spotlight. Their sophomore album Pretty. Odd. debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200.  The band released their third album, entitled Vices & Virtues, on March 22, 2011, while the record's first single, ""The Ballad of Mona Lisa"" was released February 1, 2011.

Although the band officially formed as Panic! at the Disco in 2004, the first incarnation of the band was formed in 2002 under the name ""Pet Salamander"", with Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson, and Trevor Howell. It was during this time that Ryan Ross wrote ""Time To Dance"" and ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"", so some consider the band to have formed as of 2002.

In 2005, Panic! at the Disco, which at the time included Urie, Smith, guitarist/lyricist Ryan Ross, and bassist Brent Wilson, was discovered by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy, who, after hearing demos the band uploaded to PureVolume went to Las Vegas to hear the band play in their garage. He immediately signed them to his Fueled By Ramen label imprint Decaydance. After their debut A Fever You Can't Sweat Out was released, bassist Brent Wilson left the band. Although he claims he was fired, the other members deny this.

The success of their first two singles helped catapult their debut album to the top of the Billboard Independent chart and to #13 on the Billboard 200 in July 2006. With Jon Walker filling in as temporary bassist, the band embarked on their first headlining tour through Europe. All of the dates sold out within hours. Immediately after returning, they did the same in North America. On July 3, Jon Walker became the permanent bassist of Panic! at the Disco.

In early 2007, Panic! at the Disco began writing their follow up album but, after months of work, decided to rewrite the entire album from scratch in July 2007. While speaking to MTV, Ryan Ross explained that, before the decision to start over was made, the album had lacked a band set up and that it ""sounded like a film score."" He also explained that the new songs have ""a more positive outlook to them."" On January 9, the exclamation point (!) in the band's name was dropped. They defended the decision to drop the exclamation point during an interview with MTV: ""It was never part of the name to us. (...) When we started doing new promo stuff for this album, we just told everyone not to use it anymore."" Panic (sans ""!"") later confirmed that the second album was titled Pretty. Odd. with a release date of March 25, 2008.

On July 6th, 2009, an announcement was put up on the band's official website and myspace page, stating that Ryan Ross and Jon Walker would be leaving the band to pursue their own musical interests. They have since formed the band The Young Veins. 

Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith, however, will stay and continue playing as Panic! at the Disco, with the exclamation point re-added. Fans can hear a snippet of Panic!'s demo entitled ""Oh Glory"" on the band's official website. 

Since the split, Panic! at the Disco joined Fall Out Boy, Blink-182, and Chester French on the first half of Blink-182's summer tour in 2009. They brought along Ian Crawford formerly of The Cab and Dallon Weekes of The Brobecks to temporarily replace Ross and Walker. The band also released a single titled New Perspective which was featured on the Jennifer's Body Soundtrack in August 2009.

""New Perspective"" was released on July 28, 2009.[26] Former The Cab member Ian Crawford filled in for Ross on their tour during the summer of 2009. Dallon Weekes, singer/songwriter of the indie band The Brobecks, filled in for Walker on bass on the tour as well.[27]

The band re-entered the studio during early 2010 and spent much of the year recording their third studio album.[20] On January 18, 2011, the band revealed that their new album, Vices & Virtues, would officially be released on March 22, 2011. The album was produced by Butch Walker and John Feldmann.[28] The record's first single, ""The Ballad of Mona Lisa"", was released digitally on February 1, 2011, with the music video being released February 8, 2011. The band played 2 new, unheard songs ""Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)"" and ""Let's Kill Tonight"" at recent concerts. On March 9, 2011, Panic! at The Disco released a short film titled ""The Overture"" which featured snippets of four, unheard songs: ""Let's Kill Tonight"", ""Hurricane"", ""Ready to Go (Get Me Out of My Mind)"", and ""Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)"". On March 14, 2011, Panic! at The Disco streamed the full Vices & Virtues album on their Facebook page. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Panic%21+at+the+Disco"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Jimmy Eat World,"Jimmy Eat World formed in Mesa, Arizona, United States in 1993. They are associated with an array of genres including emo, alternative rock, indie rock and pop punk. Singer/guitarist Jim Adkins and drummer Zach Lind, who had been friends since kindergarten, joined forces with co-vocalist/guitarist Tom Linton and bass player Mitch Porter to try their hand at music. In its early years the band emulated the style of their punk rock influences, and they eventually recorded and released three singles and a full-length, self-titled album on local label Wooden Blue Records.

The name Jimmy Eat World did not refer to lead singer Jim Adkins. Tom Linton's younger siblings, Ed and Jimmy, fought constantly when they were younger. Jimmy, who was stronger and heavier, would usually win. On one instance, Ed, as revenge, drew a picture with crayons of Jimmy shoving the entire world into his gaping mouth with the caption, ""Jimmy eat world."" The picture, and by extension the band name, may have been inspired by an episode of the cartoon show 'Tiny Toon Adventures', where the main characters put on a student film festival. Dizzy Devil's film, ""Dizzy Eat World"", was a 5 second piece drawn crudely in crayon where Dizzy's gaping jaw engulfed the Earth.

In 1995 the band signed to Capitol Records. Around this time bass player Mitch parted ways with the band and was replaced by Linton's friend Rick Burch.  After a brief scouting for producers, the band joined up with Drive Like Jehu drummer Mark Trombino to record their debut album Static Prevails.

In 1998 the band entered the studio again to record their follow-up, Clarity. Clarity was released in 1999, the band released a video for Lucky Denver Mint, which also featured on the soundtrack for the film Never Been Kissed. The band was dropped by Capitol in 1999. They released Singles in 2000 and some splits. In 2001 working for a third time with Trombino, the band recorded the album Bleed American. After searching for a new label, they eventually signed with Dreamworks. The completed album was released in July 2001. The current issue of the CD originally known as Bleed American was re-released as Jimmy Eat World after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Four singles were released: Bleed American, The Middle (Reached #5 on the Billboard Hot 100), Sweetness (Reached #75) and A Praise Chorus (Reached #16 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart). The song The Authority Song was used as the theme music for the popular teen film 'Van Wilder'. The Middle landed Jimmy Eat World in the mainstream,and while Sweetness did a little worse, it still found success. Bleed American went platinum in a few months.

After lengthy touring in support of Bleed American the band regrouped to work on the follow-up in early 2004. Once again the band joined up with Trombino but the collaboration was short-lived. The band decided to part ways with Trombino, instead bringing in producer Gil Norton, well-known for his work with Pixies and Foo Fighters. Futures was released in October 2004 with lead single Pain immediately finding success in alternative radio and reaching #93 on the Billboard Hot 100. By this time, Dreamworks had been acquired by the much larger Interscope. Work and Futures became the other two singles to be released from the album, reaching #3 and #27 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart respectively. Simultaneous to the album launch was the release of a deluxe edition which  included both the original album and demo versions of the same tracks. Additional demos from the Trombino sessions were later made available through the Jimmy Eat World Message Board, two of which, entitled Coming Home and Lying Dressed, would later become Disintegration and Closer, both of which featured on the Stay On My Side Tonight EP. Futures went gold by the end of 2004.

In 2004, the song Just Tonight appeared on the Electronic Arts video game ""Burnout 3"", and later that year Pain appeared on the Activision title; ""Tony Hawk's Underground 2"" as well as Rockstar's ""Midnight Club 3"".

The band later released an EP entitled Stay On My Side Tonight, released online on September 13, 2005, and on CD on October 4 of the same year. The EP featured songs recorded with producer Landon Stark as (unused) demos for the Futures album, as well as a cover of the Heatmiser song, Half Right and a remixed version of the song Drugs Or Me from the Futures album.

After a lengthy tour with Green Day, a joint-headliner with Taking Back Sunday across the US and sold-out concerts in Europe, Australia and Japan, the band regrouped to begin writing the follow-up to Futures in February 2006. A video series entitled 'A World of Adventure' was made available through the band's website during the tour, focusing mainly on guitarist Tom Linton.

Recording sessions for Jimmy Eat World's album, Chase This Light began on August 7, 2006. After a lengthy writing and recording period the mixing for this album began in June 2007. The lead single, Big Casino, was released on August 28 and the album itself on October 16. The album debuted at #5 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart selling about 62,000 copies in its first week. It also contains the song Carry You, originally written for Jim Adkins' side project, Go Big Casino.

The song Electable (Give It Up) from their 2007 album Chase This Light features in the Electronic Arts game ""Burnout Paradise"".

The band's seventh album, Invented, was released on 28th September 2010 with the second track, My Best Theory, being released as a digital download single on 10th August 2010. The reception was good and sold just under 40,000 units in the first week. It's the first album that contains a song sung by guitarist Tom Linton since Clarity.

After having troubles finding a label, Jimmy Eat World eventually released their eight album, Damage, on 10th June 2013, with the track ""I Will Steal You Back"" released as a single and ""Damage"" released on Record Store Day along with a cover of ""Stop Whispering"" by Radiohead.

In 2014 they went on a world tour to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of their hit album Futures, playing it from start to finish.

Elton John,"Sir Elton Hercules John, CBE (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight in Pinner, Middlesex, England on 25 March 1947) is an immensely popular English singer, composer (mostly with lyricist Bernie Taupin) and pianist. In a career spanning five decades, Elton John has sold over 250 million records and has over fifty Top 40 hits, making him one of the most successful musicians of all time. His 1997 tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, "" Candle In The Wind 1997,"" remains the world's biggest selling and fastest selling single of all time.

In 1964, Dwight and his friends formed a band called Bluesology. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American soul and R&B musicians like The Isley Brothers, Major Lance, Billy Stewart, Doris Troy and Patti LaBelle and The Bluebelles. In 1966, the band became musician Long John Baldry's supporting band and played 16 times at The Marquee Club.

John was one of the dominant commercial forces in the rock world during the 1970s, with a string of seven consecutive #1 records on the U.S. album charts, twenty-three Top 40 singles, sixty Top 10 hits, and six #1 hits. His success had a profound impact on popular music, and contributed to the continued popularity of the piano in rock and roll. 

Key musical elements in John's success included his melodic gifts matched with the contributions of his lyricist partner Bernie Taupin, his rich tenor and gospel-chorded piano, aggressive string arrangements, his flamboyant fashion sense and on-stage showmanship. As told by himself, his somewhat ""flashy"" outfits were due to the fact that he sits behind the piano and would otherwise vanish on stage.

John was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and knighted in 1998.  He has helped lead the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s.  In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked John #49 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.  He continues to be a major public figure. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Of Monsters and Men,"Of Monsters and Men are an indie folk band which formed in 2010 in Keflavík/Garðabær, Iceland. The band consists of Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir (vocals, guitar), Ragnar Þórhallsson (vocals, guitar), Brynjar Leifsson (guitar), Kristján Páll Kristjánsson (bass), Arnar Rósenkranz Hilmarsson (drums) and the former member  Árni Guðjónsson (keyboards, accordion), who left the band in 2012. The band released their debut album ""My Head Is an Animal"" in September 2011. The album's single ""Little Talks"" peaked at #1 in Iceland, and became successful in the United States after extensive airplay on Philadelphia rock station WRFF and subsequent word of mouth. In April 2012 the tune became their first entry on the US singles chart, when it entered the Billboard Hot 100 at #92.

Leonard Cohen,"Leonard Cohen (b. 21st September 1934 in Montréal, Quebec) is a Canadian poet, novelist and musician. His musical career has largely overshadowed his prior work as a poet and novelist, although he continued to publish poetry sporadically after his breakthrough in the music industry.

In 1967, disappointed with his lack of financial success as a writer, Cohen moved to the United States to pursue a career as a folk music singer-songwriter. During the 1960s, he was a fringe figure in Andy Warhol's ""Factory"" crowd. Warhol speculated that Cohen had spent time listening to Nico in clubs and that this had influenced his musical style. His song ""Suzanne"" became a hit for Judy Collins and was for many years his most covered song. After performing at a few folk festivals, he came to the attention of Columbia Records representative John H. Hammond who signed Cohen to a record deal.

Musically, Cohen's early songs are based in folk music, in terms of both melody and instrumentation; from the 1970s, though, his work begins to show the influence of various types of popular and cabaret music. Since the 1980s he has typically sung in a deep bass register, accompanied by synthesisers and female backing vocals.

Despite not embarking on a tour since 1993, Cohen was forced to go on the road in 2008, following the alleged misappropriation of over five million U.S. dollars from his retirement by his longtime former manager, Kelley Lynch. This left him close to bankruptcy, and Cohen's mammoth world tour lasted two and a half years and included 246 shows.

Cohen's songs are often emotionally heavy and lyrically complex, owing more to the metaphoric word play of poetry than to established conventions of songcraft. His work often explores the themes of religion, isolation, and complex interpersonal relationships.

Cohen's music has greatly influenced other singer-songwriters, and more than a thousand cover versions of his works have been recorded. He is also popular in his native land, having been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and awarded the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Leonard+Cohen"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rage Against the Machine,"Rage Against the Machine is an American rap metal band, formed in 1991 in Los Angeles, California. The band's line-up comprises vocalist Zack de la Rocha, guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk. Critics have noted Rage Against the Machine for its ""fiercely polemical music, which brewed sloganeering leftist rants against corporate America, cultural imperialism, and government oppression into a Molotov cocktail of hardcore punk, hip hop, alternative metal, and funk."" Rage Against the Machine drew inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation, as well as rap acts such as Afrika Bambaataa, Public Enemy and Beastie Boys.

In 1992, the band released its self-titled debut album, which became a commercial success, leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza. The band did not release a follow-up record until 1996, with Evil Empire. The band's third album The Battle of Los Angeles was released in 1999. During their initial nine year run, they became one of the most popular and influential political bands in contemporary music.

Shortly after breaking up in 2000, the band released the cover album Renegades. De la Rocha & Morello both started low-key solo careers; the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, then-former frontman of Soundgarden, which disbanded in 2007, and in April of that year, Rage Against the Machine performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The band has continued to perform at many live venues and festivals around the world since 2007 but have not recorded any new studio material, as of yet.

Due to a popular Facebook Campaign in 2009, the band managed to beat Joe McElderry, winner of the X Factor 2009, to the UK Christmas number one spot. This broke the chain of X Factor winners reaching the Christmas number one spot. To celebrate, Rage Against The Machine held a free gig to show their gratitude towards their fans. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rage+Against+the+Machine"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

OutKast,"OutKast is an American hip-hop duo from Atlanta, Georgia, United States.  The duo is one of the most successful hip-hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards.   Over 25 million copies have been sold of Outkast's seven releases: six studio albums—including one double album—and a greatest hits release. 

The group's original musical style was a mixture of Dirty South and G-Funk.  Since then funk, soul, pop, electronic music, rock, spoken word poetry, jazz, and blues have been added to the group's musical palette. The duo consists of Atlanta native André ""Andre 3000"" Benjamin (formerly known as Dré) and Georgia-born Antwan ""Big Boi"" Patton.

Speakerboxxx/The Love Below is one of only four hip-hop albums to be certified Diamond in the U.S. for shipping over 10 million units.  Along with Outkast's commercial success, they have maintained an experimental approach in their music and are widely praised for their originality and artistic content.

Benjamin and Patton met while attending Tri-Cities High School, a Visual and Performing Arts School. Benjamin's parents were divorced and he was living with his father. Meanwhile, Patton had to move with his four brothers and six sisters from Savannah to Atlanta. Benjamin and Patton eventually teamed up and were pursued by Organized Noize, a group of local producers who would later make hits for TLC. The duo initially wanted to be called ""2 Shades Deep"" or ""The Misfits"", but because those names were already taken they later decided to use ""OutKast"" based on finding ""outcast"" as synonym for ""misfit"" in a dictionary.  OutKast, Organized Noize, and schoolmates Goodie Mob formed the nucleus of the Dungeon Family organization.

OutKast signed to LaFace Records in 1992, becoming the label's first hip hop act and making their first appearance on the remix of label mate TLC's ""What About Your Friends"".  In 1993, they released their first single, ""Player's Ball"".  The song's funky style, much of it accomplished with live instrumentation, was a hit with audiences.  ""Player's Ball"" hit number-one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart.

Their debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, was issued on April 26th, 1994.  This initial effort is credited with laying the foundation for southern hip hop and is considered a classic by many hip hop aficionados.  Every track on Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was produced by Organized Noize and featured other members of the Dungeon Family.  Follow-up singles included the title track and ""Git Up Git Out"", a politically charged collaboration with Goodie Mob that was later sampled by Macy Gray for her 1999 hit ""Do Something.""  On this early material, both André and Big Boi contrast lyrical content reflecting the lifestyles of pimps and gangsters with politically conscious material commenting on the status of African Americans in the South. OutKast won Best New Rap Group at the Source Awards in 1995.  In the same year, the group contributed ""Benz or a Beamer"" to the popular New Jersey Drive soundtrack.

ATLiens was OutKast's second album, released on August 27th, 1996.  The album exhibited more self-consciousness, and further solidified OutKast as the flagship representatives of the 1st generation Dungeon Family and the Southern hip hop movement.  The album helped the group earn more recognition among East Coast hip hop fans in the East and West coasts.

For this album, OutKast joined with partner David ""Mr. DJ"" Sheats to form the Earthtone III production company, which allowed the group to produce some of their own tracks.  ""ATLiens"" was the group's second Top 40 single (following ""Player's Ball"" from their first album), and reflected the beginning of André's increasingly sober lifestyle:  ""No drugs or alcohol/so I can get the signal clear,"" he rhymes about himself. ""Elevators (Me & You),"" OutKast's first self-produced single, became the group's first Top 20 hit the same year.

OutKast's third album Aquemini was released on September 29, 1998 and also reached the number-two position on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States; its title was a combination of the zodiac signs of Big Boi (an Aquarius) and André (a Gemini).  The album was widely praised as possibly the group's best material to date: when reviewed by popular hip-hop publication The Source, it received the much-coveted ""5 Mics"" (out of five) rating.

Producing more material themselves, both Big Boi and André explored more eclectic subject matter, delving into sounds inspired by soul, trip hop, and electro music.  The album featured production by Organized Noize and collaborations with Raekwon, funk pioneer and musical forebear George Clinton, and Goodie Mob.

In 1999, OutKast and LaFace Records were sued by Rosa Parks over the album's most successful radio single, which bore Parks' name as its title. The lawsuit alleged that the song misappropriated Parks' name, and also objected to some of the song's obscene language.

The song's lyrics were largely unrelated to Parks, save for a line in the chorus: ""Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus"".  The song, which OutKast maintained was intended partly as homage, only refers to Parks as a metaphor: the purpose of the song's chorus is to imply that OutKast is overturning hip hop's old order, that people should make way for a new style and sound.  The initial lawsuit was dismissed. Parks' representation hired lawyer Johnnie Cochran to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied on First Amendment grounds.  In 2003, the Supreme Court allowed Parks' lawyers to proceed with the lawsuit.

In 2004, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyers were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest.  Later that same year, the members of OutKast were dropped as co-defendants, and Parks' lawyers continued to seek action against LaFace and parent company BMG. In 2003 André told UK journalist Angus Batey that, following a Detroit concert in the midst of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case was less to do with Rosa than with the lawyers.  The suit was finally settled on April 14, 2005, with neither OutKast nor their label having to admit any wrongdoing. The group did, however, have to agree to perform some sort of tribute to Parks.

Originally titled ""Sandbox"", the pair's fourth album, ""Stankonia"", was released in October 2000 to excellent reviews.  It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., and would eventually be certified quadruple-platinum.  Stankonia's first single was ""B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)"", a high-tempo jungle-influenced record.  The second single, ""Ms. Jackson,"" combined a pop hook with lyrics about divorce and relationship breakups, particularly André's breakup with singer Erykah Badu; the titular ""Ms. Jackson"" character being a doppelgänger for Badu's mother.  It was at this time that André changed his stage name to the current ""André 3000"".

The single became their first pop hit, landing the number-one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the number-two position on the UK Singles Chart.  The album's final single was the Organized Noize-produced ""So Fresh, So Clean"", featuring a credited guest appearance from regular guest vocalist and Organized Noize-member Sleepy Brown and garnered a remix featuring Snoop Dogg.   All three singles' videos had heavy MTV2 airplay, and Outkast won two 2001 Grammy Awards, one for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for ""Ms. Jackson"", and another for Stankonia as Best Rap Album.

During the recording of Stankonia, OutKast and Mr. DJ began producing tracks for the artists on their Aquemini Records imprint through Columbia, including Slimm Cutta Calhoun and Killer Mike, who made his debut on Stankonia's ""Snappin' & Trappin.""

Webzine Pitchforkmedia.com named Stankonia the 4th greatest album released between 2000 and 2004 in its 2005 feature.  In 2009, B.O.B. was chosen as the number one song of the decade.

In December 2001, OutKast released a greatest hits album, Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast, which also contained three new tracks. One of these new tracks was the single ""The Whole World,"" which won a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Killer Mike also was featured on the song, gaining some exposure among areas outside of his native Atlanta. The other two new songs were called ""Funkin' Around"" and ""Movin' Cool (The After Party)""

The same year OutKast participated in the only Dungeon Family group album, Even in Darkness, along with Goodie Mob, Killer Mike, Sleepy Brown, Witchdoctor, and Backbone among others, and featuring Bubba Sparxxx, Shuga Luv and Mello.  In 2002, the group and Killer Mike contributed the lead single ""Land of a Million Drums"" to the Scooby Doo soundtrack.

In September 2003, OutKast released a double album, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.  It is essentially two solo albums, one by each member, packaged as a single release under the OutKast banner; the two members also appear on each others' discs for a few songs apiece.  Big Boi's Speakerboxxx is largely a funk and Dirty South blended party record; André 3000's The Love Below features only brief instances of hip hop, presenting instead elements found in funk, jazz, rock, electronic music, and R&B.

The album is also OutKast's biggest commercial success yet, having debuted on the Billboard 200 albums chart at number-one and stayed there for several weeks.  The album eventually sold over five million copies, and, as double-album sales count double for Recording Industry Association of America certification, the album was certified diamond for 10 million units shipped in December 2004. Its latest certification, in May 2006, reaches 11 million copies in shipping.

The first two singles from the album(s), which were released nearly simultaneously, were Big Boi's ""The Way You Move"" and André 3000's ""Hey Ya!""   The video for ""Hey Ya!"" is based on The Beatles' landmark appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The video's storyline has ""The Love Below""—a fictional band with all members, through the use of special effects, played by André—performing in London.  ""Hey Ya!"" was the number one song on the very final weekend of American Top 40 with Casey Kasem.  It was also number one a week later on the very first weekend of American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest.   The singles spent ten weeks at number one on the Hot 100 singles chart, with ""Hey Ya!"" spending nineteen weeks and ""The Way You Move"" briefly taking over in February 2004.   These singles were seen as a breakthrough for the hip-hop industry, being among the first hip-hop songs to be widely played on adult contemporary radio stations.

OutKast's next official single was not released until the summer of 2004.  ""Roses"", a track featuring both members from The Love Below half of the album, did not meet the level of success as either of its predecessors, but it became a modest-sized hit on urban radio and the American music video networks. The video for ""Roses"" is loosely based on the musical West Side Story and Grease.  It featured sparring 1950s-style gangs, one representing Speakerboxxx, and one representing The Love Below, parodying the widespread arguing among critics and fans as to which half of the album was better and that the two members were estranged.   The final singles were André 3000's ""Prototype"", which was paired with a science fiction-themed video about alien visitors, and Speakerboxxx's ""Ghettomusick,"" which featured both members of OutKast and a sample from a song by Patti LaBelle, who also makes an appearance in the video.

Speakerboxxx/The Love Below won the Grammy Award for the 2004 Album of the Year, becoming only the second rap album to ever receive the honor (the first being The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill by Lauryn Hill in 1999).  OutKast was one of the headlining acts at the show, and gave two performances: Big Boi performed ""The Way You Move"" during a medley with George Clinton & P-Funk and Robert Randolph and the Family Band, while André 3000 performed ""Hey Ya!"" as the show closed.   In February 2004, André 3000's performance, which featured female dancers moving wildly around a green teepee in war paint and feathered headdresses, was criticized by the Native American Cultural Center, who called for a boycott of OutKast, Arista Records, NARAS, and of CBS, the broadcaster of the awards show. CBS later apologized.

Between OutKast albums, Big Boi and André 3000 ventured into film projects.   André co-starred in John Singleton's action film Four Brothers and also had a part in Be Cool, while Big Boi took a featured role in the T.I. movie ATL.  Both members also began working on a joint film, Idlewild, directed by OutKast music video director Bryan Barber.   Idlewild, a Prohibition-era musical film set to a blues-influenced hip-hop soundtrack, was released on August 25, 2006 by Universal Pictures.   The Idlewild soundtrack was released August 22, 2006.   Its lead single, ""Mighty 'O'"", features both OutKast members, and was briefly played exclusively on local Atlanta radio stations before being issued as a single in May 2006. They released and shot the video for ""Morris Brown"" instead.   A video for ""Idlewild Blue (Don'tchu Worry About Me)"" soon followed.

Aquemini Records folded in 2004, and Big Boi founded a new record label, Purple Ribbon Entertainment, to be distributed by Virgin Records.   Among its first signees were Sleepy Brown, Bubba Sparxxx, and Killer Mike, Big Boi has released a group album/compilation, titled Big Boi Presents... The Purple Ribbon All-Stars - Got Purp? Vol. 2.

One album remains on the band's LaFace contract.   It was originally planned as a ten-track release called 10 The Hard Way; shortly after Idlewild was released, the duo confirmed the album is still in the works, though both have begun new projects without releasing any new information on the album.   Due to both Big Boi and André's interest in separate projects such as movies, TV (André's Class of 3000) and solo albums, rumors of a split have turned up frequently in the media.   André denied those rumors in a phone interview with MTV News, stating that even though they do not feel like performing on stage together, OutKast is ""still tight"".   In an August, 2006, interview with UK journalist Craig McLean, after emphasizing that they would not split, the pair looked beyond music and film careers, Big Boi suggesting he may consider running for the job of Mayor of Atlanta in the future.

In 2007, Andre 3000 confirmed a new OutKast album would be released, but said that he and Big Boi released solo records first, stating the group album is still possibly two years away.  Big Boi's solo album will be released first in June/July of 2009, with the first single, ""Royal Flush"" (also featuring Andre 3000, essentially making it an OutKast song), planned to have been released on December 31, 2007, but was not released on the announced date.   Big Boi announced on his MySpace that the release date for Sir Luscious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty is now sometime in the summer of 2009.

On Nov 14, 2008, the Guardian reported that OutKast will release their follow-up to Idlewild in 2009 after Big Boi and Andre 3000 release their solo albums in the same year.  As of August 2009, the albums have not yet been released.

Disturbed,"There are several acts by the name of Disturbed;

1) Well-known American hard rock band with lead singer David Draiman, formed in 1996, with several albums including The Sickness (Giant/Reprise 2000), Believe (Giant/Reprise 2002), Ten Thousand Fists (Reprise, 2005), Indestructible (Reprise, 2008), Asylum (Reprise, 2010), and Immortalized (Reprise, 2015).

4) OC ReMixer Mark Dillon
5) hard house

Also see The Disturbed

1) Disturbed was formed in 1996 when musicians Dan Donegan, Steve Kmak, and Mike Wengren hired singer David Draiman in Chicago, Illinois. They have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, and released four consecutive #1 debuts a feat achieved by only two other rock bands in the history of the chart: Metallica and Dave Matthews Band. Originally classified as a nu metal band, Disturbed is now regarded by some music critics as hard rock or heavy metal, although others now regard them as nu metal. However, the band's genre is still being debated. When asked about die-hard metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, frontman David Draiman stated:

""We probably have too much melody going on or we're not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it's not what we try to do. If we have to place things in context, we're more hard rock than heavy metal these days.""

Early Days, The Sickness
In their early years, Disturbed started recording several demos and played live shows. Not long after, in 2000, the band released their debut album, titled The Sickness, which launched the band into stardom. The song Down With the Sickness became extremely popular and was later used in many film soundtracks. Soon after the release of ""The Sickness"", Disturbed released a revamped cover version of ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin's theme music for WWF called ""Glass Shatters"". Disturbed headlined the Ozzfest tour in 2001 alongside Black Sabbath, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Papa Roach, Linkin Park, Black Label Society, and Crazy Town. Afterward, the band started their own tour, called Music as a Weapon. The bands Adema, Drowning Pool, Stereomud, and Systematic were featured on the tour alongside Disturbed.

Before joining Marilyn Manson's 2001 European tour, Disturbed's bassist Steve ""Fuzz"" Kmak was unable to play with the band due to a shattered ankle. Fuzz injured his ankle by falling out of a fire escape outside Disturbed's rehearsal hall in Chicago a few days before Christmas. He took the fire escape to exit the building while the elevator was being used to move their equipment downstairs. After a successful operation, doctors highly recommended that he skip the tour to avoid more severe damage to his foot. Kmak  did perform with the band on January 11th and 12th of 2001 in Chicago however. A bass player named Marty O'Brian was recruited and filled Fuzz's spot until Fuzz was able to play again. On June 4, 2002, Disturbed released a ""documentary"" about the band titled M.O.L., which showed some of the bands more personal moments in the studio and during tours.


Believe
In September 2002, Disturbed released their second studio album titled Believe, which debuted at #1. The songs Prayer, Liberate and Remember all became singles and many fans were impressed with the new album, despite it being less aggressive than their debut. The music video for ""Prayer"" was pulled from most TV stations due to the similarities it had with the September 11, 2001 attacks. Disturbed's front man, David Draiman, recorded the vocals for Forsaken, a track written and produced by Jonathan Davis of the band Korn for the Queen of the Damned soundtrack. In 2003, the band once again participated in the Ozzfest tour and started another one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon II. The bands Chevelle, Taproot, and Unloco toured with them.

In early 2003, after Disturbed had finished the Music as a Weapon II tour, the band experienced the departure of bassist Fuzz, who was excused from the group due to ""personal differences."" He was replaced with Matt Konopinski very briefly, and then John Moyer, who is now the current bass player.


Ten Thousand Fists
Disturbed toured with 10 Years and Ill Niño in support of their third album Ten Thousand Fists, released worldwide on September 20, 2005, which also debuted at #1 in North America. Ten Thousand Fists had five B-side tracks that were not released on the album, but rather on various singles and other albums. Currently the track ""Hell"" can be found on the ""Stricken"" single (a second version of this single has the studio version of the track ""Dehumanized"", which was originally featured as a live track on the Music as a Weapon II live album and DVD). The track can also be heard on the band's MySpace page. The track ""Monster"" was originally released as part of an iTunes pre-order package for the first people who pre-ordered Ten Thousand Fists. Afterwards, the track was very hard to find. But, it can now be found on the ""Tour Edition"" of Ten Thousand Fists (along with the track ""Two Worlds""). The track ""Sickened"" can be found on the ""Land of Confusion"" single. The fifth and final track ""Criminal"" has been released on the band's newest album Indestructible. A month after the release of Ten Thousand Fists, Disturbed headlined the Jägermeister tour along with the band Corrosion of Conformity.

Disturbed supplied the song ""Stricken"" for WWE's New Year's Revolution 2006. In April 2006, the band completed an Australian tour supporting KoRn and sharing the tour with 10 Years and Hatebreed. In mid 2006, a European tour was scheduled but had been moved twice due to David Draiman having troubles with his voice.

In late 2006, Draiman underwent surgery for a deviated septum which affected his voice. It was successful, and ever since then, Draiman has limited his drinking on the road. Disturbed headlined Ozzfest 2006 along with Ozzy Osbourne, System of a Down, Dragon Force, Avenged Sevenfold, Lacuna Coil, and Hatebreed. The band also went on the European tour that had been previously moved twice earlier in 2006. Disturbed headlined another one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon III; the bands Flyleaf, Stone Sour, and Nonpoint toured with them.


Dave Draiman and RIAA
Draiman became involved in the music file sharing controversy by publicly speaking out against the RIAA's lawsuits against filesharing individuals, despite the fact his record label is a member of the RIAA.

""This is not rocket science. Instead of spending all this money litigating against kids who are the people they're trying to sell things to in the first place, they have to learn how to effectively use the Internet. For the artists, my ass...I didn't ask them to protect me, and I don't want their protection."" - Draiman.

Draiman told NYRock:
""I'm Very positive about the internet, Napster. I think it's a tremendous tool for reaching many more people than we ever could without it. When you release music you want it to be heard by people. Artists really want to have their music heard. They want to have their creation heard by people. Nothing is going to do that better than Napster. I can't tell you how many kids have come up to me and said, 'I downloaded a couple of tunes off Napster and I went out and bought the album.' Or they say, 'I want to come see you play.' I don't really make money off of record sales anyway.""


Indestructible to Present (2007 - 2009)
Indestructible was released in the United States on June 3, 2008 and in Australia on June 7, 2008 and became the band's third consecutive number-one debut on the Billboard 200. A special ""Internet Only"" limited edition of the album that includes the B-side track ""Run"", a making-of DVD  with instructional videos, wrap-around poster, VIP laminate, access to special Disturbed events, and a special website with exclusive video, rare audio and more was also released.  The band toured in support of the ""Mayhem Festival"" alongside Slipknot, DragonForce, and Mastodon during summer of 2008.  Disturbed also completed a tour of Australia  and New Zealand through August and September 2008.

The band began their Music as a Weapon IV tour in March 2009 and it ended in late May. The tour, also dubbed a ""festival"", featured the bands Killswitch Engage, Lacuna Coil, and Chimaira on the main stage.


Asylum (2010–2011)

In an earlier interview, David Draiman briefly talked about the band's fifth studio album, stating that the album will be as dark as their previous album, Indestructible, if not darker. Song-writing for the fifth studio album began in late 2009. In an earlier interview with Mike Wengren and John Moyer, it was stated that, judging by Draiman's feelings on the last few years of his life, that Disturbed's new album will be aggressive, angry, and ""hard-hitting"", but will be similar musically to their album Believe. Wengren also said that the new album may be released in the spring or summer of 2010. Additionally, Draiman has confirmed that a DVD is in the works. A countdown clock appeared on the band's website, which ended on January 12, 2010 at 5:00 p.m. EST, and a trailer for the upcoming DVD, titled Decade of Disturbed, was revealed.

In a July 2009 interview with FaceCulture, Draiman stated that the upcoming DVD will be ""chronicling the past decade of Disturbed's existence. It's meant to show our growth over the course of the decade."" He also talked more about the upcoming fifth album: ""A couple of them [song riffs] that Danny has come up with are really amazing. But they're just little pieces...it's not even in two-three part progression [yet].""

A few months later on March 23, 2010, the band released a reissue of their debut album, The Sickness, with the B-side tracks God of the Mind and A Welcome Burden, as well as updated artwork. It will also be available for the first time in vinyl format.

On February 8, 2010, it was announced that the band had entered the studio in Chicago, Illinois to begin recording their fifth album, tentatively set for a summer 2010 release. Guitarist Dan Donegan stated that the band has around 15 to 18 songs for the new album.

On April 20, 2010, roughly two months after they entered the studio, Disturbed announced that they had finished recording the album, and were ready to begin mixing it in Los Angeles, California. As they did with their last album Indestructible, Disturbed stated that they self-produced Asylum. The band announced that Asylum would be released on August 31, 2010. On July 9, 2010, the track listing was revealed on the band's official website. Asylum debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200.


The Lost Children and hiatus (2011–2014)

In July 2011, the band confirmed it would go on hiatus after finishing their US tour that year, and in an interview that same month, Draiman dismissed concerns that the upcoming hiatus was a result of conflict between the band members, saying, ""This is really not due to any animosity. I want to make that very clear. In fact, we just had dinner together last night. Believe me, it's not like we can't work with each other any more or we don't get along. This isn't a bad blood thing, and I don't ever want people to get that impression of it."" Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011.

Disturbed released a b-side compilation album, titled The Lost Children, on November 8, 2011. 

On February 8, 2012, it was announced that John Moyer is Heavy Metal supergroup Adrenaline Mob's new bass player. John made his onstage debut with the group on March 12, at New York City’s Hiro Ballroom, a day before the release of the band's debut full-length album, Omertá. On April 21, 2012, to commemorate Record Store Day, Disturbed released ""The Collection"". It is a box set featuring the band's five full length studio albums in 140 gram vinyl LPs. In May 2012 Draiman announced his new project, an industrial metal band called Device. Draiman has released information regarding the future of Disturbed and his new project Device. He has stated that Device will release their self-titled debut album on April 9, 2013. The album will feature many guest musicians from various metal bands. Donegan, guitarist for Disturbed, also stated to a journalist for MTV that the future for Disturbed was unclear. ""I don't have a clear answer [about the band's future], because I'm not sure where everybody's head's at at the moment other than we're having a great time out on tour, we're going out big, we're carrying big production, we wanna end this on a big note,"" he said. ""I think we're not ready to sit down and have the discussions of when we wanna get back together or if we're gonna. So we're kind of winging it.""

On April 25, 2013, it was announced that guitarist Dan Donegan and drummer Mike Wengren had begun a new project with Evans Blue singer Dan Chandler, Fight or Flight. Their debut album, Life by Design? was released on July 23.

Immortalized (2015-present)

On August 21, 2015, Disturbed released their sixth studio album Immortalized. Bassist John Moyer was not available to record the album, so guitarist Dan Donegan had to perform all the basslines. The album debuted on top of the Billboard 200 and went gold within a year. Immortalized produced three #1 hits on rock radio, ""The Vengeful One"",  ""The Light"", and ""The Sound of Silence"" (a cover of the classic Simon & Garfunkel track. ""The Sound of Silence"" became Disturbed's biggest hit on the Hot 100, peaking at #42 and going platinum.

2) Late 80's Thrash band who released the album Disturbing the Peace in 1988.

""Cool crossover/thrash metal. The music takes off quite a few times, especially when it comes up with contrasting mixtures, like ""Comatose"", which blends heavy doomy riffage with brutal death-tinged outbursts; there are also some undeveloped, but intriguing attempts at more technical thrash (the instrumental ""Brain Deth"", the sophisticated technical ""Productive Intercourse Serial Killer""), spiced with some jolly, rock'n roll hooks. The shorter numbers are pure unbridled hardcore (""Kill 'Em""), but here come the laid-back, soft moments (""Bought & Sold"", ""Die Die Die""), and things are well balanced. ""Evil Sensations"" is a pleasant surprise near the end, being energetic thrash/crossover, with a nice technical twist, followed by the melodic, but interesting instrumental ""Astronomically"", leaving very good impression, partially ruined by the aggressive hardcore closer ""What The Fuck"".  The band disliked the popularity that a novelty song like WTF produced, and it WAS a fan favorite but largely dropped from their live set in the 1990s. Due in part to the lyrics and how the band felt about the song. The band was formed in Minneapolis, MN but toured extensively all over, including the stomping grounds of the later Disturbed; Chicago! They played Jack Koshick's Milwaukee MetalFest in it's earliest days and supported Sepultura and Pestilence on tour, as well as Death and Sadus, and local legends IMPALER. Earl passed away in 2008, he is missed by all who knew him, and his MySpace page remains testament. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Disturbed"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Kungs,"Valentin Brunel (born 17 December 1996), better known by his stage name Kungs, is a French house music DJ, record producer and musician. His collaboration with Cookin' on 3 Burners titled ""This Girl"" reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 2016.

Valentin started his musical career with a djembe gifted by his parents to him at the age of five. Valentin grew up listening to rock and roll classics with his father, including The Who and The Kooks. Discovering a passion for electronic music in his teenage years, Kungs became interested in melodic sounds and crafted timbres led by a dominant vocal. By the age of seventeen he had begun creating melodies using his own instruments. Valentin then began sharing remixes across online social networks.

The Beach Boys,"The Beach Boys are an iconic American rock band, frequently cited as one of the most influential and commercially successful groups of all time. They are recognized for their intricate vocal harmonies, studio innovations, and musical impact that is still felt today. After rising to stardom with a string of hits that defined the '60s California Sound, they delved into progressive pop, experimenting with songs inspired by classical music and the avant-garde. Following their most esteemed work, Pet Sounds (1966), the group became symbols of psychedelic counterculture.

With the release of 1974's Endless Summer they became a more popular touring act, playing their greatest hits. They have recorded 36 Billboard Top 40 hits (including four number-one singles), have had over 100 million sales, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.

Formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961, the original group comprised singer-musician-composer Brian Wilson, his brothers Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friends Al Jardine and David Marks.  South African musicians Blondie Chaplin  and Ricky Fataar played and sang with the band on three key albums during the early 1970s. Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: Brian Wilson's mental illness, drug addiction and eventual withdrawal from the group; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group.

In December 2011, five of the group's surviving members - Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce and David (But not Blondie or Ricky) - reformed in celebration of their 50th anniversary, announcing a new album and a 50-date international tour for 2012. The reunion ended immediately after the tour.

Early Years

The group was formed in 1961 in Hawthorne, California under the leadership of Brian Wilson, and included his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love and school friend Al Jardine.

The early inspirations of the group were the Wilsons' musician father, Murry, and the close vocal harmonies of groups such as The Four Freshmen. The group performed initially as The Pendletones, after the Pendleton woolen shirts popular then. Although surfing motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the sole actual surfer in the group. He suggested to his brothers that they do some songs celebrating his hobby and the lifestyle which had developed around it in Southern California.

At first Murry Wilson, by many accounts a hard-driving man, steered The Beach Boys' career, engineering their signing with Capitol Records in 1962. In 1964 Brian Wilson fired his father after a violent confrontation in the studio. Over the next few years they became increasingly estranged; when Murry died some years later, Brian and Dennis did not attend the funeral.

The Beach Boys' early material focused on the California youth lifestyle (e.g., ""All Summer Long"", ""Fun, Fun, Fun""), cars (""Little Deuce Coupe"") and of course surfing (""Surfin' U.S.A."", ""Surfin' Safari"" and many others). Although their music was bright and accessible, these early works contained remarkably sophisticated musical ideas. During this period, Brian Wilson rapidly progressed to become a melodist, arranger, and producer of world-renowned stature. Their early hits made them major pop stars in America and other countries, although their status as America's top pop group was challenged in 1964 by the emergence of The Beatles, who became The Beach Boys' major creative rival.

Like The Beatles, the Beach Boys showed very fast development during the mid-'60s, drawing upon the innovations of songwriters and producers such as Burt Bacharach and especially Phil Spector. They produced the enduring classic ""California Girls"" in 1965, a banner year for popular music which also saw similarly advanced singles by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Byrds, and James Brown. But it was the Beach Boys' role to create a myth of American freedom and dreams of adolescence, and increasingly, to articulate a dread of what lay after adolescence.

Brian's innovations and personal difficulties

During 1964, Brian Wilson began to suffer from anxiety attacks, and withdrew from touring to concentrate on song writing and record production. Glen Campbell served as Wilson's replacement on tours, until his own career success required him to leave the group. Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston subsequently became a full-time member of the band, first replacing Wilson on the road, and then contributing his talents in the studio.

Wilson's growing mastery of the recording studio and his increasingly sophisticated songs and complex arrangements reached an early peak with the acclaimed LP Pet Sounds (1966). Classic singles from that album, ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and ""God Only Knows"" showed Wilson's growing skill as a composer, arranger and producer. ""God Only Knows"" is said to have been the first pop single ever released in the U.S. to have the word ""God"" in the title (because of which many radio stations in the U.S. refused to play it.) ""Caroline, No"" also taken from Pet Sounds, was issued as a Brian Wilson solo single, the only time Brian was credited as a solo artist during the early Capitol years.

The album's meticulously layered harmonies and inventive instrumentation (performed by the cream of Los Angeles session musicians known as The Wrecking Crew) set a new standard for popular music. It remains one of the more evocative releases of the decade, with a distinctive strain of melancholy and nostalgia for youth. The album is still widely regarded as a classic and Paul McCartney has named it one of his favorite albums of all time, (with ""God Only Knows"" as his favorite song) often saying that it was a major influence on The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Despite the critical praise it received, the album was poorly promoted by Capitol Records and failed to become the major hit Brian had hoped it would be (only reaching #10). Its failure to gain wide recognition hurt him deeply.

Because of his withdrawal from touring, Wilson was able to complete almost all the backing for the album while the Beach Boys were on tour in Japan. They returned to find a substantially complete album, requiring only their vocals to finish it off. There was some resistance from within the band to this new direction. Lead singer Mike Love is reported to have been strongly opposed to it, partly because he feared the band would lose its audience if they changed their successful formula, and partly because he personally disliked the new material, which he famously criticized as ""Brian's ego music."" At Love's insistence, Brian changed the title of one song from ""Hang on to Your Ego"" to ""I Know There's an Answer"". Another likely factor in Love's antipathy to Pet Sounds was that Wilson worked extensively on it with outside lyricist Tony Asher rather than with Love, even though Love had co-written the lyrics for many of their earlier songs and was the lead vocalist on most of their early hits. It should also be stated that Love, as recently as February 2008 in a top British music magazine, denies emphatically that he was opposed to Brian's new directions. Quite the contrary, contributing the lyrics to the classic form of ""Good Vibrations,"" which certainly seemed to usher in flower power. He really is tired of this view of him as being Brian's nemesis. He could see Brian was destroying himself and that was what he feared.

Seeking to expand on the advances made on Pet Sounds, Wilson began an even more ambitious project, originally dubbed Dumb Angel. Its first fruit was ""Good Vibrations,"" which Brian described as ""a pocket symphony"". The song became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date, and a US and UK # 1 single in 1966 — many critics consider it to be one of the best rock singles of all time. In 1997 it was named the ""Greatest Single of All Time"" by Mojo music magazine, in 2000, VH1 placed it at number 8 on their ""100 Greatest Rock Songs"" list, and in late 2004 Rolling Stone magazine placed it at number 6 on their ""500 Best Songs of All Time"" list. It was also one of the more complex pop productions ever undertaken, and was reputed to have been the most expensive American single ever recorded, costing a reported $16,000 -- more than most pop albums of that time -- with sessions stretching over several months in at least three major studios.

In contrast to his work on Pet Sounds, Wilson adopted a modular approach to ""Good Vibrations"" — he broke the song into sections and taped multiple versions of each at different studios to take advantage of the different sound of each facility. He then assembled his favorite sections into a master backing track and added vocals. The song's innovative instrumentation included drums, organ, piano, tack piano, two basses, guitars, electro-theremin, harmonica, and cello. The group members recall the ""Good Vibrations"" vocal sessions as among the most demanding of their career.

Even as his personal life deteriorated, Wilson's musical output remained remarkable. The exact nature of his problems was a topic of much speculation. He abused drugs heavily, gained an enormous amount of weight, suffered long bouts of depression, and became paranoid. Several biographies have suggested that his father may have had bipolar disorder, and after years of suffering, Wilson's own condition was eventually diagnosed as schizophrenia.

The story behind ""Smile""

Shortly after completing ""Good Vibrations,"" Wilson met session musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks, and in late 1966 they began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of superb new songs for the Beach Boys' next album, which was originally going to be titled Dumb Angel but was renamed Smile. Using the same methods as on ""Good Vibrations,"" recording began in late 1966 and carried on into early 1967. Although the structure of the album and the exact running order of the songs have been subjects of endless speculation, it is apparent that Wilson and Parks intended Smile to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated the musical themes of the major songs.

But some of the other Beach Boys — especially Love — found the new music too difficult and too far removed from their established style; another serious concern was that the new music was simply not feasible for live performance by the current Beach Boys lineup. Love was bitterly opposed to Smile and was particularly critical of Parks' lyrics; he has also since stated that he was becoming deeply concerned about Wilson's escalating drug intake. The problems came to a head during the recording of ""Cabinessence,"" when Love demanded that Parks explain the meaning of the closing refrain of the song, ""Over and over the crow cries uncover the cornfield."" After a heated argument, Parks walked out and his partnership with Wilson came to an abrupt end.

Many factors combined to focus intense pressure on Wilson as Smile neared completion, including mental instability, the pressure to perform against fierce opposition to his new music, the relatively poor response to Pet Sounds, Carl Wilson's draft resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol. Matters were complicated by his reliance on both prescription and illegal drugs, particularly marijuana and amphetamines, which only exacerbated his underlying mental health problems.

Just weeks before The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was released, Smile was shelved. Over the next 30 years the legends surrounding Smile grew, until it became the most famous unreleased album in the history of popular music. Some of the tracks were salvaged and rerecorded at Brian's new home studio in drastically scaled-down versions. These were released, along with the completed versions of ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Heroes and Villains"", on the 1967 LP Smiley Smile, which would prove to be a critical and commercial disaster for the group.

Despite the cancellation of Smile, interest in the work remained high and versions of several major tracks — including ""Our Prayer"", ""Cabinessence"", ""Cool, Cool Water"", and ""Surf's Up"" — were assembled by Carl Wilson over the next few years and included on later albums. The band was expecting to complete and release Smile even until 1972, when it became clear that only Brian would ever be able to make sense out of the endless fragments that were recorded. A substantial number of original tracks and linking fragments were included on the group's 30th anniversary CD boxed set in 1993. Smile itself, in its original conception, did not surface until Wilson and Parks completed the writing and Brian rerecorded it as a solo project in 2004.

Mid-career brings changes

Following their peak popularity with the song ""Good Vibrations"" was a period of declining commercial success, with Smiley Smile and subsequent albums doing poorly on the US charts (although they fared better in the UK). Their image problems were not helped by the criticism that followed their withdrawal from the bill of the 1967 Monterey International Pop Festival as a result of Carl's draft problems, an event that would undoubtedly have been crucial in establishing their new sound had they been able to present their new material there.

The 1967 album Wild Honey, regarded by many critics as a classic, features exuberant upbeat songs written by Brian and Mike, including the hit ""Darlin'"", and a cover of Stevie Wonder's ""I Was Made to Love Her"". Friends (1968) is a quiet, tuneful, and largely acoustic album, influenced by the group's adoption of the practice of transcendental meditation. The title single, however, backed by Dennis' songwriting debut Little Bird, was their least successful since 1962. This was followed by the single ""Do It Again"", a return to their earlier ""fun in the sun"" style, which was moderately successful in the US, but went to #1 in the UK.

As Brian's health deteriorated in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his song output diminished and he became increasingly withdrawn from the group. To fill the void, the other members of the group began writing songs, and Carl gradually took over leadership of the band, developing into an accomplished producer. To complete their contract with Capitol Records before signing with Reprise, they produced one more album, 20/20 (1969), primarily a collection of leftovers (including some from Smile), cover songs, and several new songs by Dennis. One of Denny's songs, ""Never Learn Not To Love"", featured lyrics by Charles Manson originally titled ""Cease to Exist"". Besides ""Do It Again"", the album included their cover of The Ronettes' ""I Can Hear Music"", their last top 40 hit for seven years.

Their first two Reprise LPs were Sunflower (1970) and 1971's Surf's Up, featuring new songs by Brian and all the group members, plus selections from the aborted Smile project. According to the liner notes for the 2004 version of Smile, Reprise expected the legendary album to be completed and released as part of the new contract, but this was never to be; however, these albums included some of their most evolved and complex music since the Smile period.

The addition of Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin in 1972 led to a dramatic departure in sound for the band. Carl and The Passions - So Tough was an uncharacteristic mix including several songs unrecognizable as the Beach Boys. Although it includes the classic ""Marcella"", many consider the album among their poorest efforts. Continuing with Fataar and Chaplin, Holland (1973) was more successful. The album's lead single ""Sail on Sailor,"" a brief return to the collaboration between Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, was one of the more emblematic of Beach Boys songs. Although it did not produce any top-40 hits, Holland was popular on free-form FM-radio, and includes several classics including Al Jardine's ""California Saga/California"".

In the summer of 1974 Capitol, in consultation with Love, released a double album compilation of the Beach Boys' pre-Pet Sounds hits, entitled Endless Summer. Helped by a sunny, colorful graphic cover, it caught the mood of the country and surged to #1 on the Billboard album chart, becoming their first gold record since ""Good Vibrations"", and stayed on the album chart for three years. The following year another compilation, Spirit of America, also did well. These sales performances demonstrated that the classic Beach Boys sound was back in fashion.

In 1975, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit ""Wishing You Were Here"". Beach Boy voices were also heard on Elton John's 1974 hit ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"", but following Holland, the group produced no new music until 1976.

Brian's return

15 Big Ones marked the return of Brian Wilson as a major force in the group. This album includes several new songs composed by Brian, and several of his arrangements of favorite old songs by other artists, including ""Rock and Roll Music"" (which made #5), ""Blueberry Hill"", and ""In The Still of The Night"". Brian and Mike's ""It's OK"" was a return to their earlier ""fun-in-the-sun"" style, and was a moderate hit.

In 1977 the Beach Boys released the LP Love You, a collection of 14 songs mostly written by Brian alone, including more ""fun"" songs (""Honkin' Down The Highway""), a mature love song (""Let's Put Our Hearts Together"") - a quirky mix ranging from infectious to touching to downright silly. Although not a commercial success, the album has since gained the status of a classic within the Beach Boys' oeuvre.

Brian's contributions diminished over the next several albums until he again virtually withdrew from the group. Although he appeared sporadically with them in concert, he contributed little to their performances or recordings. Despite a much-publicised ""Brian's Back"" campaign in the late '70s, most critics believed the group was past their prime. Many expected that Brian would one day become the latest in a long line of celebrity drug casualties.

Deaths of Dennis and Carl Wilson

In the late 70s Dennis Wilson also began to suffer increasingly from drug and alcohol abuse, and some of the group's concert appearances were marred when he and other band members showed up onstage drunk or drugged. The band was forced to publicly apologize after a shambolic performance in Sydney in 1979 during which several members of the group appeared to be drunk. In spite of his own frequent drinking, Dennis Wilson managed to release his first solo work, Pacific Ocean Blue, and to launch the now famed work-in-progress Bambu, with friend and musician Carli Muñoz.

In 1980, the Beach Boys played a Fourth of July concert on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. before a vast crowd. This tradition continued for the next two years, but in 1983 Secretary of the Interior James Watt banned the group from playing on the Mall, saying that rock concerts drew ""an undesirable element"". This drew howls of outrage from the many of the Beach Boys' American fans, who stated that the Beach Boys sound was a very desirable part of the American cultural fabric. First Lady Nancy Reagan apologized, and in 1985 the group appeared on the Mall again. The group most recently appeared on the Mall in 2005 for the Fourth of July concert.

Dennis Wilson's problems had escalated in the early 1980s, and he accidentally drowned in late 1983 while diving from his boat as he drunkenly tried to recover items he had previously thrown overboard. Despite Dennis's death, The Beach Boys soldiered on, and they enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as the David Lee Roth version of ""California Girls"". In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, covering the song ""Wipe Out"" and filming a video for it. They scored their first #1 in 22 years with the 1988 song ""Kokomo,"" which was featured on the soundtrack of the hit Tom Cruise movie Cocktail and which became their biggest-selling hit ever. In 1996 they guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of Fun, Fun, Fun, which was a British Top 30 hit.

Members of the band appeared on sitcoms such as Full House (starring sometimes drummer John Stamos) and Home Improvement in the 1990s, as well as touring occasionally, but their declining career contrasted dramatically with the massive public interest and rabid critical praise that followed Brian's gradual return to touring in the 1990s. The critically acclaimed documentary I Just Wasn't Made For These Times, important in restoring Wilson's reputation, saw him performing for the first time with his now adult daughters, Wendy and Carnie, and included glowing tributes to his talents from a host of major music stars of the '60s, '70s, and '80s.

Tragedy struck the Wilson family again in 1998 when Carl Wilson died of lung cancer. In 1997, while Carl was in the hospital fighting his cancer, David Marks rejoined the group, subbing for Carl. After Carl's death, Al Jardine was forced out of the group due to a conflict with Love. Brian Wilson was pursuing a solo career at the time, and had no desire to work with the Beach Boys. Permission was given to Mike Love to tour under the Beach Boys' name, and from 1998 to 2011, ""The Beach Boys"" consisted of Mike Love and Bruce Johnston. Marks toured with them from Carl's death until the summer of 1999, when he left the group due to health reasons. Their tours remained popular, even as they came to be viewed primarily as a nostalgia act. Meanwhile, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine each separately pursued solo careers with their new bands.

Personnel changes through the years

From the start, The Beach Boys have undergone many variations in composition, being represented by fill-ins as often as not. Wilson neighbor David Marks appeared on their first four albums and was a member from 1962 to 1963 as a temporary replacement for Jardine, who had left the group to pursue a career in dentistry. Marks rejoined the band in 1997, during Carl Wilson's last illness, and remained with them for two years.

Glen Campbell toured for several months with the group in 1965, as a touring replacement for Brian, who had played bass in concert. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Bruce Johnston, who later became a permanent member. During the mid-1970s drummer Ricky Fataar and guitarist Blondie Chaplin joined the band.

Though not official members, The Beach Boys' supporting band has featured many notable musicians over the years. Keyboard player Daryl Dragon, later famous as half of the pop duo Captain & Tennille, toured with the band, along with his future wife Toni Tennille. Carli Muñoz, who had been playing percussion with the band since 1970, in 1971 replaced Daryl Dragon as keyboard player until 1981. Jeff Foskett joined the touring band in 1981 as a guitarist and vocalist and remained with the group until 1990, Foskett is currently a member of Brian Wilson's group. Billy Hinsche, of Dino, Desi, & Billy fame, was also a longtime member of the supporting band throughout the '70s, '80s, and '90s. Daryl Dragon's brother Dennis Dragon was a percussionist for the group in the early '70s. Bobby Figueroa was a drummer and percussionist for the Beach Boys in the 1970s and 80s. Mike Meros was a longtime keyboard player for the group, leaving in 2001 to join Alan Jardine's Endless Summer Band (Meros passed away in late 2007). Mike Kowalski was a longtime drummer for the band, starting his Beach Boys tenure in 1969, and continuing with the group throughout the '70s, '80s,' 90s, and '00s, only to leave in 2007. Ed Carter played guitar and bass for the group from 1969 through the late 1990s. Carter joined Al Jardine's Beach Boys Friends and Family in 1999.

Some of the changes in The Beach Boys' organization were less formal. They enjoyed a casual collaboration with fellow Southern Californians Jan and Dean. Much to the consternation of other band members, Wilson composed ""Surf City"" and gave the song, without compensation, to Dean Torrence. Jan and Dean, at the time not nearly as popular as The Beach Boys, recorded the song and scored their first number one single, long before the Beach Boys reached the same milestone. Years later, Torrence happened upon the studio where the Beach Boys were recording their ""Beach Boys' Party!"" album. He joined in the singing, and can be heard singing harmony in the ""Barbara Ann"" cut from that album.

After the death of Carl Wilson, Mike Love received permission from Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, and the estate of Carl Wilson to tour under the Beach Boys name. In 1998 and 1999, Mike Love, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks toured under this incarnation of the Beach Boys. In 1999, David Marks left so he could focus on fighting his Hepatitis C (He was fully cured in 2004.). From 1999 to 2011, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston have played up to 100 shows a year, sometimes more, under the Beach Boys banner.

Jardine toured for a while with the Beach Boys Family & Friends (which for legal reasons quickly became Alan Jardine Family & Friends Beach Band), featuring his sons Matt and Adam, Wilson's daughters Carnie and Wendy, former Beach Boys sidemen Ed Carter , Bobby Figueroa, and Carl's brother-in-law Billy Hinsche, among others. Jardine now tours as the Endless Summer Band which includes his two sons, Hinsche, and several other performers including members of the pop/rock band Tripsitter.

50th Anniversary

In December 2011, surviving members Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks, and Bruce Johnston reunited for a new studio album and an extensive 70-plus date ""50th Anniversary Celebration"" world tour. They used musicians from both Brian Wilson's solo band and Mike Love's touring ""Beach Boys"" as sidemen. The reunited Beach Boys played to enthusiastic crowds all over the world. 

In 2012 Mike Love announced that he and Bruce Johnston had booked shows for their scaled down version of the Beach Boys. Wilson, Jardine, and Marks wanted to continue with the reunited line up, but for various reasons, Love did not. 

In 2013, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston are continuing to tour under the Beach Boys name. Brian Wilson has been in the studio, it is not known whether the sessions are for the Beach Boys, or for Brian solo material. Brian Wilson also plans to play two shows with Al Jardine and David Marks, one show in Ohio, and the other at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. A live album and/or DVD, and a career-spanning box set entitled ""Made In California"" was released in 2013.

------------------------------
The brainchild of 26-year-old Brighton born singer/songwriter Mike Rosenberg, Passenger is redefining the troubadour for the 21st century. Formerly a five-piece band, Passenger has now pared back to basics, quite literally bringing music to the streets on a series of lengthy busking journeys across Australia, America and the United Kingdom. A classic journeyman musician, cut from the same mould as Van Morrison, Neil Young and John Prine, Passenger has the unique ability to move from the humorous to heartbreaking with every song.

After a year spent crisscrossing the UK and US with his debut album Wicked Man’s Rest, Passenger’s markedly stripped down and soulful second album Wide Eyes Blind Love was brought to the public as it was created: on the road. Setting up on street corners across the UK and Australia, Passenger halted passers by in their hundreds; all connecting to the mellifluous tones and powerfully hewn lyrics emanating from this lone figure and his guitar. This is music as Passenger means it to be, unvarnished and honest, just pure talent and powerful tunes that tap straight into the heart of the crowd.

Struck by the dynamic freedom of the troubadour life, Passenger developed the grass roots method of Wide Eyes Blind Love into the germ of a new album. Impressively and entirely self funded through busking income, Passenger set about recording a series of collaborations with musical friends met along the way. Flight Of The Crow is the remarkable result of Passenger’s intrepid journey, with Australian artists Lior, Josh Pyke, Katie Noonan, Boy & Bear, Kate Miller Heidke, Philadelphia Grand Jury, Brian Campeau and Elana Stone, Matt Corby, Jess Chalker and Dead Letter Chorus all lending their voices to this serendipitous creative venture. Flight Of The Crow was recorded in Sydney’s famous BJB studios over February and March of 2010, and co-produced by Berkfinger (AKA Simon Berkleman from Philadelphia Grand Jury).

As a second album born of the road, Flight Of The Crow speaks to the compelling quality of Passenger’s music and the striking sincerity of his lyrics, both of which are matched by his dedication to this grass roots style of craftsmanship and collaboration. How utterly remarkable that a lone musician can travel the globe, and literally from the street, connect with some of Australia’s finest musical talents to produce a self-funded album. This is the stuff of legend, with Passenger clearly evoking the humble, hardworking creativity of the troubadours of old.

Passenger was formed in 1995 by Sten and Engelin. Both members wanted to do something that was not Thrash metal or Melodic death metal unlike the bands they played in. At its early stages the band was originally called ""Cliff"". Under the name Cliff they recorded two demos in Studio Fredman that were never released. After a break in the band and after Engelin was hired as a session guitarist for In Flames' Whoracle tour, Anders Fridén, the vocalist of In Flames showed interest in Passenger and joined the band.

In the year 2000 the band came back from its break and went on to record a demo. In 2001 the band recorded another demo in which early versions of the songs ""Used"", ""In My Head"", ""Circus"" and ""Drowning City"" were recorded. After a third demo the band finally recorded and released their debut album entitled Passenger. A video for ""In Reverse"" was also released.

Sten noted in February 2004 on their official website that they were in the process of recording their second album. However, since then, Fridén, lead vocalist of both Passenger and In Flames has been noted saying that he has very little time for the project, due to other commitments, and the group is currently on hold. In an interview with Fridén he stated that as soon as he gets a break from In Flames, he wants to get all the group together to record a second album for early 2010. This did however not happen as Anders continued touring with In Flames until October 2010 when they entered their studio to record their next album.

Passenger or PSNGR is an active hardcore/screamo band formed in San José, Costa Rica born in 2004. Their EP ""Get OFF the Rails!"" (tentative title) will be out in 20/01/09. Band members: Alejandro Pacheco (vocals & guitar), Grego Rojas (guitar), Andres Moraga (bass), Jose Vargas (drums). www.myspace.com/passenger
------------------------------

Passenger the acoustic rock band was formed in late 2000. They have a large archive of both original music and cover songs. They released their first pressed album, entitled ""Four Letter Word"", in September 2004 on indie label Crop Circle Records.

------------------------------

Passenger is an Austin, Texas based MC. Born in Massachusetts, he spent most of his younger days growing up in New York and Houston, Tx eventually moving to Austin, Tx in 1996 attending college to try his hand as a sound engineer. During these years, his musical versatility had him playing bass in an alternative rock band, singing in another side project, DJing house, jungle and hip hop music at various venues in Austin. Eventually he became a full time DJ for the reggae/ska/hiphop/punk band, Indofin, which he was a member for years touring the country. His love for hip hop provoked him to purchase an MPC and has been making beats and rhyming ever since. ""The Brick In A Glass House"", his debut album, contains production from Nozebleed, Lazerbeak (Doomtree), amongst others as well as his own and has guests from Austin's own Emcee, Justin Cook, Weezel, as well as a few others. Currently, you can find him playing shows around the Austin area and will begin to venturing out to other Texas cities. He is also working on putting together a live band to back him at shows and working on new material.

------------------------------

Passenger is also an old alias of DJ Tiësto. Tiësto only produced 2 tracks under his old Passenger-alias: ""Blackspin"" and ""F.A.H."", both appearing on a record released on Momentum Records in 1996.

------------------------------

Passenger began winter of 2002 when guitarist dustin covert and bassist/vocalist david mata collaborated on the bands first full length ""alive"" an 8 song full length about a disoriented and dark but intriguing view of love and romance. the album explored dissonant melodies and agonizingly slow chord progressions with the use of mark sampson on drums and sam billen on piano. in 2003 passenger progressed to a four person line up with michael oberlin on drums and james demis on keyboards and sound and began to play various rock venues in chicago, illinois and used silent film to accompany their live performance. numerous line-up changes took effect during the next year and a half, but in 2005 the concrete line-up of Dustin Covert and David D'Antonio on guitars, David Mata on Bass and Samuel Vincent on drums was achieved. In winter of 2005 Passenger recorded ""The Owls are Restless"", a 2 hour and 40 minute concept record about an ancient war between owls and rabbits and was recorded and engineered by Steve Whitney in a warehouse in Aurora, Illinois. Shortly after the recording drummer Samuel Vincent tragically passed away. Without his talent and with the grief of losing a dear, dear friend the band decided it was impossible to continue performing the material or anything that involved Passenger. These unfortunate events occurred before ""The Owls are Restless"" was able to achieve any sort of record label attention, and when it finally did it was too late. The remaining musicians have continued creating in their band White Devil, named after the vintage moog synth/organ that Sam would play in collaboration with his drums in Passenger.

Iron Maiden,"There are multiple artists with this name:

1) Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, east London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. The band's discography has grown to thirty-seven albums, including fifteen studio albums, eleven live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations.

Pioneers of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums, including 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live After Death , 1986's Somewhere in Time and 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their latest studio offering, The Final Frontier, peaking at No. 1 in 28 different countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim.

Despite little radio or television support, Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history, with The New York Times reporting in 2010 that they have sold over 85 million records worldwide. The band won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002. As of October 2013, the band have played over 2000 live shows throughout their career. For the past 35 years, the band have been supported by their famous mascot, ""Eddie"", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows.

The band has changed their line-up several times up to 1999 when Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith  returned to the band. 

Their current line-up is:

Steve Harris (1975-): bass, backing vocals, studio keyboards
David Michael Murray (1975-): guitar
Paul Bruce Dickinson (1981-1993 1999-): lead vocals (see also Bruce Dickinson, Samson)
Nicko McBrain (1983-): drums, percussion (see also Trust)
Janick Gers (1990-): guitar (see also Bruce Dickinson, White Spirit)
Adrian Smith (1980-1990, 1999-): guitar, backing vocals (see also Bruce Dickinson and Psycho Motel).

Former members:

Doug Sampson – drums, percussion (1977–1979)
Dennis Stratton – guitars, backing vocals (1979–1980)
Paul Di'Anno – lead vocals (1978–1981)
Clive Burr – drums, percussion (1979–1982)
Blaze Bayley – lead vocals (1994–1998)
Dennis Wilcock - lead vocals (1976–1977)
Barry Purkis – drums, percussion (1977)
Paul Day - lead vocals (1975–1976).

Iron Maiden's work has inspired other sub-genres of heavy metal, including power metal and speed metal, and is generally thought of as an influence to any ""metal"" music containing dual-guitar harmonization. One example of their far reaching influence is that many bands from virtually every rock and metal sub-genre list Iron Maiden as one of their influences.

Many of the band's songs are based on history, folklore, movies and books, such as Aces High, Brave New World, The Trooper, The Clansman, The Wicker Man, The Prisoner, Where Eagles Dare, Out of the Silent Planet, To Tame a Land(based on Frank Herbert's Dune) and Rime of the Ancient Mariner – in which words from the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem are incorporated into the song.

2) Iron Maiden (later aka The Bolton Iron Maiden) is a late sixties doom-band. This Iron Maiden was formed in 1964 by Barry Skeels, Steve Drewett, Chris Rose and Alan Hooker as an acoustic band in Basildon, Essex that eventually evolved into a band called Iron Maiden. By 1966, the lineup was Skeels (bass), Drewett (vocals/harmonies), Rose (lead guitar), Tom Loates (rhythm guitar) and Stan Gillem (drums); they played Rolling Stones and blues numbers under the name ""Growth"". Reduced to a two-piece, Drewett and Skeels played blues under the name of ""Stevenson's Blues Department"" in pubs and clubs in Essex and London. They supported a number of up and coming bands including Jethro Tull, Fleetwood Mac, The Groundhogs and King Crimson.

In 1968, Drewett and Skeels were joined by Paul Reynolds (drums) and Trevor Thoms (guitar). They released an acetate (God of Darkness/Ballad of Martha Kent) under the then risqué name of BUM. When they signed to the Gemini label in 1970, the name was changed to the less risqué Iron Maiden. They recorded their debut album Maiden Voyage. Reynolds was replaced by Steve Chapman on drums and Iron Maiden released the single Ned Kelly/Falling. This coincided with Mick Jagger's film ""Ned Kelly"". A planned Australian tour fell through. The Gemini record label also folded (with the loss of the debut album master tapes) and Skeels left Iron Maiden. The band carried on without him for a while, but the debut album was not released until 1998 using duplicate tapes owned by Skeels. This ""original"" Iron Maiden is often considered by fans as one of the earliest 'true' doom metal bands.

However, soon after the ""original"" Iron Maiden was re-discovered , their name was officially changed to 'The Bolton Iron Maiden' since the Iron Maiden led by Steve Harris already had the name 'Iron Maiden' trademarked. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Jay-Z,"Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969 in Brooklyn, New York, United States), is an American rapper and former president and CEO of Roc A Fella Records. He is more commonly known by a variety of stage names including Jay-Z, S. Carter, Jigga, Hova, J-Hova, Hov, and Young Hov. He is regarded as one of the most prolific and successful American blend artists of the mid-90s and early 2000s and is known for his use of metaphors, freestyling abilities, word play, flow, and blending of street and popular hip hop. He is one of the most respected rappers in the music industry, and is admired for his ability to craft songs from  memory without the use of pen and paper. He married his long time girlfriend Beyonce in April 2008 after dating for over seven years. He is one of the founders of Roc-A-Fella Records, a hip-hop record label which also launched the careers of artists such as Beanie Sigel, Kanye West, Memphis Bleek, Young Gunz, Freeway, and Teairra Mari.

Early history
Originally from the infamous Marcy Houses projects in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn in New York City, Shawn Carter was abandoned by his father Adnes Reeves when he was only twelve years old and he was consequently raised by his mother Gloria Carter. Jay-Z attended George Westinghouse High School in Downtown Brooklyn and Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey but did not graduate. He claims to have been caught up in selling drugs on the streets of New York in the Marcy Projects. In addition to this, Jay-Z has lyrically alluded to having sold crack cocaine and marijuana in Virginia and Maryland.

According to his mother, a young Jay-Z used to keep his siblings up at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. Eventually, she bought him a boombox for his birthday and thus sparked his interest in music. He began freestyling, writing rhymes, and followed the music of many artists popular at the time.

In his neighborhood, Carter was known as ""Jazzy,"" a nickname which eventually developed into his stage name, ""Jay-Z."" The moniker is also a homage to his musical partner Lee Dub (www.soundclick.com/kingdeezy) Jaz-O (a.k.a. the Jaz, Big Jaz) as well as to the J-Z subway lines that have a stop at Marcy Avenue in Brooklyn.

Jay-Z can be heard on several of The Jaz's early recordings, including 1988's ""The Originators"" and ""Hawaiian Sophie"", he also collaborated with Inglewood, California producer Three-1-Zero which began his popularity as an artist. His career had a jump start when he battled a rapper by the name of Zai. The battle caught the eye of many record labels, as Jay-Z was able to hold his own against Zai. He also made an appearance on a popular song by Big L, ""Da Graveyard.""

Commercial work

From the beginning of his commercial recording career, Jay-Z chose a route that many would consider untraditional. Rather than waiting to get signed to a major label, Jay-Z created Roc-A-Fella Records as his own independent label. After striking a deal with Priority to distribute his material, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Clark Kent and a notable appearance by The Notorious B.I.G.. Although the album received critical acclaim, record sales were poor and were a disappointment.

After reaching a new distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Executive produced by Diddy, it sold better than his previous effort even though Jay later explained that this was one of the worst periods of his life. He was reeling from the death of his close friend Biggie. Due to the glossy production on his sophomore album, many of the fans he'd earned previously now claimed he was selling out and catering to a more commercial audience. However, the album did feature some beats from producers who had worked with him on Reasonable Doubt, namely DJ Premier and Ski.

1998's Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, ""Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)."" Critics would still accuse him of becoming even more commercial and egotistical, due to the lack of intellectual matter on this album. He also relied more heavily on flow, developing it further, and he continued his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz and Timbaland. Charting hits from this album included ""Can I Get A..."" featuring Ja Rule and ""Jigga What, Jigga Who."". Vol. 2 would eventually become Jay-Z's most commercially successful album, certifying platinum five times in the United States.

In 1999 Jay-Z released Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. Despite continued criticism for his increasingly pop-oriented sound and a large number of collaborations that many felt crowded out Jay-Z himself, the album proved to be successful and went platinum three times. Through his lyricism, he was able to retain respect from some of his die-hard fans. Vol. 3 is remembered for its smash hit, ""Big Pimpin"" (feat UGK) and the negative remarks to then-underground New York rapper known as 50 Cent.

By this time, Jay-Z was seen as a hip-hop figurehead both by hardcore fans and by the corporations of rap due to his lyrics and his high album sales, achieving a pinnacle rarely held in rap music. The subject of much criticism, praise, popularity, condemnation, and discussion, Jay decided to begin developing other artists besides himself. Around 2000, he and Damon Dash signed various artists (including Beanie Sigel and Freeway) and began introducing them to the public. He next appeared on The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which was intended as a compilation album to introduce these new artists, though the album had Jay-Z's name on it to strengthen sales and acclaim.

2001's The Blueprint is considered by many to be one of hip hop's ""classic"" albums, receiving the coveted ""5 mic"" review from The Source magazine. Released on September 11, 2001, the album managed to debut at #1, selling more than 450,000 albums in its first week.

The Blueprint was applauded for its production and the balance of ""mainstream"" and ""hardcore"" rap, receiving recognition from both audiences. Eminem was the only guest artist on the album, producing and rapping on the single ""Renegade"" (to which rival Nas would rap, ""Eminem murdered you on your own shit"" on ""Ether."") The Blueprint also includes the popular ""Izzo (H.O.V.A.)"" and ""Takeover"", a song which takes rivals Prodigy of Mobb Deep and Nas. A large portion of the material on this album was produced by Kanye West and represents one of West's first major breaks in the industry.

A feud between Jay-Z and Nas culminated in ""Takeover"", a diss from Jay-Z to Nas, in the fall of 2001. Many fans praised the diss as an effective method to shut down Nas's career for good. Nas responded with the diss track ""Ether"". He shocked fans by creating arguably an even more lethal track than Takeover, and had regained his respect. Over the course of the feud, Jay-Z claims that he and Allen Iverson slept with Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas' daughter, Destiny. Nas, in turn, accused Jay of brown nosing other artists for fame, and then leaving them for dead once he was famous. This feud proved to be a huge draw in the world of hip-hop. The feud died down over 2002 and was finally resolved in October 2005.

Jay-Z's next solo album was 2002's The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse a sprawling double-album which was touted by fans as having too much 'filler' or unnecessary material. It was later reissued in a single-disc version, The Blueprint 2.1, which retained half of the tracks from the original. The album spawned two hit singles ""Excuse Me Miss"" and ""03 Bonnie and Clyde"" featuring Beyoncé Knowles.

In 2003, Jay-Z toured with 50 Cent, Busta Rhymes and Sean Paul while finishing work on what was announced as his final album, The Black Album. Notable songs on the album included ""What More Can I Say,"" ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder,"" ""Change Clothes,"" and ""99 Problems."" That song was a cross-over hit comparable to The Beastie Boys' ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" which some believe pays homage to the now-rare old-school rap style. A few of the songs done on this album portray a more personal side of Jay-Z; for example, ""Moment of Clarity"" sheds light on his feelings towards his estranged father and coping with his death. It also deals with accusations that he sold out to reach a wider audience. ""What More Can I Say"" addresses the ""biting"" accusations with which many critics have impugned him.

In 2004, there was a runaway hit remix project by DJ Danger Mouse called The Grey Album in which Jay-Z's Black Album vocals were blended with instrumentals sampled exclusively from The Beatles' White Album (which subsequently embroiled the DJ in a lawsuit that was later dropped with EMI, the owner's to the Beatles' work). This was made possible by an a cappella version of the ""Black Album"" that Jay-Z released with the specific intent for others to mix. The success of ""The Grey Album"" led to a rainbow of Black Album remix projects including ""The Red Album"", ""The Blue Album"" and so forth.

Also in 2004, Jay-Z collaberated with the triple platinum selling band, Linkin Park. The project was named Collision Course, and contained a six track EP, as well as a making of DVD. Some of the mash ups tracks were entitled Dirt Off Your Shoulder/Lying From You, Jigga What/Faint, and Numb/Encore.

Jay-Z returned with his comeback album on November 21, 2006 titled Kingdom Come. Jay-Z's comeback single, ""Show Me What You Got"", was leaked on the Internet in early October 2006, scheduled to be released later on that month, received heavy air-play after its leak, causing the FBI to step in and investigate. Jay-Z worked with video director Hype Williams, and the single's video was directed by F. Gary Gray. The album features producers such as Just Blaze, Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, Dr. Dre and Coldplay's Chris Martin. This album has sold more than 2 million copies in the U.S. alone. Jay-Z made a guest appearance on the Fall Out Boy album Infinity On High. Jay-Z appeared on rapper T.I.'s album T.I. vs. T.I.P. on the song ""Watch What You Say to Me"".

Jay-Z released his tenth album entitled American Gangster on November 6, 2007. After viewing the film, he was heavily inspired to create a new ""concept"" album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler. The album features production from Diddy & The Hitmen, Just Blaze, and The Neptunes, among others. Guest appearances include Beanie Sigel, Lil Wayne, and Nas. The album sold 425,861 copies in it's first week and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Recent years

It was announced on February 2, 2008, that Jay-Z would headline the 2008 Glastonbury Festival, becoming the first major hip hop artist to headline the British festival. Tickets sold out before the opening of the festival. One of the more outspoken critics of his selection was Noel Gallagher of Oasis fame, who criticized the organizers of the festival for scheduling Jay-Z as a headliner for the traditionally guitar-driven festival, stating ""I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music and even when they throw the odd curve ball in on a Sunday night you go 'Kylie Minogue?' I don't know about it. But I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury. It's wrong.""

Controversy ensued in the months leading up to the event with artists, promoters and fans weighing in both for and against. Jay-Z responded to this saying, ""We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other's genre of music and move forward."" In response to Gallagher's criticism, Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis's iconic song ""Wonderwall"". His Glastonbury performance was heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.

He also headlined many other summer festivals in 2008, including Roskilde Festival in Denmark, Hove Festival in Norway and O2 Wireless Festival in London. During Kanye West's August 6, 2008 concert at Madison Square Garden, Jay-Z came out to perform a new song and he and Kanye proclaimed that it was to be on The Blueprint 3. On May 21, 2009, Jay-Z announced he would be parting ways with Def Jam, and had struck a multi-million dollar deal to sign with Live Nation, with whom he would start his Roc Nation imprint which would serve as a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company and also partnered up with production team Stargate to start a record label called StarRoc. Jay-Z's 11th studio album The Blueprint 3 was originally to be released on September 11, 2009, but was instead released in North America on September 8, 2009, due to increasing anticipation. Its international release followed on September 14. It is his 11th album to reach No.1 on the Billboard 200 and has surpassed Elvis Presley's previous record, making him the current solo artist record holder.

On October 9, 2009, Jay-Z kicked off his tour for The Blueprint 3, during which he supported his new album in North America. In a Shave Magazine review of his performance at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Jake Tomlinson expressed that ""It was the type of smooth performance you would expect from the hip-hop superstar."" The review gave this performance 4 stars. His North American tour continued until November 22, 2009. At his concert on November 8, 2009, at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, Rihanna joined him on stage and performed ""Hard"" for the very first time, then performed ""Run This Town"" with Jay-Z. Among his success, Jay-Z has ventured into producing Broadway shows. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, Jay-Z helped produced the play Fela!, a musical celebrating the work of the late Nigerian star Fela Kuti. Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti's work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical. Fela! is a story about an African pioneer and political activist who made his first moves on the scene during the 1970s.

Jay-Z performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2010.
On January 23, 2010, Jay-Z released a track, ""Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)"", with Rihanna, and U2's Bono and The Edge, as well as performing it at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon. In June 2010, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in a pair of concerts in Detroit and New York. The event was dubbed The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts rapidly sold out, prompting the scheduling of an additional show at each venue. Jay-Z was the supporting act for U2 on the Australian and New Zealand leg of their U2 360° Tour, beginning in Auckland, New Zealand in November 2010, followed by Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth in December. He also appeared on stage during U2 performances of ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"", and in Auckland also joined the band for a performance of ""Scarlet"", singing some lines of his song, ""History"". In August 2010, it was revealed that Jay-Z and Kanye West would be collaborating on a five-track EP entitled Watch the Throne. Although, it was later revealed by West that the project had become a full-length LP. Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations and began in November 2010. The first single released for the project was ""H•A•M"". The track was co-produced by Lex Luger and West himself. The track ended up being on the deluxe edition of the album. The follow-up to that was the second single ""Otis"", which premiered on Funkmaster Flex's Hot 97 radio show, and was later released to the iTunes Store eleven days later. The song's existence, along with several other tracks from the album, was confirmed during a listening session hosted by Jay-Z. The album was first released on the iTunes Store, five days prior to it being released in physical format, a strategy Jay-Z later said was used to block an internet leak. It debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Store in 23 countries. It also broke Coldplay's record for most albums sold in one week on the online retailer, selling 290,000 copies on iTunes alone. It held that record, until Lil Wayne's Tha Carter IV was released twenty-one days later, selling only 10,000 copies more. It debuted on the US Billboard 200 chart at No. 1, selling 436,000 copies in its first week. The album received generally positive reviews. Jay-Z and West later gave a surprise performance of ""Otis"" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. In April 2011, Jay-Z launched a blog-like, lifestyle website by the name of Life + Times. It covers everything from music, to fashion, to technology, to sports. The site is curated based on Jay-Z's interests, and he himself works with a small staff to produce every single piece of content.

Jay-Z collaborated with M.I.A. on the single ""XXXO"", which achieved a fair level of success and went on to become remixed by several producers worldwide. In May 2012, Jay-Z and Philadelphia Mayor Michael A. Nutter announced that Jay-Z will be the curator and the headliner for the first annual ""Budweiser Made in America"" festival at Fairmount Park in Philadelphia on September 1 and 2, 2012. The performance will be produced by Live Nation and will assemble an eclectic lineup of “rock, hip hop, R&B, latin music and dance” musicians. Jay-Z and Rihanna are to be the two main headlining acts for BBC Radio 1's 2012 Hackney Weekend music festival on June 23 to 24. Jay-Z opened his set with an appearance from Rihanna, they performed ""Run this Town"". On September 6, ""Clique"" was released, a single for the album ""Cruel Summer"", by GOOD Music. Kanye West and Big Sean star alongside Jay-Z in the track. Jay-Z took the subway to his sold out show at The Barclays Center On October 6, 2012.[91] On November 12, 2012 Coldplay announced that they will be playing with Jay-Z at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31.

On September 23, 2010, Q-Tip confirmed working on Jay-Z's follow up album to The Blueprint 3, saying the album was to hit stores by spring 2011. The album has not yet been released; it has been confirmed 3 songs have been recorded and one of which features Frank Ocean. In May 2012 it was reported that Jay-Z is working on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. In an interview with XXL, Beats stated: ""Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth. He picked a couple of my joints that he’s working on. I don’t even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I haven’t even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent him my favorite stuff. He hit me right back like, ‘Yo, I’ma go in on this,’ or, ‘I like this.’” The album has been named one of the most anticipated albums of 2013 by Complex Magazine, MTV and XXL Magazine. Production will come from Jahlil Beats, Kanye West, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland and Pharrell Williams. Jay-Z also made an appearance on Justin Timberlake's comeback single Suit & Tie from his third studio album The 20/20 Experience, the song itself was produced by both Jay-Z and Timberlake's mutual friend, Timbaland.[97] During the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals, Carter announced that his twelfth studio album would be titled, Magna Carta... Holy Grail and would be released on July 4, 2013. He has been in the studio with various artists such as Drake, Nas, and Justin Timberlake working on the album.[98] In December 2013, it was announced that Jay-Z had received nine nominations at the 2014 Grammy Awards, more than any other artist. Jay-Z appeared on his Beyoncé's self-titled fifth studio album, Beyoncé, with a feature on the song ""Drunk in Love"". They performed this song together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards opening.

Technique

In his earliest appearances, Jay-Z's style was less polished; he had a propensity for rhyming fast, which gradually lessened over the years. By 1996, he had become more known for his metaphors and similes, as well as being a rapper to stress the ordeals of the drug-dealer's life. Later, flow would become a big part of his style.

He has often pointed to his ability to switch from emotionally provocative material like ""Song Cry"" to mainstream topics, such as ""Big Pimpin"", as a sign that he straddles a line between material and intelligent rhymes that not a lot of artists have been able to do. However, he has been criticized for selling out to reach a mainstream audience, and he has acknowledged this on the song ""Moment of Clarity"".

Recently, producers and artists alike have been praising Jay-Z's ability to create verse after verse completely in his head without the aid of a pen and paper. His ability to memorize and recite verbatim line after line of lyrics is praised.

Retirement

On November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert at Madison Square Garden, which would later be the focus of his film Fade to Black. This concert was his ""retirement party."" All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators like The Roots (in the form of his backing band), Missy Elliott, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegel, Freeway, Mary J. Blige, Beyonce, Twista, Ghostface Killah, Foxy Brown, Pharrell and R. Kelly with special appearances by Violetta Wallace and Afeni Shakur; the mothers of Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur respectively.

While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, mash-up projects and concert appearances with R. Kelly, Linkin Park and Phish. These appearances have kept Jay's name in the spotlight and furthered peoples' speculation that he would not remain retired for long.

Jay-Z was the executive producer of Fort Minor's debut album The Rising Tied. Mike Shinoda got together with Jay-Z himself, as well as his Linkin Park bandmate Brad Delson, and they went over what tracks they thought should make the album. Some of the tracks on the album include Remember The Name, Petrified, Believe Me, Where'd You Go and Right Now.

To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the release of Reasonable Doubt, Jay-Z performed a show at Radio City Music Hall on June 25th, 2006 and a rehearsal show at New York's Nokia Theatre one day prior. These shows will be followed by a world tour in September, calling at various cities throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. While locations for the tour have been confirmed, no dates have yet been given apart from 4 dates in the UK and 1 in Ireland.

""I Declare War"" concert

Having been such a visible artist in the late '90s through the early 2000s, Jay has been the subject of more rap-related controversy than most artists in mainstream hip-hop. Some of these have been resolved, some are ongoing, and some have simply dissipated.

On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the ""I Declare War"" Concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event to whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war on. As he had previously ""declared war"" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay upon his rivals. However, an anticipated response to subliminal shots taken by The Game and Cam'ron never materialized.

The theme of the concert was Jay-Z's position as President and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office. Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Rocafella records artists, Ne-Yo, Teairra Mari, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, the LOX, and P. Diddy.

At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many beefs to rest to the surprise of hip-hop fans. Instead of declaring war, he declared that he was the ""United Nations of this rap shit."" The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous beef between Jay-Z and Nas. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z's ""Dead Presidents"" blended with Nas's song ""The World is Yours,"" from which ""Dead Presidents"" had sampled the vocals on the chorus. (Nas's verses were rapped over the ""Dead Presidents"" beat in the vein of a mix song done by DJ Statik Selektah.) Nas later performed songs of his own.

Beefs between other artists were also brought to a close (or put on hold) at the Powerhouse show. The event brought together for the first time in years, P. Diddy and The LOX, both who had a longstanding animosity due to a contract agreement between P. Diddy and The Lox and the latter's departure from Bad Boy Entertainment. Shortly after the concert, the beef was fully rectified.

The event also saw the return of Beanie Sigel from incarceration. There had been some speculation that Beanie Sigel was going to depart from Rocafella Records, but this concert proved otherwise. Beanie and The LOX's Jadakiss also officially ended their own beef when they, Jay-Z, the rest of the LOX and Sauce Money (who had been thought to have some animosity towards Jay) all performed the song ""Reservoir Dogs.""

Hip-Hop entrepreneur

Apart from being former President and CEO of Def Jam Recordings, Jay-Z is also one of the owners and founders of the Roc-A-Fella empire, which includes Roc-A-Fella Records, Roc-La-Familia, Roc-A-Fella Films and Rocawear.

At heart, Jay-Z is an entrepreneur like his fellow hip-hop-moguls-turned-friends Russell Simmons and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, who also have business holdings such as record companies and clothing lines. He redirected the hip hop culture from hooded sweatshirts and baggy jeans to button-ups and crisp jeans, and received GQ's International Man of the Year award.

Roc-A-Fella Records

Jay-Z co-founded Roc-A-Fella Records with partners Damon Dash and Kareem ""Biggs"" Burke. Def Jam purchased a 50% stake in the company in 1997 for a reported $1.5 million.

In late 2004, Jay-Z, Dame Dash and Biggs sold their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and the label was retained as an Island Def Jam imprint. Soon thereafter Jay-Z was appointed the new President and CEO of Def Jam Recordings by Island Def Jam chairman L.A. Reid. Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreement between Jay-Z and Dash as to what new ventures Roc-A-Fella could undertake.

The publicized split between Jay, Dash and Biggs led to the former partners sending jabs at each other in interviews. Dame Dash has made comment that after the break up he was portrayed as ""Osama Bin Laden"" to ensure that rappers would stay with Jay and not sign with him. Dash currently operates the recently-founded Dame Dash Music Group as a joint venture with Island Def Jam producing former Roc-A-Fella artists such as Beanie Sigel.

Universal Music Group announced on December 24th, 2007 that Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter stepped down from his post as president of Def Jam Records. The rapper, 38, served as CEO of the historic hip hop label since 2005. He will continue to work as a solo artist under the Roc-A-Fella / Def Jam umbrella, Reuters reports. Universal did not give a reason for his departure.

Rocawear and fashion

Co-founded in 1999 by Jay-Z, Damon Dash and Kareem ""Biggs"" Burke, Rocawear designed for and sought out a share of the lucrative urban fashion market already being capitalized on by labels like Phat Farm.

In 2005, Jay-Z bought out Rocawear co-founder Dash for an estimated $30 million and has sought to expand the company's reach by developing the S. Carter high-end clothing line. Jay also has a line of Reebok sneakers aptly named The S.Carter Collection, which holds the record for fastest-selling Reebok shoe in history and made him the first non-athlete to have a signature line of sneakers. In the spring of 2006, he is in collaboration with Swiss luxury-watch maker Audemars Piguet.

Entertainment and lifestyle

Jay-Z co-owns The 40/40 Club, an upscale sports bar which started in New York City and has since expanded to Atlantic City, NJ. Future plans will see 40/40 Clubs in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Singapore. Roc-A-Fella also distributes Armadale, a Scottish vodka, in the U.S.

Jay-Z is a part owner of the New Jersey Nets NBA team, and is one of the franchise owners interested in relocating the team to Brooklyn. In October 2005, he was reported in English media as considering a takeover of Arsenal F.C., an English football team.

Personal life

Criminal charges

Jay-Z was accused of stabbing record executive Lance ""Un"" Riviera for what he perceived was Riveria's bootlegging of Vol 3...Life and Times of S. Carter. The stabbing allegedly occurred at the record release party for Q-Tip's debut solo album Amplified at the Kit Kat Klub, a now defunct night club in Times Square, New York City, on December 9, 1999. Jay-Z's associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover when he supposedly stabbed Riviera in the stomach with a five-inch blade.

Jay-Z initially denied the incident and pled not guilty when a grand jury returned the indictment. Jay-Z and his lawyers contended he was nowhere around Riviera during the incident and they had witnesses and videotape evidence from the club that showed Jay-Z's whereabouts during the disturbance. Nevertheless, he later pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge which resulted in a sentence of three months probation. The New York Post reported that Jay-Z had bought out Riviera for $600,000 to cease his cooperation with prosecutors, and without the cooperation of the victim, prosecutors had to cut a plea deal that would not interfere with Jay-Z's touring plans. Riviera also dropped a civil suit, where he asked for $40 million.

Jay-Z makes reference to the trial and incident on his songs ""Izzo (H.O.V.A.)"", off The Blueprint, and ""Dear Summer"", which was included in Memphis Bleek's 2005 release 534.

Rival rapper Cam'ron has since claimed on his song ""You Gotta Love It"" that Jay-Z had actually ""stabbed Un over Charli Baltimore"". Some media moguls have criticized Jay-Z for not fulfilling his position as a role model due to these incidents.

Romantic life

Jay-Z is married to American R&B singer Beyoncé. In 2002, Jay-Z and Beyoncé collaborated for the song ""'03 Bonnie & Clyde"". Jay-Z also appeared on Beyoncé's hit single ""Crazy in Love"" and as well as ""That's How You Like It"" from her debut Dangerously in Love. On her second album,  B'Day, he made appearances on the 2006 hits, ""Déjà Vu"" and ""Upgrade U"". In the video for the latter song, she comically imitates his appearance. The couple generally avoid discussing their relationship. Beyoncé has stated that she believes that not publicly discussing their relationship has helped them. Jay-Z said in a People article, ""We don't play with our relationship."" They kept a low profile while dating, and married quietly in April 2008. It became a matter of public record on April 22, 2008, but Beyoncé did not publicly debut her $5 million Lorraine Schwartz-designed wedding ring until the Fashion Rocks concert on September 5, 2008 in New York City.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z were listed as the most powerful couple for TIME magazine's 100 most influential people of 2006. In January 2009, Forbes ranked them as Hollywood's top-earning couple. They also made it to the top of the list the following year.

On January 7, 2012, she gave birth to their daughter, named Blue Ivy Carter. On January 9, 2012, Jay-Z released ""Glory"", a song dedicated to their child, on his social website LifeandTimes.com.

Death Cab for Cutie,"Death Cab for Cutie is an American indie rock band formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band consists of Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Nicholas Harmer (bass), and Jason McGerr (drums).

Death Cab began as a solo project of Ben Gibbard, now the band's vocalist and guitarist. Gibbard took the band name from the satirical song Death Cab for Cutie, performed by The Bonzo Dog Band in The Beatles' 1967 experimental film Magical Mystery Tour. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords; the release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the band into a complete project. He recruited Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as an electric guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass guitarist, and Nathan Good to play drums. 

The four released the LP Something About Airplanes on August 18th 1998. The album was favorably reviewed in the independent music scene, and in 2000 the band released We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes. Nathan Good left the band at some point during this album's production. His playing on “The Employment Pages” and “Company Calls Epilogue” were kept, but Gibbard played drums on all other songs.

Michael Schorr would first appear on The Forbidden Love E.P., released on October 24, 2000. In 2001, another LP was released, entitled The Photo Album. Limited editions of this album contained three bonus tracks, which were later released separately as The Stability EP.

In 2003, there was another change of drummer, with Jason McGerr of Eureka Farm replacing Schorr. McGerr would play drums on the next release, Transatlanticism.

Transatlanticism was released in October of 2003. It received critical praise and also became the band's top-selling album, with 225,000 copies sold during its first year out.

In spring of 2004, the band recorded a live E.P. titled The John Byrd E.P., named for their sound engineer. The E.P. was released on Barsuk Records in March 2004.

In November of 2004, Death Cab for Cutie signed a “long-term worldwide deal” with Atlantic Records, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the official website www.deathcabforcutie.com that nothing would change except that “Next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7"", there will be the letter ""A"" on both the spine and back of our upcoming albums.” This was a marked change from Gibbard's earlier views on major-label relations, which he said “are set up to fuck you and take all your money.”. After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet.

The first and second singles off the band's Atlantic Record release Plans were “Soul Meets Body” and “Crooked Teeth”, respectively. The full album was released in August of 2005. Plans was somewhat well-acclaimed by critics and fans, and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album of 2005. It achieved Gold Status in 2006 after charting on Billboard for 47 consecutive weeks.

The band released a touring DVD titled Drive Well, Sleep Carefully in 2005. Known for their contributions to animal rights, the band is supporting the activist group PETA in giving away copies of the DVD to promote animal rights.

In early 2006, the band announced the upcoming release of Directions, eleven short films inspired by songs from the Plans album, each directed by a different person. The videos were posted one at a time at the band's website and the DVD went on sale April 11, 2006.

On May 12, 2008 their album, Narrow Stairs, was released  and was well received by both critics and fans. It was their first album to reach #1 on the Billboard 200. The album contains the singles ""I Will Possess Your Heart"", ""Cath..."" and ""Grapevine Fires"".

The band's latest released The Open Door EP, which was released on March 31, 2009. Their main styles consist of slow progressive rock with dark lyrics.

The band's seventh album, Codes and Keys, was released on May 31, 2011. The album's first single was ""You Are A Tourist"".

On October 11, 2013, the band reportedly began working on their eighth studio album. This was then confirmed by the group's official Instagram profile in which an image was uploaded with the caption ""DCFC LP8 begins"". The new album will be produced by Rich Costey and is expected to be released in early 2015. In an interview with Stereogum, Gibbard said of the new album, ""I do think from start to finish it's a much better record than Codes And Keys. If that record turned anybody off, I feel pretty strongly that this one could win them back. There are threads in this one that connect back to our earliest stuff that people love."" On October 29, 2013, the band released a remastered tenth-anniversary version of their 2003 album Transatlanticism. The new album included a vinyl LP and MP3 download, with demos for all the songs from the album.

As part of the 2014 Record Store Day, the band released its first live album, a vinyl-only double LP recorded during various 2012 tour dates with Magik*Magik Orchestra. Included within the packaging was a code for a digital download of the recording.

On August 13, 2014, after 17 years as a member of Death Cab for Cutie, guitarist and songwriter Chris Walla decided to part ways with the band, with his last performance occurring on September 13, 2014 at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia. Walla states that he plans to ""...continue making music, producing records, and erring on the side of benevolence and beauty whenever possible."" When asked in an interview about Walla's involvement in the eighth album, McGerr confirmed that Walla ""played on everything and has been involved all the way through, even in the mixing. Even though he's played his last show with us, he's still been involved in everything involving this record."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Cab+for+Cutie"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bon Jovi,"Bon Jovi is a hard rock band from Sayreville, New Jersey. Fronted by lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi (born John Francis Bongiovi, Jr.), the group originally achieved large-scale success in the 80s. Over the past 25 years, the band has sold over 120 million albums worldwide, 34 million of those sales being in the U.S. alone, making them one of the most successful modern groups of all time. They continue to have widely popular tours.

Bon Jovi formed in 1983. Lead singer Jon Bon Jovi teamed up with guitarist Richie Sambora, keyboardist David Bryan, bassist Alec John Such, and drummer Tico Torres. Other than the departure of Alec John Such in 1994, which pared the lineup down to a quartet, the lineup has remained the same for the past 27 years.

The group took influence from contemporary arena-ready hard rock bands such as Aerosmith and Deep Purple among others while also seeking a catchy, pop-oriented vibe focused on slick guitar and keyboard riffs, with Bon Jovi becoming a key part in what was to become 'pop metal' music. After releasing two moderately successful albums in 1984 and 1985, which resulted in the production of some popular singles such as ""Runaway"" (the band's first Top 40 hit in the U.S.), the band scored big with 'Slippery When Wet' (1986) and 'New Jersey' (1988). Those two albums sold a combined 19 million copies in the U.S. alone, charted eight Top Ten hits, and launched the band into global super-stardom.

After what was just about non-stop touring, the band went on hiatus after the 'New Jersey Tour' in 1990, during which time Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora both released successful solo albums. The rise of alternative rock groups such as Nirvana caused many music industry skeptics to question the staying power of bands labeled as 'glam metal' and 'pop metal' such as Bon Jovi. Yet, in 1992, the group returned with the double-platinum release 'Keep the Faith', proving the doubters wrong, and Bon Jovi has since created a string of RIAA platinum albums throughout the 90s and 00s.

They've been also expanding their musical horizons, combining their usual hard rock with such genres as confessional adult contemporary music and reflective country music. The band has also been credited with inspiring the 'MTV Unplugged' series with their famous sit-down acoustic performance at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. Many critics have praised frontman Jon Bon Jovi's vocal versatility, going from style to style as well as from acoustic to live electric work yet still exciting fans.

In 2006, the band won a Grammy for 'Best Country Collaboration' for ""Who Says You Can't Go Home"" with Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland, and they also became the first rock band to reach #1 on the Hot Country Songs chart with the same song. They have additionally been nominated for Grammy Awards twice for the smash hit ""It's My Life"" (from 2000's 'Crush') and for two songs from the album 'Bounce': ""Misunderstood"" and ""Everyday"".

Throughout their career, the band has released ten studio albums, of which nine have gone platinum. In addition, the band has charted 19 singles to the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, four of which reached #1 (""You Give Love a Bad Name"", ""Livin' On A Prayer"", ""Bad Medicine"", and ""I'll Be There for You""). The band also holds the record for the most weeks for a hard rock album at #1 on the Billboard 200 with Slippery When Wet, as well as the most Top 10 singles from a hard rock album, with New Jersey, which charted five such singles.

In 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included Bon Jovi's 'Slippery When Wet' in the 'Definitive 200 Albums' list, putting it at the #44 slot. On August 17, 2009, the band released the single ""We Weren't Born To Follow"". That hard rockin' track picked up a major fan response and was nominated for a Grammy for 'Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal'.

In May 2010, Bon Jovi released their 11th studio album, named 'The Circle', which included said single. The album debuted at number one in several countries, including the U.S. It sold 163,000 copies in its first week after debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 top albums chart. Since its release, Bon Jovi has underwent more successful tours.

The Kooks,"There are two musical groups with the name The Kooks:

1. British indie rock band - formed in Brighton, England, United Kingdom in 2004. The band currently consists of  Luke Pritchard (vocals, guitar), Hugh Harris (guitar), Peter Denton (bass) and Nick Millard (drums). Nick is currently filling in for Paul Garred due to a recent arm injury. They have released three studio albums; their 2006 debut Inside In/Inside Out peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart, and their 2008 follow up Konk reached number one. The Junk Of The Heart (Happy) Songfacts reports that Pritchard found himself writing lyrics containing a lot of emotional drama for their third album and the phrase ‘junk of the heart’ kept coming back to him. Junk Of The Heart was released September 12, 2011.

The Kooks formed at the Brighton Institute of Modern Music, where they were all students. Lead singer and rhythm guitarist Luke Pritchard, got bassist Max Rafferty involved in a college project, which formed the base of the band. After getting lead guitarist Hugh Harris and drummer Paul Garred involved, they took their name from the song Kooks on the 1971 David Bowie album Hunky Dory. When they tried to trademark the name, they found that in the late/mid 1990s a Swedish band by the same name released an album in Sweden called Too Much is Not Enough.

The Kooks released a debut EP and played gigs around Brighton, where they were based at the time. They were signed to Virgin Records.

2. Swedish indie rock/alternative band - It consisted of members Henrik Berglund, Leo Dahlin, Michael Lohse and Josef Zackrisson, and was active between 1998 and the early 2000's. Micke Lohse and Henrik Berglund are currently members of the band Atomic Swing. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Kooks"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Dire Straits,"Dire Straits were a British rock band from Newcastle, United Kingdom,  formed in 1977 by Mark Knopfler (guitar and vocals), his brother David Knopfler (guitar), John Illsley (bass), and Pick Withers (drums), and subsequently managed by Ed Bicknell. Dire Straits emerged during the post-punk era of the late '70s, and while their sound was minimalistic and stripped down, they owed little to punk. If anything, the band was a direct outgrowth of the roots revivalism of pub rock, but where pub rock celebrated good times, Dire Straits were melancholy. Led by guitarist/vocalist Mark Knopfler, the group built their sound upon the laid-back blues-rock of J.J. Cale, but they also had jazz and country inflections, occasionally dipping into the epic song structures of progressive rock. The band's music was offset by Knopfler's lyrics, which approximated the winding, stream-of-conscious narratives of Bob Dylan. As their career progressed, Dire Straits became more refined and their new maturity happened to coincide with the rise of MTV and the compact disc. These two musical revolutions from the mid-'80s helped make Dire Straits' fifth studio album, Brothers in Arms, an international blockbuster. The band - along with Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, and Steve Winwood - became one of the leaders of a group of self-consciously mature veteran rock & rollers in the late '80s that designed their music to appeal to aging baby boomers. Despite the band's international success, they couldn't sustain their stardom, waiting a full six years to deliver a follow-up to Brothers in Arms, by which time their audience had shrunk significantly.

Knopfler (born August 12, 1949) was always the main force behind Dire Straits. The son of an architect, Knopfler studied English literature at Leeds University and worked briefly as a rock critic for the Yorkshire Evening Post while at college. He began teaching English after his graduation, leading a pub rock band called ""Brewer's Droop"" at night. By 1977, Mark was playing with his brother David (guitar) and his roommate John Illsley (bass). During the summer of 1977, the trio cut a demo with drummer Pick Withers. A London DJ named Charlie Gillett heard the demo and began playing ""Sultans of Swing"" on his BBC show Honky Tonkin'. Following a tour opening for Talking Heads, the band began recording their debut for Vertigo Records with producer Muff Winwood in early 1978. By the summer, they had signed with Warner in America, releasing their eponymous debut in the fall. Thanks to the Top Ten hit ""Sultans of Swing"", Dire Straits was a major success in both Britain and America, with the single and album climbing into the Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic.

The LP ""Dire Straits"" established Dire Straits as a major force on album-oriented radio in America, and their second album, ""Communiqué"" (1979), consolidated their audience, selling three million copies worldwide. As the group was recording its third album, David Knopfler left the band to pursue a solo career; he was replaced by former Darling member Hal Lindes. Like its predecessor, ""Making Movies"" was a sizable hit in America and Britain, even though the band was criticized for musically treading water. Nevertheless, the record went gold on the strength of the radio and MTV hits ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Skateaway"". Dire Straits followed the album two years later with ""Love Over Gold"", an album filled with long, experimental passages, plus the single ""Private Investigations"", which became a number two hit in the United Kingdom. The album went gold in America and spent four weeks at number one in Britain. Shortly after the release of ""Love Over Gold"", former Rockpile drummer Terry Williams replaced Withers.

During 1982, Knopfler began exploring musical avenues outside of Dire Straits, scoring the Bill Forsyth film ""Local Hero"" and playing on Van Morrison's ""Beautiful Vision"". Apart from releasing the ""Twisting by the Pool"" EP early in 1983, Dire Straits were quiet for the majority of 1983 and 1984, as Knopfler produced Bob Dylan's ""Infidels"", as well as Aztec Camera and Willy DeVille; he also wrote ""Private Dancer"" for Tina Turner's comeback album of the same name. 

In the spring of 1984, the band released the double album ""Alchemy: Dire Straits Live"" and by the end of the year, they had begun recording their fifth studio album with their new keyboardist, Guy Fletcher. 

Released in the summer of 1985, ""Brothers in Arms"" was Dire Straits' breakthrough album, making the band international stars. Supported by the groundbreaking computer-animated video for ""Money for Nothing"", a song which mocked music videos, the album became a blockbuster, spending nine weeks at the top of the American charts and selling over nine million copies; in England, the album became the biggest-selling album of the '80s. ""Walk of Life"" and ""So Far Away"" kept ""Brothers in Arms"" in the charts through 1986, and Dire Straits played over 200 dates in support of the album. 

Once the tour was completed, Dire Straits went on hiatus for several years, as Knopfler produced records by Randy Newman and Joan Armatrading, scored films, toured with Eric Clapton, and recorded a duet album with Chet Atkins: ""Neck and Neck"" (1990). In 1989, he formed the country-rock group Notting Hillbillies, whose sole album, ""Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time"", became a British hit upon its spring 1990 release. During the extended time off, John Illsley recorded his second album; the first appeared in 1984.

In 1990, Knopfler reconvened Dire Straits, which now featured Illsley, Clark, Fletcher, and various session musicians. The band released ""On Every Street"" in autumn 1991 to great anticipation. However, the album failed to meet expectations - it only went platinum in America but went to number one in the UK charts and most of Europe - it failed to generate a hit single in the UK.  The tour embarked on was massive but may have been a bit of a disappointment, with many tickets going unsold in both the U.S. and Europe. Once the tour was completed, the live album ""On the Night"" was released in the spring of 1993 and the band again went on hiatus. 

Dire Straits released one last album in 1995, Live at the BBC, as a contractual album release to Vertigo Records.  That same year, Knopfler disbanded the group.

In 1996, Knopfler launched his solo career. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

After his judges’ houses performance of «I Can’t Make You Love Me», he was picked by his mentor Nicole Scherzinger as one of the 12 contestants for the live shows, and one of just three in the «Boys» category. After the second live show, Arthur suffered from an anxiety attack backstage.

Röyksopp,"Röyksopp is an electronic music duo formed in 1998 in Tromsø, Norway and currently based in Bergen, Norway. The band consists of Torbjørn Brundtland and Svein Berge, both being songwriters, producers and remixers.

Brundtland and Berge were schoolmates in their hometown Tromsø, experimenting with electronic instruments in the early 90s and being a part of their city's techno scene. As they grew up in northern Norway, they listened to local artists like Bel Canto and Biosphere.

Talking Heads first appeared on the New York music scene as a trio in 1974. At the time, the band consisted only of Byrne, Frantz and Weymouth and was initially called The Artistics. By 1975, the band had recorded a demo album for CBS Records and landed a gig opening for the Ramones at CBGB in June 1975, which was the first time the band used the name Talking Heads. The band was signed to Sire Records in late 1976 and the group released their first single, ""Love → Building on Fire"" in February 1977. In March 1977, the band added Jerry Harrison, formerly of Jonathan Richman's band The Modern Lovers.  

Their first album, Talking Heads: 77 was released soon afterward and did not contain the earlier single, although it did include the underground singles Psycho Killer and Uh-Oh, Love Comes To Town. Despite being regulars at New York's legendary CBGB, the band only began to break through further with the landmark Brian Eno-produced, 1978 album More Songs About Buildings And Food, an album which continued in the same vein, but with a more accessible style, wittier lyrics, and ultimately better songs. It was a great critical hit with subject matter ranging from home movies to the art world.  It also included their cover of Take Me To The River. On the following year's Fear Of Music the band started to dabble in African rhythms, notably on I Zimbra, and more straightforward pop styles, on Life During Wartime and Cities.

1980 brought the band's fourth and most innovative effort Remain In Light. Notable for the single Once In A Lifetime, which became an early MTV staple, Remain In Light saw the band experiment with ambient sounds, fugal structures, polyrhythms, and about everything under the sun to make the body groove. Following this, the group split with Brian Eno, enjoying greater commercial success with 1983's Speaking In Tongues. It took the musical innovations of its predecessor and refined them into pop songs, most notably Burning Down The House, Girlfriend Is Better and This Must Be The Place. This period was topped off with a live album, from Jonathan Demme's documentary, Stop Making Sense. The documentary, with its name taken from a line in Girlfriend Is Better, was a great success, and took their inimitable style to a wider audience.

1985's Little Creatures was an even bigger hit, and exhibited another stylistic shift for the band. It saw the punk styles of '77 almost completely abandoned for simple, three or four chord pop songs. The album produced the singles And She Was, and Road To Nowhere. The following two albums, True Stories and Naked, were both moderate successes, the former producing their biggest radio hits, Love For Sale and Wild Wild Life,  and the latter focusing more on Latin influences with hits like (Nothing But) Flowers.  After this, a long quiet period followed, with the band eventually officially announcing their break up in 1991. Since the split, Byrne continued his solo career and Weymoth and Frantz continued to record and tour as Tom Tom Club. Weymouth, Harrison and Frantz reunited for an album, ""No Talking, Just Head"", recorded under the name The Heads in 1996.

The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. The band reunited for a three song performance at the ceremony. Due to personality conflicts between Byrne and the other members, further reunions are unlikely.

Shakira,"Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll (born February 2, 1977), known simply as Shakira, is a Grammy-award winning Colombian singer-songwriter, musician, composer, record producer, music-video director, dancer, choreographer, model, game creative director, businesswoman, multi instrumentalist and philanthropist  who has sold over eighty million albums worldwide. She has won two Grammy awards, ten Latin Grammy awards, seven Billboard Music Awards, twenty-seven Latin Billboard Awards and has been nominated for a Golden Globe. She has been in the music industry since 1990, releasing her first album the following year. A child prodigy, she began writing poems and songs at age four and taught herself the guitar at age ten. The death of a half sibling and her father's reaction to it inspired her to write her first full song at age eight. 

Little known outside her native Colombia, it wasn't until 1995 when Shakira took full creative control over her music, a fusion of rock and dance pop with both deeply personal and biting political lyrics. The approach yielded two multiplatinum albums. In 2001, she broke through into the English-speaking market with the release of her first album in that language, Laundry Service, which she wrote and produced herself and which has sold 3,5 million copies in the United States and 15 million (sometimes stated as 20 million) copies worldwide. The album's massive sales came in large part thanks to the worldwide hit, ""Whenever, Wherever"" a dance song with unique Andean instrumentation which soon became one of the highest selling singles of the 21st century. 

Shakira is half Lebanese, one quarter Spanish, and one quarter Italian. She was born to a Colombian mother of Catalan and Italian descent, Nidia del Carmen Ripoll Torrado, and a Lebanese father, William Mebarak Chadid, in Barranquilla, Colombia, where she says she grew up among the Lebanese and Italian communities. Her father was born in Lebanon, and immediately after that, his family migrated to New York, but he soon migrated to Colombia. Shakira, which means ""grateful"" in Arabic (شاكرة), is named after her paternal grandmother. She was one of seven siblings, one of whom is her road manager. Shakira attended a Catholic school and in second grade was rejected for the school choir because her vibrato was too strong.[2] She began writing and composing music at the age of eight and later choreographed dance routines. At school, she says she had been known as ""the belly dancer girl"", as she would demonstrate a number she learned every Friday at school. ""That's how I discovered my passion for live performance,"" she says.[3] One of the first songs she wrote was called ""Tus Gafas Oscuras"" (Your Dark Glasses), which was about her father's grief over a son who had died in a car accident.

Between the ages of ten and thirteen Shakira was invited to various events in Barranquilla and gained some recognition in the area. It was at about this time that she met local theater producer Monica Ariza, who was impressed with her and as a result tried to help her career. During a flight from Barranquilla to Bogotá, Ariza convinced Sony Colombia executive Ciro Vargas to hold an audition for Shakira in a motel lobby. Vargas held Shakira in high regard and, returning to the Sony office, gave the cassette to a song and artist director. However, the director was not overly excited and thought Shakira was something of ""a lost cause"". Vargas, not daunted, was still convinced that Shakira had talent, and set up an audition in Bogotá. He arranged for Sony Colombia executives to arrive at the audition, with the idea of surprising them with Shakira's performance. She performed three songs for the executives and impressed them enough for her to be signed to record three albums.

Magia (Magic) was Shakira's debut album, recorded with Sony Colombia in 1991, when she was 13. The album did not fare well commercially, selling less than one thousand copies. After Magia, Shakira released Peligro (Danger) in 1993. The album was better received than Magia, though it was considered a commercial failure, due to Shakira's refusal to advertise it.

Shakira then decided to take a hiatus from recording so that she could graduate from high school.

Shakira returned to recording in 1995, supported by a new confessional and Alanis Morissette-oriented persona that affected some of her next albums, and made her third studio one, Pies Descalzos (Bare Feet), bring her great fame in Latin America. The singles ""Estoy Aquí"" (I'm Here), ""Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos"" (Bare Feet, White Dreams), and ""Dónde Estás Corazón?"" (Where Are You, My Heart?) became pop culture icons. Pies Descalzos sold more than 4 million copies, which prompted the release of a remix album, titled simply The Remixes, which sold more than a million copies. The Remixes also included Portuguese versions of some of her best-known songs, which were recorded because of her success in the Brazilian market.

Her fourth album, ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? (Where Are The Thieves?), was released in 1998. It was produced by Emilio Estefan, reportedly cost US$3 million, and had more of a polished sound than Pies Descalzos. It was even more successful and solidified her as one of the major Latin artists of the 1990s. She began to gain more fans in non-Spanish-speaking countries like France, Switzerland, Canada, and especially the United States. Eight of the album's eleven tracks became singles, including ""Ciega, Sordomuda""(Blind, Deaf, and Mute), ""Moscas En La Casa"" (Flies in the House), ""No Creo"" (I Don't Believe), ""Inevitable"", ""Tú"" (You), ""Si Te Vas"" (If You Leave), ""Octavo Día"" (Eighth Day), and the world-famous ""Ojos Así""(Eyes Like Yours). Shakira's first live album, MTV Unplugged, was composed of ""Estoy Aquí"" and the songs from ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones?.

In 2001, upon the success of ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones?, Shakira began working on a crossover album to the English language. Collaborating with Gloria Estefan, Shakira wrote and recorded English versions of the tracks from ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones?. However, Shakira later decided against using translations of older songs for the album and worked for over a year on new material for the album. The result was Laundry Service. Although it was created for the intent of selling to an English language market, the rock and Spanish dance-influenced album also featured four Spanish songs, including ""Que Me Quedes Tú"" (I Hope You Stay With Me). Some critics claimed that Shakira's English skills were too weak for her to write in it, but Laundry Service was a success, with more than 13 million sales worldwide, yielding the worldwide hit ""Whenever, Wherever"" and singles ""Underneath Your Clothes"" (a Canadian number-one), ""Te Dejo Madrid"" (I Leave You Madrid), ""Objection (Tango)"", and ""The One"". The album and its singles helped to establish Shakira's musical presence in the mainstream North American market.

Shakira stayed out of the spotlight for 2 and a half years, notably changing her hair style. She later announced Oral Fixation 1 and 2 due in 2005. Fijación Oral Vol. 1 was released on June 6, 2005 in Europe and on June 7, 2005 in North America and Australia. The lead single ""La Tortura"" (English: The Torture, featuring Alejandro Sanz) eventually reached number one in Spain and number twenty-three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. In Canada, ""La Tortura"" also became the highest-charting Spanish song when it debuted and peaked at number twenty-one. Its success across the rest of the world was widespread and it managed to peak within the top ten of the majority of the charts it entered. In the U.S., ""La Tortura"" spent a record twenty-five weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart. The single in partnership with Alejandro Sanz became the best-selling Spanish single of all time according to Guiness World Records.

Fijación Oral Vol. 1 was simultaneously released in Latin America. It debuted at number one in Spain and at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200. It was also well-received in non-Spanish speaking countries such as Italy, Greece and Germany, where it reached number one, Austria, where it reached number three, and Canada and Hungary, where it reached number seven. The second single from Fijación Oral Vol. 1, ""No"" (English: No), was released in September 2005, and peaked at number one in Spain and Colombia, for fourteen non-consecutive weeks. So far, Fijación Oral Vol. 1 has sold five million copies worldwide. Her third single from ""Fijación Oral vol. 1"", Día de Enero, is dedicated to her fiance, Antonio de la Rúa. This single was number one in some countries in Latin America, but it hadn't got success like ""La Tortura"" and ""No"". She also performed ""La Tortura"" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards in Miami with Alejandro Sanz. It was the first ever Spanish performance at the VMA's.

Shakira's second English album Oral Fixation Vol. 2 was released on November 29, 2005 in North America and Australia, and also at this time in Continental Europe. While ""Don't Bother"" was warmly received by music critics as the album's lead single, it failed to peak within the U.S. top 40. The second single ""Hips Don't Lie"" (featuring Wyclef Jean) became her first single to reach number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart. On March 28, 2006, she re-released Oral Fixation Vol. 2 in the U.S. and released it June 19, 2006. Shakira also had the collaboration of Argentinian Rock en Español legend Gustavo Cerati on 2 tracks of both Oral Fixation albums. ""Hips Don't Lie"" is now considered Shakira's most successful song, since it topped the charts in more than 55 countries and turned into the highest-selling single of the 21st century in accordance to Harvard University.

In 2000, Shakira started dating Antonio de la Rúa, the son of then president of Argentina Fernando de la Rúa, a romance that made headline news throughout Latin America. In March of 2001, he proposed to her. During Fernando De la Rúa's presidency, the economy of Argentina collapsed, leading to the subsequently violent December 2001 riots; in response to the turmoil, Tower Records decided to no longer sell Shakira's albums [6] in Argentina as Antonio was directly involved in the management of his father's administration. De la Rúa and Shakira remain engaged, with future plans to marry.

Shakira is well-known for her dancing in various music videos. The moves are based on the art of belly dancing, a part of her Lebanese heritage, which Shakira says she learned as a young teen to overcome her shyness. The intense training has afforded her a fluidity in her body movement most seen in the video to her hit ""La Tortura"". In an MTV interview, she said people told her she never moved her chest when dancing, so she danced with her chest (as well as her usual belly dancing moves) in the videos for ""La Tortura"" and ""Hips Don't Lie"".

She has had several belly dance choreographers, including award-winning Bellydance Superstar Bozenka. As her MTV 'The Making of...' special shows, she worked with Jamie King for the choreography, but ended up creating most of it herself <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Shakira"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Nine Inch Nails,"Nine Inch Nails is a Cleveland, OH, USA, Industrial rock band that was formed in 1988 by Trent Reznor, the only constant member of the band. He's generally credited for popularizing the genre known as ""industrial rock"" with both his releases and dark, theatrical music videos.

Born Michael Trent Reznor, he was raised by his maternal grandparents in Mercer, Pennsylvania, USA. Reznor took up piano at the age of five and in high school took up the tuba and saxophone. In the early to mid-80s, Trent played with various synthpop and new wave groups such as Exotic Birds and Option 30 before beginning his solo project. 

As a member of Exotic Birds, he appeared in the Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett  film Light of Day. He also was mentioned on local TV as a proponent of electronic music in general. Before the 1989 release of NIN's first album, 'Pretty Hate Machine', he worked for Right Track Studio as a handyman heavily interested in recording technology. Both the name of Reznor's band and the title of his second single, ""Head Like a Hole"", came from remarks by Al Jourgensen of Ministry, Reznor's biggest influence.

Nine Inch Nails has issued eight major albums, which have generally received both critical and commercial acclaim. Historically, NIN releases have been assigned a ""Halo"" index number. For example, the album 'With Teeth' is also known as Halo 19. With the inclusion of the 'Broken' EP, the band's primary releases are:

1. 'Pretty Hate Machine' (1989)
2. 'Broken' EP (1992)
3. 'The Downward Spiral' (1994)
4. 'The Fragile (Left)' / ''The Fragile (Right)' (1999)
5. 'With Teeth' (2005)
6. 'Year Zero' (2007)
7. 'Ghosts I-IV' (2008)
8. 'The Slip' (2008)
9. 'Hesitation Marks' (2013)

Nine Inch Nails has also produced a number of EP's, remixes, and provided contributions to various movie soundtracks, including 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider', 'The Crow', 'Natural Born Killers', 'Lost Highway', and 'Tetsuo: The Bullet Man'. Trent Reznor additionally provided the soundtrack for the massively popular id Software game Quake, a release inspired by ambient music. His team up with Atticus Ross resulted in the critically praised soundtrack to the film 'The Social Network', with the Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross duo winning an Oscar for Best Original Score at the 83rd Academy Awards

In 2002, a live album (their second live release, the first being the video 'Closure Documentary') entitled 'And All That Could Have Been' was released on DVD & CD. The Deluxe version of the CD came packaged with a mini album called 'Still'. That release featured several previously released songs in a stripped down, near-acoustic format along with several other new compositions.

Nine Inch Nails as a live band is generally understood to be a separate entity from its recording studio-based component. Occasionally, past band members are invited to participate in the process when not directly involved with recording new material, Nine Inch Nails' lineup tends to change drastically between major tours. Aside from Trent Reznor remaining on lead vocals, nothing about the live band has remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes.

Beginning in late 2005, the live band featured Aaron North on guitar, Jeordie White on bass guitar, Alessandro Cortini on keyboards, and Josh Freese on drums, though all occasionally performed with different instruments. This lineup toured Europe, Asia, Australia, and America through 2007. Trent Reznor reported that he would disband the ""rock band configuration"" of his touring lineup after their concert in Honolulu, Hawaii on September 18, 2007, and would explore other means to perform Nine Inch Nails material on subsequent tours. Despite this claim he has regained the rock group lineup for the 'Lights In The Sky Over...' tours with Robin Finck returning on guitar and Justin Meldal-Johnsen of Beck and other projects accompanying Cortini and Freese.

Past live band members include (listed chronologically):

* Ron Musarra: Drums, Samplers
* Chris Vrenna: Keyboards, Samplers, Drums
* Richard Patrick: Guitar
* Jeff Ward: Drums
* David Haymes: Keyboards
* Nick Rushe: Keyboards
* Lee Mars: Keyboards
* James Woolley: Keyboards
* Robin Finck: Guitar, Synthesizer
* Danny Lohner: Bass, Guitar, Synthesizer
* Charlie Clouser: Synthesizer, Drums on 5 songs during the Dissonance side of David Bowie's Outside tour, Theremin
* Sean Beavan: Soundboard, Backing vocals on 5 songs
* Jerome Dillon: Drums
* Alex Carapetis: Drums
* Ilan Rubin: Drums

The September 14, 2007 edition of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported that the September 18 show in Honolulu, Hawaii would be the last performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Trent Reznor was quoted as stating, ""at this point, I want to switch things around a bit. Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again. I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. I don't want it to go stale.""

A DVD/Blu-Ray/HD-DVD of live material from the 2006 With Teeth tour was released in late February 2007 entitled Nine Inch Nails Live: Beside You In Time. All three formats include 24 songs from the summer and winter 2006 tours, plus bonus material.

Information about Nine Inch Nails concerts can be found on the NIN website.

Ghosts I-IV was released on March 2, 2008. It contains 36 instrumental tracks and was recorded in ten weeks of fall 2007. Initially intended to be a five-track EP, the album is presented in the form of four nine-track EPs. The tracks do not have names, and are only identified by their track listing and position on the EPs.  Ghosts I-IV also adds to the recent experimentation with digital distribution; the album is available in many different ways, including a digital download, for purchase or (partially) free, a CD set, and a deluxe edition set.

The eighth album called ""The Slip"" was officially released on May 5, 2008. The whole album can be downloaded for free from this website: Nine Inch Nails - The Slip

On February 16th 2009, Trent announced that he would begin his last tour. Nine Inch Nails would indefinitely end. However, it is not likely that this is the end of his music career. In his letter, he hinted that he may do something with Jane's Addiction. In addition, Reznor has said outright in an interview on the official website that he is not done making music as Nine Inch Nails, but that he is done touring.

My Chemical Romance,"My Chemical Romance was an American rock band from New Jersey, United States formed in 2001. The band consisted of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro. and Frank Iero, bassist Mikey Way and keyboardist James Dewees. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002.

Elvis Presley,"Elvis Aaron Presley (Tupelo, Mississippi, January 8, 1935 - Memphis, Tennessee, August 16, 1977), was an American singer, song producer and actor. A cultural icon, he is widely known by the single name Elvis. 

Elvis Presley began his music career at Sun Records in the spring of 1954 when Sam Philips recorded Elvis performing several of Elvis' favorite songs with Scotty Moore (guitar) and Bill Black (bass).  One of these covers was a country and western song, ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"".
Elvis is the best-selling solo artist of all time in the United States with confirmed 189.2 million records in RIAA shipments.

Before Sam Philips sold Elvis' contract to RCA Victor in 1956 for $35,000 they had recorded six two-sided singles.  Each of these recordings featured a country and western song on one side and a rhythm and blues song on the other.  One of the reasons Elvis was so popular was because of his ability to merge attributes of what was perceived to be ""white"" (C&W) and ""black"" (R&B) music.  An example of this is evident in Elvis' hit song ""Heartbreak Hotel"" which reached #1 not only in the Pop charts, but the R&B and C&W charts as well.  This was the first time that a single song held the #1 spot in all three charts.  

Elvis remains a popular and enigmatic star. His legend has only grown stronger since his death. In fact, there is a widespread belief that Elvis—who was known by his first name—did not die in 1977. Many fans persist in claiming he is still alive, that he went into hiding for various reasons. This claim is allegedly backed up by thousands of so-called Elvis sightings that have occurred in the years since his death, and by the fact that his middle name Aron was misspelled Aaron, with two As, on his tombstone.

During an active recording career that spanned more than two decades, Presley set and broke many records for both concert attendance and sales. Some of those records have since been matched and/or broken by other artists, but some of his records will probably remain unbroken and/or unmatched forever. He has had more than 120 singles in the US top 40, across various musical genres, with over 20 reaching number one.

Elvis Aaron (sometimes spelled Aron) Presley, in the humblest of circumstances, was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. He and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1948, and Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953.

Biography: Elvis' musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church and at the all-night gospel sings he frequently attended, and the black R&B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, he began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. By 1956, he was an international sensation. With a sound and style that uniquely combined his diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time, he ushered in a whole new era of American music and popular culture.

He starred in 33 successful films, made history with his television appearances and specials, and knew great acclaim through his many, often record-breaking, live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 150 different albums and singles, far more than any other artist. Among his many awards and accolades were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36, and his being named One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation for 1970 by the United States Jaycees. Without any of the special privileges his celebrity status might have afforded him, he honorably served his country in the U.S. Army.

His talent, good looks, sensuality, charisma, and good humor endeared him to millions, as did the humility and human kindness he demonstrated throughout his life. Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture. Health problems, drug dependency and other factors are said to have led to his premature death at age 42 at his Memphis home, Graceland, on August 16, 1977. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Police,"The Police were a new wave band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- ""Outlandos d'Amour"" (1978), ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (1979), ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" (1980), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1982) and ""Synchronicity"" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986

The band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. 

Biography 

The Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.

The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.

The Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and base lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other ""white"" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of ""Babylon"", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like ""Roxanne"".

Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. 

In 1992 the band released ""Message in a Box"", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.

The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. 

Sting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; ""Tea in the Sahara"" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .

Years & Years,
The Prodigy,"The Prodigy are a Braintree, Essex, UK, electronic music group (aka Prodigy), formed by Liam Howlett (composition, keyboards), in 1990. They have sold over 20 million records worldwide, which is almost unequalled in dance music history.

Their music consists of various styles ranging from rave and breakbeat hardcore in the early 90s to alternative rock and big beat, with punk vocal elements in later times. Other current band members include:  Keith Flint (dancing, vocals), Maxim (MCing, vocals, live guitarist Rob Holliday (Marilyn Manson, Gary Numan, Curve, Sulpher) and Leo Crabtree as a live drummer.

Leeroy Thornhill (dancing, occasional live keyboards), was a member of the band from 1990 to 2000, as well was a female dancer / vocalist Sharky, who left the band during their early period.  Other notable former live members include: Gizz Butt (guitar - English Dogs, Janus Stark, Sabbat) - toured with the band for three years throughout the late '90s, Kieron Pepper (drum - Realtv, Happy Gilmore) - played for the group from 1997 to 2007 (also contributing to the solo projects of Maxim and Flint's band, Flint), as well as Jim Davies (guitar - Pitchshifter), who also performed in Flint.

The Prodigy first emerged on the underground rave scene in the early 1990, releasing their début LP Experience (1992) and have since then achieved immense popularity and worldwide renown.  Some of their most popular songs include ""Charly"", ""Out of Space"", ""No Good (Start the Dance)"", ""Voodoo People"", ""Firestarter"", ""Breathe"" and ""Smack My Bitch Up"".

The name displayed on album covers changed from 'The Prodigy' to 'Prodigy' between Music for the Jilted Generation and The Fat of the Land (1997) and back again with the release of Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned (2004). However, Howlett has attested the title has always been 'The Prodigy' and the change was made only to fit within the displayed logo.

Maxim originally began as an MC for the band before doing vocals on ""Poison"", a track on their second album Music for the Jilted Generation and then several others on The Fat of the Land.  He remains a member, MCing at the live shows.

Flint began as a dancer for the band before moving on to become a vocalist initially on the track ""Firestarter"" but then for several others on the third album The Fat of the Land.  Flint is probably the most visually recognisable member of the band and considered by many to be the front-man though he has very little input to writing the songs. He still sings with the live show but has virtually no input on the albums however, he did write the single ""Baby's Got a Temper"".

Following the relative commercial and critical failure of 2004's Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned the band released a greatest hits Their Law: The Singles 1990-2005 before 2009's return to form Invaders Must Die.

After the release and success of  The Fat of the Land, Howlett was feeling down as he could not produce any songs up to standard up until one of his friends showed him the program Reason from Propellerhead Software. This program inspired him who instantly went to the studio and started producing tracks using it; he decided he did not want to use it for baselines though, as he prefers the analogue sound. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The 1975,"The 1975 are an indie rock band which formed in 2002 in Manchester.

Björk,"Björk Guðmundsdóttir, (born 21 November 1965 in Reykjavík, Iceland) known mononymously as Björk, is an Icelandic singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer and occasional actress. Her musical career began when she was eleven with her study of classical piano in elementary school. One of her instructors sent a recording of Björk singing Tina Charles' song I Love to Love to RÚV, then the only radio station in Iceland. The recording was broadcast on national radio - after hearing it, a representative of the Fálkinn label contacted Guðmundsdóttir, to offer a record contract, and Björk was recorded and released in 1977. In November 1979, her eponymous first album was released; the record contained covers of several pop songs, including the The Fool on the Hill and boasted artwork from her mother and guitar work from her stepfather. Björk became a hit within Iceland and was not released in any other country.

Björk's musical tastes were changed by the punk revolution of the late '70s; in 1979, she formed a post-punk group called Exodus and, in the following year, she sang in Jam 80.

In her teens, Björk was influenced by punk; at 14 she formed the all-girl punk band Spit and Snot, shortly followed by the jazz fusion group, Exodus in 1979. In 1980 she graduated from music school. In 1981 she and bassist Jakob Magnússon formed another band called Jam-80, which later became Tappi Tíkarrass (which means ""Cork the Bitch’s Ass"" in Icelandic), and released an extended single, ""Bítið Fast í Vítið in the same year. Their next album, Miranda, was released in 1983.

Afterward, Björk collaborated with Einar Örn Benediktsson and Einar Melax from Purrkur Pillnikk, and Guðlaugur Óttarsson, Sigtryggur Baldursson, and Birgir Mogensen from Þeyr. After writing songs and rehearsing for two weeks, the new band, KUKL (""sorcery"" in Icelandic), developed a sound described as Gothic rock. Björk began to show indications of her trademark singing style, which was punctuated by howls and shrieks.

KUKL toured Iceland with anarchist UK punk band, Crass, and later visited the UK in a series of performances with Flux of Pink Indians. They produced two albums as a result of these collaborations: The Eye in 1984, and Holidays in Europe in 1986, both on Crass Records.

The band was eventually dissolved, in part due to the closure of their label, Gramm. In mid-1986, several members of KUKL and the surrealist group, Medusa, got together to create the arts collective Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). They created a musical division, a band again called KUKL, but soon changed the name to The Sugarcubes.

Björk first came to prominence as one of the lead vocalists of the avant-pop Icelandic sextet the The Sugarcubes, but when she launched a solo career after the group's 1992 demise, she quickly eclipsed her old band's popularity. Instead of following in the Sugarcubes' arty guitar rock styles, Björk immersed herself in dance and club culture, working with many of the biggest names in the genre, including Nellee Hooper, Underworld, and Tricky. Debut, her first solo effort (except for an Icelandic-only smash released when she was just 11 years old), not only established her new artistic direction, but it became an international hit, making her one of the '90s most unlikely stars.

The Sugarcubes became one of the rare Icelandic bands to break out of their native country when their debut album, Life's Too Good, became a British and American hit in 1988. For the next four years, the group maintained a successful cult following in the U.K. and the U.S. while they were stars within Iceland. During 1990, Björk recorded a set of jazz standards and originals with an Icelandic bebop group called Björk Guðmundsdóttir & tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar. The album, Gling-Gló, was released only in Iceland. By 1992, tensions between Björk and Einar had grown substantially, which resulted in the band splitting apart.

Following the breakup of the group, Björk moved to London, where she began pursuing a dance-oriented solo career. The previous year, she had sung on Ooops, which sparked her interest in club and house music. She struck up a working relationship with Nellee Hooper, a producer who had formerly worked with Soul II Soul and Massive Attack. The first result of their partnership was Human Behaviour which was released in June of 1993. ""Human Behaviour"" became a Top 40 hit in the U.K., setting the stage for the surprising number three debut of the full-length album, Debut. Throughout 1993, Björk had hit U.K. singles -- including Venus as a Boy, Big Time Sensuality, and the non-LP Play Dead, a collaboration with David Arnold taken from the film Young Americans -- as well as modern rock radio hits in the U.S. She earned rave reviews in both countries. At the end of the year, NME magazine named Debut the album of the year. Additionally, she won BRIT Awards for both International Female Solo Artist and Newcomer. Debut went gold in the U.S. and platinum in the U.K.

During 1994, Björk was relatively quiet as she recorded her second album with Nellee Hooper, Tricky, 808 State's Graham Massey, and Howie B of Mo' Wax Records. She also released a remix EP, co-wrote the title track for Bedtime Stories, and performed on MTV Unplugged that same year. Army of Me, the first single from Björk's forthcoming album, Post, was released as a teaser single in the spring of 1995. It debuted at number ten in the U.K. and became a moderate alternative rock hit in the U.S. Post, her second full-length solo album, was released in June of 1995 and garnered positive reviews. It peaked at number two in the U.K. and number 32 in the U.S. Post matched its predecessor in terms of sales and praise, going gold in the U.S. and helping her earn her second BRIT Award for Best International Female Artist. It yielded the British hit singles Isobel (#23), It's Oh So Quiet (#4) and Hyperballad (#8). Despite her commercial success in the UK, her singles failed to make much headway on American radio or MTV. 

In late 1996, she released Telegram, an album of radically different remixes of the entire Post album, in the U.K. Its American release followed in January 1997. 

Homogenic was released on 23 September 1997 and spawned many remix releases in the next few years to follow. 

In the spring of 2000, she was named Best Actress by jurors at the Cannes Film Festival for her work in Lars von Trier's Palme d'Or-winning Dancer in the Dark. Selmasongs, her score for the film, reunited Björk with her Homogenic collaborator, Mark Bell, and arrived in Fall of 2000, just in time for Dancer in the Dark's U.S. release. 

The full-length follow-up, Vespertine, was released one year later. Verspertine featured collaborations with electronic duo Matmos, who handled intricate micro-beats while Björk layered her voice in melodic, lyrical passages. 

She released a Greatest Hits collection and the Family Tree box set late in 2002. 

After performing a few dates in 2003, Björk worked on her all-vocals and vocal samples-based album, Medúlla, and a performance of its first single, Oceania, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. 

The soundtrack to Drawing Restraint 9, a film by multimedia artist Matthew Barney, arrived in 2005 and also featured contributions from Will Oldham. Bjork also starred in the film, which would never see a DVD release and is only viewable in select art museums. 

Her next album, Volta, was released on 8 May 2007. Volta features collaborations with Timbaland, Mark Bell, and Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons. The album's first single, Earth Intruders, was released digitally on 9 April 2007. 

Her album, Biophilia, was released on the 5th of October, 2011, with Björk and 16bit producing.

Her latest album, Vulnicura, was released on January 20, 2015, to rave reviews.
		 
She also sang on the contemporary classical composer John Tavener's piece Prayer Of The Heart.

Her record label, One Little Indian, reported in 2003 that she had sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. She has been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards (including one for acting). For her performance in Dancer in the Dark, Björk won the Best Actress Award at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. She was ranked #36 on VH1's ""The 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll"" and #8 on MTV's ""22 Greatest Voices in Music"".

Eric Clapton,"Eric Clapton (born Eric Patrick Clapp in Ripley, Surrey, England on 30 March 1945), nicknamed ""Slowhand"", is a Grammy Award winning English composer, singer and guitarist who became one of the most respected artists of the rock era, winning three inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 

Clapton's musical style has changed during his career, but has remained rooted in the blues. Clapton is credited as an innovator in several phases of his career, which have included blues-rock with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and The Yardbirds (1963-1965), early single hit ""Come With Me"" by The Roosters,  blues-hard rock (with Cream), and work as a sideman and a solo artist; he has achieved chart success in genres ranging from Delta blues (Unplugged) and psychedelic rock (Sunshine of Your Love) to pop (Change the World) and reggae (I Shot the Sheriff).

Eric Clapton  was a friend of George Harrison of the Beatles.  It is believed that he wrote  Layla about Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd, whom he married in 1979 after she divorced George Harrison. They divorced in 1988. Eric Clapton has also dated singers Marianne Faithfull and Rosanne Cash, actresses Patsy Kensit and Sharon Stone, and rock muses Cynrinda Fox and Geraldine Edwards, who was one of the inspirations for Penny Lane in Almost Famous. He is now married to Melia McEnry and has been since 2002. They have three daughters together.

Clapton formed relationships with different artists in his career.  From his start in The Yardbirds, then journeying forward to Cream, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Derrek and the Dominoes, he is an extremely gifted musician.  Clapton would go on to play lead guitar in Roger Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitchiking.  All this while compiling hit after hit in his solo career, has made Clapton one of the most enduring guitarists of the classic rock era.

""Tears in Heaven"" was written after his son's tragic death. It was co-written with Russ Titelman and acknowledged with a Grammy in 1993.

Most recently, Eric Clapton has organized a benefit concert in honor of Hubert Sumlin, the great bluesman, that took place at the Apollo Theater in New York on February 24, 2012. He was joined by Jeff Beck, Keb Mo, Levon Helm,  and Derek Trucks among others. Clapton is known to sponsor an array of charitable events and concerts. He has also established a rehabilitation clinic in Monserrat to help those with substance abuse problems.

'Clapton' was released on September 27, 2010 by Reprise. 

A live album titled Play The Blues Live At Lincoln Center performed with Wynton Marsellis was released on September 13, 2011 by Reprise. 

Early 2013 saw the release of 'Old Sock', an album of 10 cover songs and two new originals, which was met with mixed reviews, some saying that it was lazy and unnecessary (""little commitment to the music here and even less enthusiasm"") whilst others appreciated the mastery he still exhibits over his craft (""winding down a legendary career with his typical class, reverence to the past and master’s touch"").

Eric Clapton is highly regarded as a premier musician, and continues to remain a force in music today.

Modest Mouse,"Modest Mouse is an alternative rock band which formed in 1993 in Issaquah, Washington, United States. The band's original lineup consisted of guitarist Isaac Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green and bassist Eric Judy. Since being signed to Sony's Epic Records in 2000, Modest Mouse has attained significant popular success with songs such as ""Float On"" and ""Dashboard.""

The band's current configuration is Isaac Brock (vocals, guitar), Tom Peloso (strings, horns, bass, keyboards), Jim Fairchild (guitar), Eric Judy (bass), Jeremiah Green (drums) and Joe Plummer (drums). Plummer has recently become the new drummer for The Shins.

Brock came up with the name ""Modest Mouse"" when he read the Virginia Woolf stream of consciousness essay The Mark On the Wall in which the author described the working middle class as ""modest mouse-coloured people""

Brock frequently moved around with his mother when he was a child. Around this time, his mother left his father for his father's brother (Brock's uncle). Brock's mother's house flooded and forced them to move into his mother's new husband's trailer, but there was no room for Brock. Brock stayed behind, living in the second story of the flooded house, until he was eventually evicted by police. He then moved into a shed next to his mother's house and it is said this is where Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green and bassist Eric Judy first began playing music.

In 1994, the band recorded their debut EP, Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?, at Calvin Johnson's Dub Narcotic Studios, which was then released on Calvin's record label K Records. Then followed a single with Sub Pop that was recorded by producer Steve Wold at Moon Studios. Wold, who in the mid-2000's would begin to perform under the name Seasick Steve, would also perform on the band's albums, but was never an official member of the band. After moving to Up Records Modest Mouse put out several releases recorded at Moon Studios, including 1996's This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About. This double LP was produced and recorded by Steve Wold. The next offering on UP was Interstate 8; also produced by Steve Wold. 1997's The Lonesome Crowded West, (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) turned out to be the band's breakthrough album. The Lonesome Crowded West gained the band a cult following and is now widely considered by many critics to be one of the defining albums of mid-90s indie rock.

In 2000, Modest Mouse released The Moon And Antarctica, their first album on a major label (Epic Records). The band enjoyed some success on alternative radio with the singles ""3rd Planet"" and ""Gravity Rides Everything."" Lead singer Isaac Brock has since put out an album with his side project Ugly Casanova on Sub Pop Records. 

In 2003, drummer Jeremiah Green quit the band; the official word was that he was quitting to work with his side project, Vells. He was replaced with two members, drummer Benjamin Weikel (who also drummed for The Helio Sequence) and guitarist Dann Gallucci (Murder City Devils).  Weikel being new to the band and Gallucci returning to the band for the first time since This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About. On April 6, 2004, Modest Mouse released the platinum-selling Good News For People Who Love Bad News, which scored two hits with ""Float On"" and ""Ocean Breathes Salty"". In 2004 Jeremiah Green returned to the band, and Benjamin Weikel now drums exclusively for The Helio Sequence. Dann Gallucci left the band in August, and they toured with Hutch Harris of The Thermals during the fall of 2004.

Modest Mouse was mentioned by name in the 2005 Supreme Court decision in the case of MGM v. Grokster. Justice Souter wrote that on the Grokster P2P network, ""Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.""

In 2005, multi-instrumentalist Tom Peloso, who already played various instruments on Good News For People Who Love Bad News, officially joined the band. In 2006,  Johnny Marr, former guitarist for The Smiths, became an official member of the band.

On March 20, 2007, the band released their fifth album, We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank. Four singles were released from the album: ""Dashboard"", ""Missed the Boat"", ""We've Got Everything"" and ""Little Motel"". The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. James Mercer of The Shins provides backing vocals on three songs.

In 2009, they released No One's First And You're Next, an EP of unreleased songs from around the time Good News and We Were Dead were recorded, and two songs that had already been released, ""I've Got It All (Most)"" and ""King Rat"". The video for King Rat was directed by late actor Heath Ledger.

In 2009, Johnny Marr left the band and was replaced by Jim Fairchild, formerly of Grandaddy. The band performed at several festivals throughout 2009 and 2010, including the main stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2010. 

After an 8 year wait, the band's latest full-length is ""Strangers To Ourselves"", released March 17th, 2015- two weeks after the original release date, March 3rd, 2015. The album art is an aerial photo of an RV resort located in Mesa, Arizona. Five singles were released before the album, ""Lampshades on Fire"", ""Coyotes"", ""The Ground Walks, with Time in a Box"", ""The Best Room"", and ""Of Course we Know"".  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Modest+Mouse"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Regina Spektor,"Regina Spektor (born Regina Ilyinichna Spektor on 18 February 1980 in Moscow) is a Russian-born American singer-songwriter and pianist. Her music is associated with the anti-folk scene centered on New York City's East Village.

Spektor studied classical piano from the age of six, practising on a Petrof piano given to her mother by her grandfather. She was also exposed to the music of rock and roll bands such as The Beatles, Queen, and The Moody Blues by her father, who obtained such recordings in Eastern Europe and traded cassettes with friends in the Soviet Union. The family left the Soviet Union in 1989, when Regina was nine, during the period of Perestroika when Jewish citizens were permitted to emigrate. The seriousness of her piano studies led her parents to consider not leaving Russia, but they finally decided to emigrate, for religious and political reasons.

Travelling first to Austria and then Italy, the family settled in the Bronx, New York, United States where Spektor graduated from a middle school yeshiva. She then attended the Frisch Yeshiva High School in Paramus, New Jersey on a scholarship for two years, but, feeling out of place, eventually transferred to a secular public school, Fair Lawn High School, in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, where she finished the last two years of her high school career
.
In New York, Spektor gained a firm grounding in classical music from her piano teacher, Sonia Vargas, a professor at the Manhattan School of Music. Spektor studied with Vargas—whom Spektor's father had met through violinist Samuel Marder, Vargas's husband—until she was 17. Although the family had been unable to bring their piano with them from Russia, Spektor found a piano on which to practice in the basement of her synagogue, also utilizing tabletops and other hard surfaces for this purpose.

Although she had always made up songs around the house, Spektor first became interested in songwriting during a visit to Israel with the Nesiya Institute in her teenage years. Attracting attention from the other children on the trip for the songs she made up while hiking, she realized she had an aptitude for songwriting. Following this trip, she was first exposed to the work of Joni Mitchell, Ani DiFranco, and other singer-songwriters, which gave her the idea that she could create her own songs. She began writing her first a cappella songs around age 16, and wrote her first songs for voice and piano when she was nearly eighteen.

Spektor completed the four-year studio composition program of the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College in Purchase, New York, including one year's study in London, at the University of Middlesex - graduating with honours in 2001. Around this time, she also worked briefly at a butterfly farm in Luck, Wisconsin. She gradually achieved recognition through performances in the anti-folk scene in downtown New York City, most importantly at the East Village's Sidewalk Cafe, but also at the Living Room, Tonic, Fez, the Knitting Factory, and CB's Gallery. During this period, she sold her self-produced CDs 11:11 (2001) and Songs (2002) at such performances.

The All The Rowboats Songfacts states that What We Saw From The Cheap Seats, Spektor's sixth album, was recorded by the singer with Mike Elizondo in Los Angeles during the summer of 2011. It was released on May 29, 2012. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Regina+Spektor"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Nina Simone,"Eunice Kathleen Waymon (21 February 1933 – 21 April 2003), better known by her stage name Nina Simone, was an American singer-songwriter, pianist, arranger, and civil rights activist widely associated with jazz music. Simone aspired to become a classical pianist while working in a broad range of styles including classical, jazz, blues, soul, folk, rhythm and blues, gospel, and pop.

Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon on 21st February 1933 in Tryon, North Carolina, USA, one of eight children. Like a number of other black singers in the U.S., she was inspired as a child by Marian Anderson, and began singing at her local church, also showing great talent as a pianist. Her public debut, a piano recital, was made at the age of ten. Her parents, who had taken seats in the front row, were forced to move to the back of the hall to make way for white audience members. This incident contributed to her later involvement in the civil rights movement.

Simone's mother, Mary Kate Waymon (who lived into her late nineties) was a strict Methodist minister; her father, John Divine Waymon, was a handyman and sometime barber who suffered bouts of ill-health. Mrs Waymon worked as a maid, and her employer, hearing of Nina's talent, provided funds for piano lessons for the little girl. Subsequently, a local fund was set up to assist in Eunice's continued education.

At seventeen, Simone moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she taught piano and accompanied singers. She was able to begin studying piano at New York City's prestigious Juilliard School of Music but lack of funds meant that she was unable to fulfill her dream of becoming America's first Black classical pianist. She later had an interview to study piano at the Curtis Institute, but was rejected. Simone believed this rejection, which fueled her hatred of racism, was because she was black.

Simone turned to blues and jazz after getting her start at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City, taking the name Nina Simone in 1954; ""Nina"" was her boyfriend's nickname for her, and ""Simone"" was after the French actress Simone Signoret. She first came to public notice in 1959 with her wrenching rendition of George Gershwin's ""I Loves You Porgy"" (from Porgy and Bess), her only Top-Forty hit in the United States. This was soon followed by the single ""My Baby Just Cares for Me"" (this was also a hit in the 1980s in the United Kingdom when used for television advertisements for Chanel No 5 perfume).

Throughout the 1960s, Simone was involved in the civil rights movement and recorded a number of political songs, including ""To Be Young, Gifted and Black"" (later covered by Aretha Franklin and Donny Hathaway), ""Backlash Blues"", ""Mississippi Goddam"" (a response to the murder of Medgar Evers and the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama killing four black children), ""I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free"", and Kurt Weill's ""Pirate Jenny"", from The Threepenny Opera, re-cast in a southern town.

In 1961, Simone recorded a version of the traditional song ""House of the Rising Sun"", which was then covered by folk-blues artist, Dave Van Ronk, and later recorded by Bob Dylan, where it was picked up by The Animals and became their signature hit. Other songs she is famous for include ""I Put a Spell on You"" (originally by Screamin' Jay Hawkins), The Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"", ""Four Women"", Bob Dylan's ""I Shall Be Released"", the Bee Gees' ""To Love Somebody"", and ""Ain't Got No (I Got Life)"". The latter, from the musical Hair, was her debut in the UK charts, reaching number two in 1968, and a remixed version of the recording by Groovefinder was a UK Top Thirty hit in 2006.

Broadway musicals also supplied several hits for Simone: ""My Baby Just Cares for Me"", ""Love Me or Leave Me"", ""Feeling Good"", and ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"". Also ""You Can Have Him"" on the LP Live at Town Hall recorded when she was twenty-six years old; at the end of this operatic performance, which displays her great skill as an actress as well as a musician, she whoops with joy. This single recording encapsulates her extraordinary power, wit, flexibility, sensuality and occasional menace.

In 1987 Nina experienced a resurgence in popularity when ""My Baby Just Cares for Me"", a track from her first Bethlehem Records album (1958) became a huge hit in the UK and elsewhere. Nina's versatility as an artist was evident in all her music, which often had a folk-music simplicity.

In a single concert, she moved easily from gospel-inspired tunes to blues and jazz and, in numbers like ""For All We Know"", to numbers infused with European classical stylings, and counterpoint fugues.

Throughout most of her career she was accompanied by percussionist Leopoldo Flemming and guitarist and musical director Al Shackman.

In 1971, Simone left the United States following disagreements with her agents, record labels, and the tax authorities, citing racism as the reason. She returned in 1978 and was arrested for tax evasion (she had withheld several years of income tax as a protest against the Vietnam War). She lived in various countries in the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe, continuing to perform into her 60s. In the 1980s, she performed regularly at Ronnie Scott's jazz club in London. In 1995, Simone reportedly shot and wounded her neighbour's son with an air pistol after his laughing disturbed her concentration.

She had a reputation in the music industry for being volatile and sometimes difficult to deal with, a characterization with which Simone strenuously took issue.

Though her onstage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly seemed to enjoy engaging her adoring audiences by recounting sometimes humorous anecdotes related to her career and music and soliciting requests. Simone's regal bearing and commanding stage presence earned her the title the ""High Priestess of Soul.""

In 1993, she settled near Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. She had been ill with cancer for several years before she died on 21st April 2003 in her sleep at her home in Carry-le-Rouet.

Simone was the recipient of a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2000 for her song ""I Loves You Porgy."" She has also received fifteen Grammy Award nominations. On Human Kindness Day 1974 in Washington, D.C., more than 10,000 people paid tribute to Simone. Simone received two honorary degrees in music and humanities, from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Malcolm X College. She preferred to be called ""Dr. Nina Simone"" after these honors were bestowed upon her. Only two days before her death, Simone was awarded an honorary degree by the Curtis Institute, the music school that had refused to admit her as a student at the beginning of her career.
In 2002, the city of Nijmegen (The Netherlands) named a street after her, the Nina Simonestraat. Simone lived in Nijmegen between 1988 and 1990.
Simone was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.
In 2010 a statue in her honor was erected in Trade Street, Tryon, North Carolina, her place of birth.

Rammstein,"Rammstein is a German metal band which was formed in 1994, in Berlin, and consists of Till Lindemann (lead vocals), Richard Kruspe (lead guitar and backing vocals), Paul Landers (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Oliver Riedel (bass guitar, ""Ollie""), Christoph Schneider (drums and Electronic percussion, ""Doom"") and Christian Lorenz (keyboards, ""Flake""). The band is widely accepted as part of the Neue Deutsche Härte scene, alongside bands such as Oomph!, Laibach, and Die Krupps. Their songs are performed almost exclusively in German. They have sold over 22 million records worldwide. Rammstein's entire catalogue is published by Universal Music Group. Since its formation, Rammstein has had no changes in lineup.
Although the majority of their songs are written in German, Rammstein has had success across the world. 

Name

Rammstein takes its name indirectly from the West German town of Ramstein-Miesenbach, the site of the flight show disaster on August 28, 1988. The band's signature song, the eponymous Rammstein, is a commemoration of the tragedy that took place at the Ramstein Air Base. The extra ""m"" in the band's name makes it translate literally as ""ramming stone"" to convey the Teutonic sound of their music. In a short period before the band became well known, they performed using the name ""Rammstein-Flugschau"" (literally meaning Rammstein-Airshow.)

Formation

Rammstein was founded by guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe. In 1989, he escaped to West Berlin and started the band, Orgasm Death Gimmick. At that time, he was heavily influenced by American music, especially that of Kiss. After the Berlin Wall came down, he moved back home to Schwerin where Till Lindemann worked as a basket weaver and played drums in the band First Arsch (loosely translated as ""Apex Ass""). At this time, Richard lived with Oliver Riedel, of the band The Inchtabokatables, and Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider (of Die Firma). Richard realized that the music he had previously created did not properly suit him. He envisioned something that would combine machines as well as the sound of hard guitars. The three started working together on a new project. Richard soon found it extremely difficult to write both music and lyrics at the same time, so he persuaded Lindemann to join Rammstein. Richard first discovered Till when he overheard him singing while he was working.

Early Years (Pre-Herzeleid Era - 1994)

A contest was held in Berlin for amateur bands in 1994, the winner of which would receive the opportunity to record a four track demo CD in a professional studio. Kruspe, Schneider, Riedel, and Lindemann entered and won the contest, which sparked the attention of Paul Landers, who wanted in on the project upon hearing their demo. To complete their sound, Rammstein then attempted to recruit Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz, who had played with Paul Landers previously in Feeling B. At first, Lorenz was hesitant, but eventually agreed to join the band.

Herzeleid (1995 - 1997)

Rammstein began to record their first studio album entitled Herzeleid in March 1995 with producer Jacob Hellner. They released their first single Du riechst so gut on August 17th and later released the album on September 24th 1995. Later that same year, they toured with Clawfinger in Warsaw and Prague. Rammstein headlined a tour of their own through Germany from December 2nd to December 22nd consisting of 17 shows which helped to boost the band's popularity. They then went on several tours throughout early 1996, releasing their second single entitled Seemann on January 8th 1996.

On March 27, Rammstein performed on MTV's Hanging Out in London; their first performance in the UK. Rammstein's first major boost in popularity outside of Germany came when music director Trent Reznor chose two Rammstein songs, namely Heirate Mich and Rammstein, for David Lynch's new film, Lost Highway. The soundtrack for the movie was released in the US in the fall of 1996 and later in Europe April 1997.

Rammstein then went on to tour through Germany, Austria and Switzerland from September to October 1996, doing an anniversary concert on 27th September called '100 years of Rammstein'. Guests to the concert included Moby, Christiane Herbold (of Bobo) and The Berlin Session Orchestra, Berlin director Gert Hof was responsible for the light show.

Sehnsucht/Live aus Berlin (late 1996 - 2000)

Rammstein started recording Sehnsucht in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta.  The album was again produced by Jacob Hellner. The first single off the album, entitled Engel was released on April 1 1997 and later reached gold on May 23. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, appropriately named Engel: Fan Edition. This contained two previously unreleased songs Feuerräder and Wilder Wein. Release of the 2nd single off the album ""Sehnsucht"" was Du Hast which hit the German single charts August 1997 at number 5.

Rammstein then continued touring in the summer whilst Sehnsucht was released on August 22nd 1997. The album reached number 1 after only two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, Herzeleid and both the singles off Sehnsucht (Du Hast and Engel) were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold out shows throughout Europe in September, October and November 1997 before releasing their cover of the Kraftwerk song, Das Modell. The single included another unreleased song entitled Kokain. On December 5th 1997, Rammstein embarked on their first tour of the United States, with support from KMFDM. On August 22nd and 23rd 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin; the biggest show the band have ever played there up to that date. Supporting acts were Danzig, Nina Hagen, Joachim Witt and Alaska. The show was professionally videotaped, intended to be released on their upcoming live DVD, Live aus Berlin. Rammstein embarked on a live tour with Korn, Ice Cube, Orgy and Limp Bizkit called the Family Values tour in September through to late October 1998. To further continue their success in the US, Sehnsucht received Gold record status on November 2nd. The Band was nominated at the MTV European Music Awards for Best Rock Act and performed Du Hast live on November 12th of that year.

Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting off the year in February with a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 42nd-annual Grammy Awards. A year after it was filmed, the Live aus Berlin concert was released on CD on 30th August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, Live aus Berlin went to number one in the German Album Charts. On September 13th and November 26th 1999 the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively.

Mutter (2000 - 2002)

Rammstein's album Mutter recording took place in the south of France between May 2000 and June 2000, and was later mixed in Stockholm in October of that year. During the Christmas holidays 2000, Rammstein released an MP3 of Links 2 3 4 as a taster for their new album. 2001 was a busy year for Rammstein, starting out in January and February with the band playing the Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand. January also heralded the shooting of the video for their upcoming single Sonne, recorded in Potsdam at Babelsberger Filmstudios from 13th to the 15th. The video was released on 29th January 2001. The single for Sonne was released on February 12th 2001 in Europe, featuring an Instrumental version of the song, two remixes by Clawfinger, and Adios off the upcoming album. Mutter was released on April 2nd 2001, sparking another Rammstein tour through Germany, Austria and Switzerland. On May 14th, the second single off the album Links 2 3 4 was released, along with a video of the single on May 18th. After a tour throughout Europe in June, the band then toured USA, Canada and Mexico from June 2001 to August 2001. Ich Will, the third single from the album was released on September 10th 2001 and a Tour edition of the Mutter album was released, featuring alternative artwork and live versions of Ich Will, Links 2 3 4, Sonne, and Spieluhr. Between January 8th and January 12th 2002, Rammstein travelled to Prague to participate in a minor scene from the movie 'xXx'. The band is seen in the opening scene of the action movie performing a concert with their song Feuer frei!. Feuer frei! was released across Europe as first single from the xXx Soundtrack on 14th October 2002. Rammstein released two remixes of the song, Furthermore, the single's tracklisting included Du Hast and Bück Dich cover versions by Battery. The single cover was an artwork by New York artist Robert Longo. The video for the single was cut by Rob Cohen, which is partly the Rammstein performance at the beginning of the movie and partly snippets from the movie itself.

Reise, Reise (2003 - 2005)

Rammstein recorded Reise, Reise at the El Cortijo studio in southern Spain between November 2003 and December 2003, it was later mixed at Toytown studio in Stockholm, Sweden in April and May 2004. The first single off of the album was Mein Teil, released on 26th July 2004. The shooting for the video is shot in the Arena, in the Treptow district of Berlin. Outdoor shooting takes place at the Deutsche Oper (Opera House) U-Bahn station on Bismarckstrasse. The director is Zoran Bihac, who was also behind the Links 2 3 4 video. The Amerika video is filmed on the 6th and 7th of August 2004 in the ruins of the former chemical factory in Rüdersdorf near Berlin, Germany under the direction of Jörn Heitmann (who also directed the Ich will video, among others). The spacesuits for the moon scenes were borrowed from Hollywood and 240 tons of ash was needed to create the moon landscape. The video premiered on 20th August 2004.

The second single from Reise, Reise was Amerika, released on September 13th 2004. With the album released on September 27th, it went straight to top 10 charts throughout Europe. According to the Billboard charts, Rammstein were now the most successful German-language band of all time. Rammstein then toured Germany through November and some of December 2004, releasing the single Ohne Dich on 22nd November.

In February 2005, Rammstein tour Europe again. Ending on February 28, 2005, Rammstein will have played 21 concerts in front of more than 200,000 spectators in 10 countries. Keine Lust was the fourth single released from Reise, Reise on 28th February 2005. From May 27th 2005 to July 30th 2005, Rammstein play festivals all around Europe and in Russia. Footage from these concerts eventually end up on Rammstein's live DVD Völkerball, released later in November 2006.

Rosenrot/Völkerball (2005 - 2006)

In August 2005, Rammstein revealed the name of their latest studio album, Rosenrot. Their first single from the new album, Benzin, was released on October 5th 2005, with its video premiere on 16th September 2005. The album Rosenrot was released worldwide on October 28th 2005. Directly following the release, the album continues the success-story of forerunner Reise, Reise and takes the top 10 charts in 20 different countries. December 16th 2005 spelled the release of the title track on the album Rosenrot. The video for Mann Gegen Mann was released on 6th February 2006, with the single being released on March 3rd. On February 19th 2006, Rammstein had the honour of having an asteroid named after them, 110393 Rammstein. Some believe their name was chosen because of the music video for Amerika, which displayed the six members of the band floating above the moon sporting NASA's astronaut suits. On November 17th the first Rammstein Live DVD since Live aus Berlin from 1998 is released. Völkerball shows concert-performances by the band in England, France, Japan and Russia.

The limited Edition is released as a large black/white photo-book with photos by Frederic Batier, who had accompanied the band through their recent tours. The Photo-book edition contains 2 DVDs and 2 Live albums.

Liebe ist für alle da & Tour (2007–2011)

The band took a time out in 2006, and began work again in 2007. The band didn't tour during 2007 due to album production. The recording process took reportedly two years.

In July 2009, the title track ""Liebe ist für alle da"" leaked onto the internet, along with promotional materials. This has led Universal Music to take action against certain fan sites.

The single ""Pussy"" was released on September 16, 2009, especially for the adult website Visit-x. The video contains graphic scenes of male and female nudity as well as women engaging in sexual activity with the band members, although the actual sex scenes were performed by body doubles. The women featured in the video are German porn stars.

The album  Liebe ist für alle da was released October 16. On November 8, 2009 Rammstein began the first leg of the Liebe ist für alle da Tour In Lisbon, Portugal.

The video to ""Ich tu dir weh"" was released on December 21, 2009 on the adult website Visit-x, just like the video to ""Pussy"", after advertisement on the band's official German website; it depicts the band on stage in a similar configuration as the one on their 2009/10 tour. Any references to the video on the official website have since been deleted. The single has been released on January 15, 2010.

On April 23, 2010, Rammstein released their video ""Haifisch"". Unlike the video to ""Ich tu dir weh"", it contains more of a storyline rather than a performance. The single was released during May and June 2010.

As part of their European summer tour, Rammstein performed at the 2010 Rock AM Ring Festival on Friday 4th - Sunday 6 June 2010. They also headlined several shows across Europe on the Sonisphere Festival, including their first ever outdoor UK performance at Knebworth Park, performing the day before Iron Maiden. On Sunday July 18, 2010, Rammstein played in front of more than 130,000 people in Quebec City on the Plains of Abraham as the closing show for the Festival d'été de Québec. It was their first North American appearance in 9 years. The band have confirmed that their last tour dates of 2010 will be in the Americas. After several South American dates the band will perform a show at the famous Madison Square Garden in New York- their first US show in nine years, Tickets sold out within 30 minutes of being on sale. It is also confirmed that they will be playing at Big Day Out 2011 in Australia and New Zealand.

Made In Germany 1995–2011 (2011–present)
On November 11, 2011 Rammstein released the single ""Mein Land"", on December 2 the album ""Made in Germany 1995–2011"".

Style

Although Rammstein is often generalized as Neue Deutsche Härte, its music spans a variety of related styles, including industrial hard rock, heavy metal and electronic music with influences of punk rock, pop music and gothic rock, due to their use of keyboards to emulate strings, choirs or pianos. The band was influenced by Laibach, a Slovenian neo-classical and industrial group. Other influences include, Oomph!, and Ministry, but the contrast between individual songs such as Du riechst so gut, Bestrafe mich, Ohne dich and Te quiero puta! makes the band difficult to classify, though most simply refer to them as industrial metal. The band's diverse range of influence has made them appealing to tastes of all kinds, but they are chiefly renowned in industrial, electronica, and heavy metal circles.

The band has a flair for costumes of all sorts, both in live shows and in videos. In the Keine Lust video, all members of the band except Flake were dressed in fat suits. In the Amerika video, all members of the band wore space suits. Live, the band experiments even more with costumes. In the Volkerball concert, among others, Till would change constumes in between songs, dressed accordingly for each song. For example, in Mein Teil, he was dressed as a butcher, in Reise, Reise, a sailor. The rest of the band each wears their own preferred costume, but none as outlandish or themed as Till's.

Rammstein's style has tended to divide critics, some of whom have responded with memorable comments. Jam Showbiz (April 2001) described Mutter as ""music to invade Poland to."" New Zealand's Southland Times (Dec. 17, 1999) suggested that Till Lindemann's ""booming, sub-sonic voice"" would send ""the peasants fleeing into their barns and bolting their doors,"" while the New York Times (Jan. 9, 2005) commented that on the stage, ""Mr. Lindemann gave off an air of such brute masculinity and barely contained violence that it seemed that he could have reached into the crowd, snatched up a fan, and bitten off his head."" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that ""their blend of industrial noise, grinding metal guitars, and operatic vocals is staggeringly powerful."" ""We just push boundaries,"" said Till Lindemann in an interview with rock magazine Kerrang!. ""We can't help it if people don't like those boundaries being pushed.""

Lyrics

Nearly all of Rammstein's songs are in German. However, the band did record Engel (English version) (Angel), Du hast (English version) (""You have"", which is most commonly confused with ""You hate"", since 'hast' and 'hasst' sound phonetically identical. In the English version of the song, the lyric is translated to ""You hate"" for stylization purposes.), and Amerika (English version), as well as covers of the songs Stripped (Depeche Mode) and Pet Sematary (The Ramones). In addition, the songs Amerika, Stirb nicht vor mir (Don't Die Before I Do) and Moskau (""Moscow"") contain not only German verses, but also English and Russian choruses, respectively; Te quiero puta! (""I love you, whore!"") is entirely in Spanish. Oliver Riedel commented that, ""German language suits heavy metal music. French might be the language of love, but German is the language of anger"".

The lyrics of Rammstein and above all their talk by singer Till Lindemann are an essential element of music and shape the perception by fans and a wider public. This is, among other things that are often very controversial, and taboo subjects such as sadomasochism (Bück Dich, Rein Raus and Bestrafe Mich), homosexuality (Mann gegen Mann), incest (Spiel mit mir and Tier), pedophilia (Tier and Halleluja) , Necrophilia (Heirate mich), Pyromania (Benzin and Hilf mir), cannibalism (Mein Teil), the game with religious images (Asche zu Asche, Engel) having sex and violence (Wollt ihr das Bett in Flammen sehen?).

Wordplay is a fundamental component of Rammstein's lyrics. In many instances, the lyrics are phrased such that they can be interpreted in several ways. The song Du hast, for example, is a play on German marriage vows (Willst Du, bis der Tod euch scheidet, treu ihr sein für alle Tage? - ""Will you, until Death separates you, be faithful to her for the rest of your days?""). In the song, the traditional affirmative response, Ja (""Yes""), is replaced by its negation Nein (""No""). The final repetition of this line further perverts the meaning of the original vows through a minor change in the wording Willst Du, bis zum Tod der Scheide ... (Will you, until the Death of the vagina ...). The song starts, in fact, with a play on words: Du... Du hast... Du hast mich... meaning ""You have me"". This line is often mistaken for ""You hate me"", because in German, there is no clear distinction between the pronunciation of Du hasst which means ""you hate"" and Du hast which means ""you have"". The word game is later resolved as the line is completed; Du hast mich gefragt (""You [have] asked me""). Confusingly, the band did also make an English version of the song named You hate which was not translated directly from Du hast. While many arguments about 'Du Hast' are around, it is known that Rammstein used this wording to mislead and create humour in the song. It was a play with the pronunciation of words, causing many non-native speakers of German to be confused.

Live Performances

Rammstein has achieved particular fame (not to mention notoriety) for its hugely over-the-top stage show, using so many pyrotechnics that fans eventually coined the motto ""Other bands play, Rammstein burns!"" (a quip at Manowar's song ""Kings of Metal"", which states, ""other bands play, Manowar kill""). After an accident in the Arena in Berlin where some burning decoration parts fell on the audience (September 27, 1996) the band took to employing professionals to handle the pyrotechnics; Lindemann himself is now a licensed pyrotechnician who spends entire songs engulfed head-to-toe in flames. He has suffered multiple burns on his ears, his hair and his arms.

The heat is so intense that on occasion, people have been carried out of Rammstein concerts suffering from heat exhaustion, and lighting gantries have been seen glowing red-hot from repeated fireball hits. The variety of the pyrotechnics can be seen in a recent concert playlist, which includes such items as ""Lycopodium Masks"", ""Glitterburst Truss"", ""Pyrostrobes"", ""Comets"", ""Flash Trays"" and ""Mortar Hits"".

The band's costumes are equally outlandish. During the Reise, Reise tour they were wearing Lederhosen, corsets and vague military uniforms with steel helmets, while during the Mutter tour the group kept to the themes of the album artwork and descended onto the stage from a giant uterus while wearing diapers.

According to Kruspe, the on-stage wackiness is entirely deliberate (Rammstein's motto according to Schneider is: ""Do your own thing. And overdo it!""). The aim is to get people's attention and have fun at the same time: ""You have to understand that 99 percent of the people don't understand the lyrics, so you have to come up with something to keep the drama in the show. We have to do something. We like to have a show; we like to play with fire. We do have a sense of humor. We do laugh about it; we have fun... but we're not Spinal Tap. We take the music and the lyrics seriously. It's a combination of humor, theater and our East German culture, you know?""

Their onstage antics have led them to trouble as well. During their stint on the American Family Values Tour 1998, alongside acts such as rapper Ice Cube, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Orgy, the band was arrested for indecency. In one of the more infamous moments, Rammstein's vocalist, Till Lindemann engaged in simulated sodomy with the keyboardist, Christian Lorenz, during their performance of ""Bück dich"" in Worcester, Massachusetts. They were subsequently arrested and fined $25 and spent the night in jail. The band attempted to appeal the fine, but spent more in legal fees and court fees than the $25 fine.

Covers and Adaptations

Rammstein's songs have been covered by a number of other artists, These include:

    * Engel : The group Gregorian reworked Engel as a Gregorian chant for their album The Dark Side. The same song has been covered by Belgian girls choir Scala & Kolacny Brothers, resulting in a very quiet, brooding version; contrary to the original.The Chilean aggrotech/industrial metal band Vigilante also covered this song on their 2008 remix album.
    * Mein Herz brennt : The German composer Torsten Rasch has produced a classical symphonic song-cycle entitled Mein Herz brennt (""My heart burns""), based on the music of Rammstein.
    * Seemann : by Nina Hagen and Apocalyptica. This cover impressed Rammstein so much that they took Apocalyptica as co-headliner on tour with them in Spring 2005, and invited the band on stage to perform ""Ohne dich"" (""Without you"") and ""Mein Herz brennt"" (""My Heart burns"") together. The ""Benzin"" single also featured a remix of the song, called Kerosiini by Apocalyptica.
    * Ohne dich : by Laibach.
    * Weißes Fleisch : by the German death metal band Debauchery covered the song for their Back In Blood album.
    * ""Mein Teil"" : A bluegrass version appears as a bonus track on the band Hayseed Dixie's 2007 album Weapons of Grass Destruction.

Rammstein has also done several covers themselves, including Das Modell (""The model"") by Kraftwerk, ""Stripped"" by Depeche Mode and ""Pet Sematary"" by Ramones (sung by keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz). A cover version of Schtiel (""Calm"") by Aria (Ария) was released by Till Lindemann & Richard Kruspe as a side project, due to disagreement with Universal records label.

It was recently announced that the German pop singer Nena, author of 99 Luftballons (""99 Air Balloons""), will be doing an album of covers named Cover Me in which it will feature a Rammstein cover of the song Ein Lied. Till Lindemann appears as a guest singer along with Richard Kruspe on guitar on the Apocalyptica album Worlds Collide. They took on David Bowie's song Heroes, which was released in German as Helden. Lindemann sings the German version, making his song the only German-language song on Worlds Collide.

Rammstein singles traditionally also have a great quantity of remixes, particularly often from Clawfinger and Meshuggah.

Controversies

Imagery

Described by the New York Times as a ""powerful strain of brutally intense rock"" who ""bring gale-force music and spectacular theatrics together"", Rammstein has been a band with a highly controversy-prone nature. Rammstein have not been shy about courting this controversy and have periodically attracted condemnation from morality campaigners. Their stage act earned them a night in jail in June 1999 after a liquid-ejecting dildo was used in a concert in Worcester, Massachusetts. Back home in Germany, the band has faced repeated accusations of fascist sympathies due to the dark and sometimes militaristic imagery of their videos and concerts, including the use of excerpts from the film Olympia by Leni Riefenstahl in the video for Stripped. Their debut album Herzeleid, released in Germany in 1995, originally had a cover featuring the band members' upper bodies without clothing; critics accused the band of trying to sell themselves as ""poster boys for the Master Race"". Rammstein have vigorously denied this and said that they want nothing to do with politics or supremacy of any kind. Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz, annoyed by the claim, has remarked that it's just a photo, and should be understood as such. Herzeleid has since been given an alternate cover in the United States, depicting the band members' faces.

The song Links 2 3 4 (Links being German for ""left"") was written as a riposte to these claims. According to Kruspe, it means, ""'My heart beats on the left, two, three, four'. It's simple. If you want to put us in a political category, we're on the left side, and that's the reason we made the song"". On the other hand, this is also an allusion to a military marching cadence since ""Links, 2, 3, 4"" is typically heard during marching practice in the German army with ""links"" referring to the left foot. The song is also a reference to the saying ""the heart beats left"", repeatedly used by Oskar Lafontaine, in 2001 a famous member of the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany), now leader of the Left Party (Die Linke), and almost the title of a book written by him (the title is Das Herz schlägt links instead of Mein Herz schlägt links – ""The heart beats left"" instead of ""My Heart beats left"")..

According to the German online music magazine Rammstein, through this song, positioned themselves on the side of Oskar Lafontaine. They write:

    Rammstein binden den Lafontaine-Spruch ""Mein Herz schlägt links"" in ihren Text ein und zitieren eine Zeile aus einem alten Hannes Wader-Arbeitersong (""Links, zwo, drei, vier; links, zwo, drei, vier; wo dein Platz Genosse ist, reih Dich ein in die Arbeitereinheitsfront, wenn Du auch ein Arbeiter bist""). (Rammstein embed the Lafontaine saying My heart beats left into their lyric and cite a line of an old Hannes Wader workers' song (""Left, 2, 3, 4; left 2, 3, 4; where your place is comrade, line up into the Workers' United Front, if you are a worker"").)

Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz recently stated on an on-line chat that the song was created in order to show that the band could write a harsh, ""evil"", military-sounding song that was not about Nazi ideals.

Relation To Violent Events

Rammstein were cited in relation to the Columbine High School Massacre in 1999, when photos of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold wearing Rammstein T-shirts were revealed. Though there was no evidence to correlate the two events, the band felt obliged to issue a statement:

    ""The members of Rammstein express their condolences and sympathy to all affected by the recent tragic events in Denver. They wish to make it clear that they have no lyrical content or political beliefs that could have possibly influenced such behaviour. Additionally, members of Rammstein have children of their own, in whom they continually strive to instill healthy and non-violent values"".

Coincidentally, on September 10, 2001 the single and video clip of Ich will (""I Want"") was released which portrays the band as terrorists who want to get a message across and receiving a kind of terrorist award for their ""actions"". In the United States the video clip was broadcast only late at night after the attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York City although many media officials and politicians requested the video to be pulled from broadcast completely.

Following the tragic conclusion of the Beslan school hostage crisis in Russia in September 2004, the Russian authorities claimed that the terrorists had ""listened to German hard rock group Rammstein on personal stereos during the siege to keep themselves edgy and fired up"". The claim has not been independently confirmed.

Band members said this about the issue:

    ""There's been a lot of talk about that, but if there are radical feelings in people anything can wake them – a painting, a picture, whatever. It's just a coincidence that it happened to be our music. It's important to think about what caused them to make their decisions, how they became animals, not their taste in music. Whenever something like this happens it's like 'Okay, let's blame the artist'. Such bullshit. (Till Lindemann).

    ""Our music is made to release aggression, and people listening to it are also needed to do that, but it's not our fault. Should we stop making hard music because bad people might like it?"" (Christoph ""Doom"" Schneider).

Pekka-Erik Auvinen, the perpetrator of the Jokela school shooting in November 2007 also included Rammstein in one of his favourite bands. He noted though that, the music among other things was not to blame for his decisions.

Videos

In October 2004, the video for Mein Teil (""My part"") caused considerable controversy in Germany when it was released. It takes a darkly comic view of the Armin Meiwes cannibalism case, showing a cross dressed Schneider holding the other 5 band members on a leash and rolling around in mud. The controversy did nothing to stop (and may even have helped) the single rising to No. 2 in the German charts. Meiwes (who was convicted of manslaughter in 2004, then retried in 2006 and found guilty of murder) brought suit in January 2006 against the band for infringement of rights to the story. The outcome resulted in a loss for the band of $5.5 million.

The band's own views of its image are sanguine: ""We like being on the fringes of bad taste"", according to Paul H. Landers, while Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz comments ""The controversy is fun, like stealing forbidden fruit. But it serves a purpose. We like audiences to grapple with our music, and people have become more receptive"".

Not all of Rammstein's videos feature excess and pushing the limits of conventional taste. The video of Ohne Dich (""Without You"") from Reise, Reise can only be described as lushly filmed and touchingly melancholy.

The video for Mann gegen Mann (""Man against man"") from their studio album Rosenrot may have caused some controversy, as most of the band members are naked in the video. The lead singer Till Lindemann is wearing what can best be described as a ""latex panties"" - most likely because he does not have an instrument with which to cover his genitalia. In addition, there are multiple naked men in the video, with clearly visible buttocks, though genitalia could be seen at 32 seconds into the video on Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz through the arm of the guitarist (Richard Z. Krupse) and below the keyboard. He is wearing a flesh-colored thong to prevent this. The video has been played uncensored on MTV. The video has been rated FSK 16 in Germany and therefore can be played on television only after 10pm. The first single from Liebe ist für alle da, ""Pussy"", shows body doubles of the band members having sex in the uncensored version of the music video.

P!nk,"P!nk is a stylisation of Pink, a pseudonym of singer songwriter Alecia Beth Moore (b. 8 Sep 1979, in Doylestown, PA, USA), who gained prominence in early 2000.  She has sold over 16 million albums in the United States, over 43 million worldwide, and has won three Grammy awards.

P!nk began her career as an RnB artist, signed to the predominately urban label, LaFace Records. She has since complained that because she chose to relinquish creative control to her record label, she did not like the type of music she was making at that time, and did not like her image, which included bright Pink hair. Her first album, Can't Take Me Home was a substantial success, going platinum, due to the huge pop and urban radio hit singles ""There You Go""  and ""Most Girls"". 

Towards the end of 2001, P!nk decided to take her career in a new direction and have more creative control. Tired of being marketed as a another cookie-cutter pop act, and eager to become a more serious singer-songwriter and musician, P!nk sought the help of former 4 Non Blondes vocalist, Linda Perry. Together, P!nk and Perry co-wrote and co-produced most of the tracks on P!nk's sophomore album, M!ssundaztood, which was released in November 2001. The album's more pop rock sound could be heard immediately with its first single, the Linda Perry penned ""Get the Party Started"".  ""Get the Party Started"" was a huge, commercially successful single, topping the charts in many countries. The album's other singles, ""Don't Let Me Get Me"", ""Just Like A Pill"", and ""Family Portrait"" were also radio and commercial successes.

In 2003, P!nk released a new album called Try This. Eight of the thirteen tracks were co-written with Tim Armstrong of punk band Rancid. Try This reached the Top 10 on album charts in the US, Canada, UK and Australia in 2003. Though its singles ""Trouble"" and ""God Is A DJ"" didn't do as well in her home country as her previous singles, ""Trouble"" earned Pink her second Grammy award in 2003. However the singles were largely successful in the United Kingdom and Australia.

P!nk's fourth album, I'm Not Dead was released in April 2006. The first single was the controversial and funny ""Stupid Girls"". The album had started causing controversy before it was even released: the song Dear Mr. President is an open letter condemning the actions of President George W. Bush. P!nk appeared on the Australian TV show ""Rove Live"", discussing the track, stating that it would never be released as a single in the United States, lest it be misinterpreted as a publicity stunt.  A DVD containing concert footage of P!nk's Try This European tour was released in May 2006.

Her fifth album, Funhouse, was released in October 2008, preceded by her first solo number one on the Billboard Hot 100, ""So What"". The following singles from Funhouse, ""Sober"" and ""Please Don't Leave Me"", both charted well on their releases around the world.

In 2010 !nk collaborated on The Imagine Project singing Don't Give Up and Imagine. She also featured in the track Won't Back Down for Enimem's album Recovery. In October 2010 she released the first single Raise Your Glass from her first compilation album Greatest Hits... So Far!!!.

P!nk was the voice actress of Gloria in the animated movie Happy Feet Two, which premiered in the US on November 18, 2011. She also sang the movie's theme song Bridge of Light.

P!nk's sixth album The Truth About Love was first confirmed by P!nk by Twitter on February 29, 2012. The first single from this album Blow Me (One Last Kiss) was produced by Greg Kurstin and released on July 3. P!nk announced the album title the following day, along with the news of her upcoming world tour. On September 6th P!nk performed Blow Me (One Last Kiss) live at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. In February 2013 P!nk started her ""Truth About Love Tour"", which was so popular that she added additional dates for US/Canada and Australia.

During this time her track Just Give Me A Reason rose up to 9th on the Hot 100, her 14th Top 10 hit on that chart. The following week this rose up to number 5, and two weeks later it topped the Billboard Hot 100 becoming her 4th number-one single in the US. It also topped the charts in several other countries worldwide, and held the top spot on the Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks. On April 29, 2013, Just Give Me a Reason became P!nk's eighth number one on Billboard's Adult Top 40, which resulted in her becoming the record holder for most number ones on that chart, beating out Maroon 5 and Katy Perry who each have seven.

In 2013, Billboard named Pink Woman of the Year, citing the success of her album The Truth About Love and of the singles ""Blow Me (One Last Kiss)"", ""Try"", ""Just Give Me a Reason"", and ""True Love"", as well as her 2013 tour, which was extended to 140 different sets due to demand. The Truth About Love earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album earlier in 2013.

After releasing The Truth About Love in 2012, RCA Records has announced that they have signed Pink for a multi-album deal that will last for years to come. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/P%21nk"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bonobo,"Simon Green AKA Bonobo's first album - 2000's 'Animal Magic' - was released via Tru Thoughts before being picked up by Ninja Tune. It announced him as a serious talent; able to bring a musician's edge to electronic music, with all the freedom that skill allowed. His subsequent albums for Ninja, Dial M for Monkey and Days to Come, developed his sensibility, won him fans across the globe, and saw him develop his live show into a mesmeric re-working of his records. 

He has also worked hard as a DJ, a part of Green's arsenal that perhaps truly came into its own at the same time as 2010’s Black Sands. 2012 saw him take the uptempo, club re-edits of Black Sands from a seminal Boiler Room performance in London to dance floors across the world, and unveil a new light show that further enhanced the impact of these stunning songs. A remix album was released featuring reworkings by fans and peers such as Machinedrum, Floating Points, Mark Pitchard, Lapalux and Falty DL. 

Later the same year, he finally settled down in his New York studio to write his fifth album. The North Borders was another long stride forward - both a natural evolution and a continuation of the electronic palette of Black Sands. With vocal features from Erykah Badu, as well as Grey Reverend (Cinematic Orchestra) and Cornelia (Portico Quartet) it's another finely balanced body of work.

Bonobo has a long history of unearthing new talent (Andreya Triana, Bajka) and The North Borders saw him do so once again. The vocals of new collaborator Szjerdene are sprinkled across the album.

Since the album’s release, Green has gone on to play over 175 shows across three continents and 30 countries, wowing audiences with the hypnotic, extended live versions of his songs. He performed sold out shows at The Sydney Opera House and Brixton Academy, and his very own, day long festival at London’s Roundhouse. 2014 saw him and his band play the iconic Coachella festival, Sonar, Glastonbury and many more.  This period of extensive touring came to a breathtaking close with his largest show to date at London’s Alexandra Palace in November. In celebration, Ninja Tune released ‘The North Borders Tour. - Live’ in October. A deluxe release including a live album, hardback book and a DVD of seminal live performances from a truly memorable tour.

Yeah Yeah Yeahs,"Yeah Yeah Yeahs are an American indie rock/post-punk band formed in New York City, New York in the late summer of 2000 by Karen O, born Karen Lee Orzolek (vocals), Nick Zinner (guitar, keyboards) and Brian Chase (drums). The group's music melds genres ranging from art punk and garage rock to electronic and new wave. Karen O is known for her screaming, bluesy vocals and energetic stage presence, complemented by her outrageously colorful costumes.

Karen O and Brian Chase first met as students at Oberlin College in Ohio in the late 90s, where Chase was a jazz student at the conservatory. Karen then transferred to New York University, and while in New York met Zinner in a local bar, where they formed an ""instant connection"". During this time they also shared a loft in Manhattan with future members of the band Metric. 

The two formed an acoustic duo called Unitard, but they went electric after being inspired by Ohio's avant-punk scene. After the drummer they recruited initially bowed out, Chase joined the line-up and decided to form a punk band similar to the ""trashy, punky, grimy"" art student groups that Karen had left behind in Ohio. The newly band named Yeah Yeah Yeahs wrote a slew of songs at their first rehearsal and soon wound up supporting The Strokes and The White Stripes, earning a significant buzz for their arty and garage punk scene.

In 9 July 2001, the band released their debut EP Yeah Yeah Yeahs, which they recorded with Boss Hog's Jerry Teel, on their own Shifty label. In 5 November 2002, they released the second EP entitled Machine on Touch and Go label.

In 29 April 2003, Yeah Yeah Yeahs released their debut album Fever To Tell on Interscope. This album peaked at #13 on UK albums chart, #55 on Billboard 200 and also received critical acclaim. Fever To Tell was produced by David Sitek (of TV on the Radio) and the band. Four singles were released from this album: ""Date with the Night"" (14 April 2003 in UK and 21 April 2003 in US; #16 UK), ""Pin"" (22 July 2003; #29 UK), ""Maps"" (10 February 2004; #26 UK) and ""Y Control"" (1 June 2004; #54 UK). ""Maps"" received significant airplay on alternative radio and it's considered their signature song.

Fever To Tell was nominated for a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album and was certified Gold in the UK. The New York Times chose Fever To Tell as the best album of the year. In June 2005, the album was ranked number 89 on Spin magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005. It is also featured in the book ""1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die"". In 2009, the album was declared by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork Media, and NME, the 28th, 24th, and 5th best album of the decade, respectively.

In October 2004, the group issued the DVD, ""Tell Me What Rockers to Swallow"" which included a concert filmed at The Fillmore in San Francisco, all of the band's music videos to date, and various interviews. In 2005, Karen O collaborated with Kool Keith on the track ""Teaser"". For the movie ""Jackass 2"", she collaborated with Peaches and Johnny Knoxville to record a track entitled ""Backass"". Nick Zinner also plays in Head Wound City, a hardcore supergroup with members of the Blood Brothers and The Locust, and has toured with Bright Eyes for his album, Digital Ash in a Digital Urn.

Show Your Bones was named the second best album of the year by NME magazine, as well as ""Cheated Hearts"" being voted the 10th best song. Rolling Stone magazine named this album as being the 44th best album of 2006, while Spin magazine ranked it # 31 on their Top 40 Best Albums of 2006. The album was also nominated for a 2007 Grammy Award for ""Best Alternative Music Album"". In 2009 Show Your Bones ranked #32 on NME Top 100 Albums of the Decade.

In 24 July 2007, Yeah Yeah Yeahs released their third EP, titled Is Is EP. This EP includes 5 songs written in 2004 during the Fever to Tell tour, including the single ""Down Boy"". The band also made a live film to accompany the EP, recorded at the Glasslands Gallery in Brooklyn, NY.

Phoenix (2)
A Romanian folk rock / rock band, who has experimented across the years with many musical genres, having a rich musical history that can easily be compared to that of the Beatles. Starting with the rock’n’roll of the Beat Generation, they continued enriching their sound with blues influences, jazz, psychedelic, krautrock, culminating with the orientation towards Romanian folk music, which they blended harmoniously with the sound that was popular in the ’70s

Phoenix is one of the most prominent Romanian Rock and Roll bands of the latest decades, and also the first one to take musical inspiration from ancient Romanian folk themes.

Formed in the 1960s, it began by doing covers of Beatles songs. However, they soon had to change their style since the Romanian communist regime disliked any form of western culture. The communist regime suggested that all rock oriented bands should look for inspiration within the Romanian culture. These restrictions made the band’s leader Nicolae Covaci search within the Romanian folklore, which gave them a unique sound.

The beginning

Phoenix was launched in the cosmopolitan city of Timişoara in 1962 by a pair of schoolboys: Nicu Covaci and Béla Kamocsa, under the name of Sfinţii (The Saints). In their first years, together with Florin “Moni” Bordeianu (born 1948), they performed in school contests and at local clubs, covering Western music hits from The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Who, etc., and they quickly became very popular amongst the youth. In 1965 the Communist authorities demanded that the band stop performing under the name The Saints, because of the religious innuendo that the name carried. Forced to comply, the band took the name Phoenix. Nicu Covaci also changed the composition of the band, around 1963, by adding Claudiu Rotaru, Ioan “Pilu” Ştefanovici (born 1946) and Günther “Spitzly” Reininger (born 1950) to the lineup.

In 1965 they had their first big concert in Bucharest. Their performance brought a collaboration with Cornel Chiriac to record some of their songs. The first songs they recorded were “Ştiu cǎ mǎ iubesti şi tu” (“I Know You Love Me Too”), “Dunăre, Dunăre” (“Danube, Danube”) and “Bun e vinul ghiurghiuliu” (“Good is the Red Wine”). The same year also marked the beginning of their collaboration with Victor Cârcu, who went on to write many of their most famous songs, such as “Vremuri” (“Old Times”), “Şi totuşi ca voi sunt” (“And Yet I Am Like You”), “Nebunul cu ochii închişi” (“Crazy Man with closed eyes”), “Floarea stîncilor” (“Mountain Flower”) and “Canarul” (“Canary”).

In December 1967 Phoenix had their first major series of concerts in many western cities, capped off by two huge concerts in Timişoara. After winning a few prizes in national students’ contests, held at Iaşi the following year, in 1968 they recorded their first EP, Vremuri (Old Times), containing two original songs, Vremuri and Canarul (The Canary), and two covers (Lady Madonna - The Beatles and Friday on my Mind - Easybeats). A second EP would follow one year later, named Floarea stîncilor (The Flower of the Rocks), with all four songs being original compositions. Both albums sport a sound reminiscent of the beat style popular in that era.

They then started working on a rock theater play “Omul 36/80” (The Man 36/80) which won several prizes for originality.

In 1969 Ioan “Pilu” Ştefanovici was replaced by Dorel “Baba” Vintilă Zaharia (born 1943). For the next year the band became more and more popular, frequently visiting Bucharest and being invited in talk shows about music.

In 1970, Moni Bordeianu emigrated to the US, and, for a brief period of time the band suspended its activity, also due to total censorship that followed a protesting speech held by Bordeianu in his last concert. 1970 meant the blues period of the band. The formula used was Nicu Covaci - guitar, Günther “Spitzly” Reininger - piano and voice, Zoltan Covacs - bass guitar and Liviu Butoi - oboe and flute. Phoenix was born again the next year, with Covaci, Josef Kappl, Mircea Baniciu, Costin Petrescu (replaced in 1974 by Ovidiu Lipan, nicknamed “Ţăndărică”) and Valeriu Sepi.

But the Communist officials were not very comfortable with the Western-style music that they were singing, and kept creating them problems. So Phoenix abandoned beat turned to Romanian folklore, pagan rituals, mystic animals and old traditions. In this same year, Phoenix started a collaboration with the Institute of Ethnography and Folklore and the Folklore section of Timişoara University on an ambitious project, a rock poem that combined traditional wooden instruments with modern sounds. During this project the band also started collaborating with Valeriu Sepi (born 1947), who eventually joined the band. The first outcome would be the 1972 LP Cei ce ne-au dat nume (Those Who Gave Us Our Names) - the first LP to be recorded in Romania by a Romanian band. Two years later, Mugur de fluier (Flute Bud) followed. Both albums underwent severe censorship.

In 1973 Phoenix represented Romania at the “Golden harp” festival in Bratislava (Slovakia) and then in the “Disc festival” in Sopot (Poland). Also, they wanted to record a new rock-opera, named “Meşterul Manole”, but the communist officials censored it all, by “losing” the unique book with costume sketches and lyrics given to them for official approval. The result was only a EP with an extract from the opera, Meşterul Manole, uvertură (Meşterul Manole, uverture) and two older songs, Mamă, Mamă (Mother, Mother) and Te întreb pe tine, soare… (I’m asking you, sun…).

On Monday, 19 November 1973, Phoenix held a memorable concert in Bucharest, presenting their new hits “Andri Popa”, “Pavel Chinezu” and “Strunga”, which composed the new disc “Mugur de fluier”. The new songs were still influenced by folklore yet had a new style. This style was the result of the collaboration with new songwriters Andrei Ujică and Şerban Foarţă. Based on those new songs Nicu Covaci created a new show “Introducere la un concert despre muzica veche la români” (“Introduction to a concert about old Romanian music”) in which he introduced violins, flutes, archaic percussion and other traditional instruments. The show was never finished due to a new collaboration with “Cenaclul Flacăra.” This period is considered the peak for Phoenix. Their sound was considered original and powerful and full stadiums were common for their concerts.

Every winter the members of the band would retreat to Mount Semenic and plan their upcoming songs. That winter the show “Zoosophia”, a title that would later change to “Cantafabule”, was created. The show began by “calling” all mythic animals and continued by dedicating a song to each of them, finishing with the Phoenix, the band’s symbol. The year 1975 brought a newcomer to the band, Ovidiu Lipan “Ţăndărică” (born 1953). The “Cantafabule” show was first presented in Timişoara in February 1975. The disc was recorded in a very short time and was published the same year with a misspelling in the title: “Cantofabule.” What followed were two years of almost continuous concerts but also the creation of the soundtrack for the movie “Nemuritorii”.

By this time, the popularity of Phoenix had grown huge; people loved their songs not only for what they were, but also because they contained thinly-veiled allusions to the Communist regime. The band members, especially Nicu Covaci, found themselves increasingly harassed by the Securitate. Covaci married a Dutch woman and left the country in 1976. He returned in 1977, bringing in relief aid for those struck by the powerful earthquake on March 4. After two grandiose concerts in Constanţa and Tulcea, Covaci surprisingly left the country again, this time with all the band members (except Baniciu) hidden inside their Marshall speakers - a huge undertaking, since in Communist Romania it was extremely difficult to obtain approval to travel abroad, and illegal border crossing was punished with imprisonment.

After arriving in Germany, Phoenix disbanded. Kappl and a few others (Erlend Krauser, Ovidiu Lipan) formed a new band, Madhouse and released a not very successful album named From The East. In 1981, Covaci co-opted Neumann and Lipan and English bassist Tom Buggie, who had an amazing technical playing ability, under the name Transsylvania Phoenix (since a band named Phoenix already existed) and released an LP named Transsylvania, containing two old Phoenix songs translated into English to target the Western audience and five new ones. Covaci together with Kappl also released two EPs and one maxi single as Transsylvania-Phoenix.

In 1990 Phoenix made a triumphant comeback to Romania, with a highly emotional concert in their hometown Timişoara, the city that sparked the popular revolt in December 1989 that eventually led to the downfall of the Communist regime. In the following years, Phoenix toured a lot and released a few compilations of their older recordings. Internal frictions, especially between Covaci and Baniciu, were making headlines in the media.

A new album appeared in 2000, the first original album after their 1990 comeback; with the exception of Covaci, the lineup comprised none of the members from the ’70s.

In 2002, the 40th Anniversary of the band brought together almost all former members in a supershow.

At the end of 2005 the band (in its classic gold lineup) released a new album, named Baba Novak.

As of 2010, the band still performs at live events.

John Mayer,"There are two artists with the name John Mayer; American pop singer-songwriter John Clayton Mayer (b. 1977), and Anglo-Indian Composer John Jiddhu Mayer (1930 - 2004) and leader of John Mayer's Indo Jazz Fusions

1) John Clayton Mayer was born October 16, 1977, in Fairfield, Connecticut, USA, and started playing guitar at 13 after being inspired by a Stevie Ray Vaughan tape his neighbor gave him. In 1998 he moved to Atlanta, Georgia where he refined his skills and gained a following.

In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the 2002 single ""Your Body Is a Wonderland"" from the album Room for Squares.

In February 2005, he was awarded the Song of the Year Grammy for his song Daughters, which he composed while in the shower, from the album Heavier Things. In winning the award, he beat out such contenders as Alicia Keys, and Kanye West. He dedicated this award to his grandmother, Annie Hoffman, who died in May 2004. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, for which Elvis Costello, Prince and Seal were also nominated. In 2007, John won 2 Grammys, one for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, for the song ""Waiting On The World To Change,"" and also Best Pop Vocal Album for his album Continuum.

To date, Mayer has toured with many groups, including Maroon 5, Guster, Counting Crows, The Wallflowers, Teitur, Ben Folds, and Sheryl Crow.

In 2004, Mayer worked with hip hop artist and producer Kanye West, appearing both on Go and Kanye West's Bittersweet (released in the summer of 2007 as an iTunes pre-order bonus track to the album Graduation) and received praise from rap heavyweights like Jay-Z and Nelly. When asked about his ubiquitous presence in the hip hop community, he said, ""It's not music out there right now. That's why, to me, hip-hop is where rock used to be.""

It was around this time that he began hinting at a change in his musical interests, announcing that he was ""closing up shop on acoustic sensitivity."" In 2005, he began a string of collaborations with various blues artists, including Buddy Guy, BB King, Eric Clapton and jazz artist John Scofield. He also toured with the legendary jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, which included a show at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee.

Although Mayer has maintained a reputation for being a sensitive singer-songwriter, he is also an accomplished guitarist influenced by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Freddie King and B.B. King.  In this regard, he has released an album with his band The John Mayer Trio Try!, which features a blues-rock style reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix.

In September 2006, Mayer released his third studio album, Continuum.  The album, written and produced exclusively by Mayer (with the help of Steve Jordan from the John Mayer Trio) is a culmination of Mayer's growth as an artist and continues with the blues-rock style that he began to flirt with on Try!.

Also notable is John Mayer's various adaptations in style. He always maintained a blues tone, he introduced a rockier edge. However, in Continuum, he adopts a calmer genre, returning to his previous styles. 

On November 17, 2009, Mayer's fourth studio album, Battle Studies, was released and debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart. The album consists of 11 tracks with a total time of 45 minutes. The first single from the album, ""Who Says"", was released on September 24, 2009 in advance of album, and was followed on October 19 by the single ""Heartbreak Warfare"" and the single ""Half of My Heart"" released on June 21, 2010. Despite the album's commercial success, critics were mixed with their praise; while some reviews were glowing, calling it his ""most adventurous"", others called the album ""safe"" and noted that ""Mayer the singer-songwriter and Mayer the man about town sometimes seem disconnected, like they don't even belong in the same body.

Following his recovery from vocal surgery, Mayer returned to the studio. On June 18, 2013, Mayer announced from his Facebook page that his sixth album, Paradise Valley, would be released on August 13, 2013. On the same day, he released a lyric video for the new album's first single, ""Paper Doll"", on his YouTube page. The release date was later changed to August 20, 2013. ""Who You Love"" featuring Katy Perry followed as the album's third single and a music video was released on December 17, 2013 for the song. The album, which also includes a collaboration with Frank Ocean, was met with positive reviews from music critics. Mayer embarked on a tour, his first in three years, in support of Born and Raised and Paradise Valley. The American leg of the tour ran from July to December 2013 with Interscope recording artist Phillip Phillips serving as support act. The tour will visit Australia in April 2014.



2) John Jiddhu Mayer (b. Calcutta, Bengal, British India, October 28, 1930; d. United Kingdom, March 9, 2004) was an Indian composer known primarily for his fusions of jazz with Indian music. He was born into an Anglo-Indian family and, after studying with Phillipe Sandre in Calcutta and Melhi Mehta in Bombay, he won a scholarship to London's Royal Academy of Music in 1952, where he studied comparative music and religion in eastern and western cultures.

He worked as a violinist with the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1953-58) and then with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (1958-65), but was also composing fusions of Hindustani classical and Western classical forms from 1952 onwards. His Violin Sonata was performed by Yehudi Menuhin in 1955.
In the 1960s he worked extensively with the Jamaican jazz musician Joe Harriott, with whom he formed the group Indo-Jazz Fusions, a ten-piece featuring a jazz quintet and five Indian musicians. The new incarnation of the band, called John Mayer's Indo Jazz Fusions, was revived in the 1990s and continued to play live gigs -- featuring Mayer's son Jonathan Mayer on sitar -- until John Mayer's death.

From 1996 onwards, Mayer, though based in north London, worked part-time as composer-in-residence at the Birmingham Conservatoire where he introduced the BMus Indian music course in 1997.

Albums include Indo-Jazz Fusions I & II, Dhammapada, Etudes & Radha Krishna, and Asian Airs.

Lissack and singer/guitarist Kele Okereke first met in 1998 in Essex, where Lissack had grown up and Okereke attended school. Lissack attended Bancroft's School and Okereke attended Ilford County High School until 16 then Trinity School for sixth form. They bumped into each other again in 1999 at the Reading Festival and soon after formed the band Union.

In 2003 they changed their name from Union to Bloc Party. The name is a play on block party, a name for an informal neighbourhood festival, which might hire a local band as entertainment. The band have said that the name was not intended to be an allusion to the Soviet Bloc or the Canadian political party Bloc Québécois; the absence of a 'k' is purely for aesthetics.

However, the band's bassist, Gordon Moakes, said on the group's official internet forum that it was more a merging of the eastern ""blocs"" and the western ""parties"", in the political sense. Moakes notes that the name was not driven by politics, but rather it ""looked, sounded, seemed fine so we went with it.""

In November 2003, Bloc Party had their track ""The Marshalls Are Dead"" featured on a compilation CD called The New Cross released by Angular Recording Corporation. Soon after they released their debut sngle ""She's Hearing Voices"" on the then fledgling record label Trash Aesthetics.

The band got their break after Okereke went to a Franz Ferdinand concert in 2003, and was able to thrust a copy of the single into the hands of both Franz lead singer Alex Kapranos and Radio One DJ Steve Lamacq. Lamacq subsequently played the song on his radio show, labeling the track ""genius"", and invited them to record a live session for the show.

The buzz generated off the back of the single sparked some A&R interest, leading to another single ""Banquet"", this time released by the label Moshi Moshi, and to the eventual signing with indie label Wichita Recordings in April 2004.

Bloc Party's own variation of spiky guitar rock draws on influences such as The Cure, Gang of Four, The Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, Pixies, Joy Division, and XTC, but the band says that some of these bands are just comparisons. Does that last bit even mean anything?

The drumming on Bloc Party songs is often influenced by the London dance and R&B scene whilst the guitar demonstrates typical indie sharpness with alternative panned chords and fast chord picking. To achieve their unique guitar style, BOSS echo effects equipment is implemented and is particularly apparent on the track ""Like Eating Glass"".

The musical style of A Weekend in the City is more varied, however, drawing influence particularly from more expansive sounding bands, including Radiohead. As large as Bloc Party has been over recent years, they are still in their youth. They have developed unique songs and sounds, but they are still trying to find their own personality. The song ""Flux"" was released at the end of 2007 as an add-on to A Weekend in the City. The band is coming to terms with its growth and development, and should find itself with its next album.


Silent Alarm (2004–2006)

Their debut album Silent Alarm, released in February 2005, was met with critical acclaim and broke sales records, being voted by NME critics as the 2005 album of the year and reaching #3 on UK album charts (selling platinum in the UK). The second single from the album ""So Here We Are"" made the top 5 on UK charts. Further singles ""Banquet"" (which reached #13 in NME's ""Top 50 singles of 2005""), ""Helicopter"" (which featured on the FIFA 06, Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure, Project Gotham Racing 3, Burnout Revenge and Guitar Hero III game soundtracks) and ""Pioneers"" (July 2005), whilst failing to repeat this success, managed to make dents in the UK top 20. The animated video for the single ""Pioneers"" was number one in the NME video charts for 4 weeks and was made for a tiny budget in four weeks by the Shoreditch based Mini Vegas design agency.

Even though the band was met with good reviews from critics in America, Bloc Party failed to break through to the pop or rock charts in the US.

Bloc Party became one of the most popular new bands of 2005, and the established electronic group The Chemical Brothers soon collaborated with Okereke for ""Believe"", a track on the Brothers' Push the Button album.

An album of remixes of tracks from Silent Alarm was released at the end of August in the UK. This remix album, Silent Alarm Remixed, retained the album's original track list and includes remixes from the likes of Ladytron, M83, Death from Above 1979, Four Tet and Mogwai.

During July, they recorded two new tracks (titles were given of ""Hero"" and ""Two More Years"") with Silent Alarm producer Paul Epworth. The latter, ""Two More Years"" was released on October 3 to coincide with their October 2005 UK tour. The songs were released as an EP titled Two More Years, accompanied with a re-release of Silent Alarm, which included ""Two More Years"" itself along with former single ""Little Thoughts"". The single format of ""Two More Years"" contained a remix of ""Banquet"" done by The Streets, for which a video was also recorded.

The band also contributed the track ""The Present"" to the Help: a Day in the Life compilation, the profits of which benefits the War Child charity.

The single ""Banquet"" was sampled in 2006 by DJ Green Lantern for a track with Apathy, Tak (of rap duo Styles of Beyond) and Mike Shinoda. The track, entitled ""Bloc Party"", appears on Green Lantern's Fort Minor: We Major mixtape.

The band released their second album, called A Weekend in the City on February 5, 2007 in the UK and February 6 in the United States. The album debuted at #12 in the Billboard 200 with 48,000 copies sold. It became available via the UK's iTunes store a day ahead of schedule, on February 4, and reached the #2 spot in the Official UK Chart. The album was produced by Jacknife Lee. The first single, ""The Prayer"", was released on January 29. This single had been located on their MySpace since November 22, 2006. The next single, ""I Still Remember"", is their first American single. In the build up to the release of the album, Zane Lowe aired a live set from Maida Vale featuring a mix of old songs and new ones on his evening radio show on BBC Radio 1 on January 30, 2007. On February 1, 2007, A Weekend in the City was made available to listen to for free through the band's official MySpace page.

The band's first gig following the release of AWITC was on February 5 at Reading Hexagon. It was broadcasted live on BBC's Music Station 6 Music that night as well.

Bloc Party played in the Live Earth concerts on July 7, 2007 and T in the Park and the Oxegen Festival that same weekend, as well as Glastonbury and the Reading and Leeds Festivals 2007. 

On 27th October, Bloc Party showed ""Flux"" to the world at their gig during the BBC Electric Proms, and on November 12th, they released the single. It charted well, reaching #8 in the UK charts, and was well received both by critics and fans, despite the new electronic direction.

On 7th July, Bloc Party premiered new track ""Mercury"" on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show following a countdown timer on Bloc Party's website. The track took a bold new direction, moving away from guitar rock, with an experimental electronic sound. The track charted at #16 in the UK charts when it was released as a single on the 11th of August.

On the 18th of August, in a webcam chat with fans, they announced that their third album, Intimacy, would be released for download on their website on the 21st of August. The album contained 
On the 23rd and 24th of August, Bloc Party played second headliners before The Killers at Reading & Leeds Festivals, opening their set with ""Mercury"", and also playing ""One Month Off"" from their new album. They also played an entirely unplanned encore of ""She's Hearing Voices"". 

The album Intimacy was released in physical formats on October 27th, featuring additional tracks, such as current single ""Talons"".

In June 2009 it was announced that a new single, ""One More Chance"", would be released on 10 August 2009. The song did not appear on Intimacy and was produced by Jacknife Lee. It was played for the first time on BBC Radio 1 on 18 June. In an interview with Zane Lowe immediately following the premier playing of the song, Okereke said that he was in the studio but that he couldn't ""tell you anything"" 
In July 2009, Okereke stated that the band did not have a current recording contract and had no obligation or pressure to release a new album in the foreseeable future; he went on to suggest that the release of a fourth album is on an indefinite timescale 

On 31 October 2009 the band played their final gig of the Bloctober tour at Bournemouth International Centre, home town of drummer Matt Tong. This was recognised as the band's last gig before going on hiatus.

In a February 2010 interview with NME Magazine, Lissack answered direct questions about Bloc Party's future, saying:

""We're probably going to pick up again with Bloc Party later this year. I mean, we wrote a lot of new material on the last tour. What does it sound like? It's hard to say. It's still just sketches of songs. The feel will come together in the studio. We're definitely not splitting up, there's a lot more creative life left in it yet.""

On 11 July 2012, the band released ""Octopus"", the first single from their upcoming fourth album ""Four"". The album was released on 20 August 2012.

During the summer tour of 2013, drummer Matt Tong left the band. Lissack told a Canadian newspaper, the National Post that the band were planning to take an indefinite hiatus following their appearance at the Latitude Festival on 19 July.

In September 2014, Okereke stated that Bloc Party were working on a fifth album. In March 2015, bassist Gordon Moakes tweeted he had parted ways with Bloc Party. Bloc Party unveiled their new line-up at two intimate gigs in the Los Angeles area (19 August 2015 at The Glass House in Pomona and 20 August 2015 at The Roxy in Los Angeles). Following these performances, Bloc Party also subheadlined FYF Fest in Los Angeles on 22 August 2015. At these shows, the band confirmed that they've finished recording their next album. The shows marked the live debut for new bassist Justin Harris of the Portland, Oregon, indie rock outfit Menomena, who had previously opened several Bloc Party U.S. tour dates in April 2009; and drummer Louise Bartle, who was accidentally announced a month earlier as Bloc Party's drummer by instrument manufacturer Natal Drums.

In a performance at Maida Vale, Bloc Party gave ""The Good News"" its live debut; hours later, ""The Love Within"" was featured as ""Hottest Record in the World"" by Annie Mac on BBC Radio 1. Okereke revealed the band's upcoming fifth album is set to be titled Hymns. The album's release was later confirmed on social media as 29 January 2016. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Justice,"There are Nine artists with this name:
1. a popular French electronic music duo
2. a Belgian hardcore band
3. a German thrash metal band
4. an English drum 'n' bass producer
5. an Irish folk band
6. a reggae musician
7. a Croatian thrash metal band
8. a Swedish musician
9. a Holland based hardcore dj

1) Justice is an electronic music duo from Paris, France, formed in 2003 and consisting of Gaspard Augé (born 21 May, 1979) and Xavier de Rosnay  (born 2 July, 1982). They are mostly known for their remix of Simian’s “Never Be Alone”, later renamed “We Are Your Friends”, as well as their “Waters of Nazareth” EP and their single release of ‘’D.A.N.C.E.’‘. Their debut album is entitled “†” but is often spelled out “Cross”. Justice are the most commercially successful act on the label of Pedro Winter (Busy P), Ed Banger.

2) Justice In the summer of 2003 a couple of young hardcore enthusiasts put their heads together and decided to create a band that would stir things up and speak out. Bummed out but at the same time motivated by the stale state of affairs in hardcore at the time, JUSTICE burst onto the scene with an unseen energy, a righteous attitude and the determination to turn things around. More than three years down the line and after some line up changes, a slew of well received releases (their demo, two EP's and a full length) and countless tours and shows (in Europe and the States), it is safe to say their mission's been accomplished. JUSTICE has become a household name to hardcore/punk kids worldwide and they have accomplished that by doing what they do best: writing catchy, honest and meaningful songs and backing it all up with an insane work ethic.

What all the nay-sayers and know-it-alls had to say never phased JUSTICE. They just continued to work hard and never looked back. For them, this isn't about being cool or receiving praise... It is about a love for hardcore in all its aspects and a will to be heard. Not content with sitting back and waiting for things to happen, they have put out most of their own records and booked most of their own tours. Not afraid of change, the have continued to broaden their sound with every release, challenging themselves and the listener to take things a few steps further every time. Sure, the energy still oozes from the cracks and that youthful anger is still there, but through the years JUSTICE's sound has become more melodic, soulful and grooving.

For their second full length album, ""Escapades"", JUSTICE decided to team up with Reflections Records from Holland. This hardworking and well respected label will definitely make sure that the band's unique sound and message gets out to everyone wants to hear it and everyone that loves their hardcore true and authentic. ""Escapades"" is a record that needs to be heard. It deserves to be heard because it is genuine, honest and strong. A relief in these days of pre-packaged angst and anger. A breath of fresh air among the so many bands that just go through the motions. Simply put, ""Escapades"" is their most daring and challenging record to date. JUSTICE have gone all the way, both musically and lyrically, to give us 110 percent. Nothing less. They've put their hearts on display and have dug deeper than ever to write the best bunch of songs they possibly could.

Two of these songs could already be heard on 2006's ""Up And Down/Push It To Edge"" EP, which already served as a good indication of what was still to come. This is a record that will take some getting used to and will only reveal its true power after several spins. Once it grabs a hold of you though, it won't let go. From the anthemic and infectious opener ""I Need Air"" (featuring Richie Birkenhead on guest vocals), through the heavily grooving ""Unsure"" and all the way to the introspective and surprisingly mellow last song titled ""Oh How We Laughed"", ""Escapades"" is one hell of a record. It twists and turns, slows down and speeds up, all at the right times. It is melodic, but never weak. It is honest and emotional, but never corny or lame. ""Escapades"" is who JUSTICE were Honest. Strong. True. 

Justice Played their last show the 8th of March 2008 and released one final 12"" ep along with their demise.

Justice released two LPs, two 7 inches and a 12"" EP. Members are now in Rhythm To The Madness, Loud And Clear and Rise And Fall. http://www.myspace.com/justicehc.

Danny Brown,"Born Daniel Sewell on March 16, 1981, Danny Brown is a hip-hop artist from the Dexter-Linwood area of Detroit, Michigan. Danny is an unconventional hip-hop artist who employs multiple flows and cadences, thus the moniker “The Hybrid”. His style varies from low pitched gravelly tones to a manic, high-pitched squawk. His lyrics often deal with the truth of living in Detroit: poverty, drug abuse, desperate circumstances, etc. and his own experiences in the motor city, from selling drugs to underground parties in Detroit’s rave scene. He is known for juxtaposing those topics with a humorous narrative told ferociously over avant-garde production choices.

Danny has released many free projects over the web, the most popular being 2011’s XXX. Brown released the album ""Hawaiian Snow” with G-Unit’s Tony Yayo and several mixtapes (Detroit State of Mind 1-4, Browntown, It’s A Art (with producer Mainframe) and Hot Soup). Brown has found much success on the internet through the support of the music blogs and social media and the decision to release “The Hybrid” online as a free download. 

Danny has worked with many artists in the Detroit hip-hop community such as the late J Dilla, Black Milk, Elzhi, Guilty Simpson, Trick Trick, and T3. Also known for championing up-and-coming artists, Danny has worked with lesser known acts such as Oakland, California's Main Attrakionz and is know for promoting these types of underground acts via his twitter.

Brown spent most of the summer of 2010 touring with G-Unit, and a few months later released “Hawaiian Snow” with Tony Yayo. Due to lack of promotion the sales were disappointing, however through the G-Unit connection Brown was able to experience firsthand the rigors of touring and the workings of the music industry as a whole. The experience served to jade Danny to the concepts of being on a major label and committing himself to appealing to an urban audience who he felt rejected him because of his look and style of dress which consisted of skinny jeans and vintage tees as 50 Cent refused to sign Danny Brown to G-Unit because he didn’t approve of his distaste for baggy denim. No longer concentrating on appealing to any particular audience, With this new found freedom, Danny delved into making more experimental music based on influences like UK Grime and Progressive Rock.

His experimental sound melded with traditional street narrative has brought about attention from progressive press such as Pitchfork.com, Fader Magazine, Spin Magazine and the like but no press more satisfying than making the cover of the Detroit Metro Times, his hometown’s alternative art’s and culture magazine. 

Danny’s music later found a home on Fool’s Gold Records, the independent label helmed by internationally heralded DJ A-Trak and his partner Nick Catchdubs. The label and the artist having the same mindset, the two parties are now focused on releasing his upcoming projects, a free album coming Summer 2011 entitled “XXX” and his untitled Fool’s Gold records debut coming subsequently after. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Portishead,"Portishead are a band from Bristol, United Kingdom, named after a small coastal town twelve miles west of said musical hotbed, in North Somerset. They were initially known for their use of jazz samples and some hip-hop beats along with various synth sounds and the hauntingly beautiful vocals of singer Beth Gibbons. Their current sound drops the samples in favour of a harder, more abrasive edge, but retains Gibbons' vocals.

The band was formed in 1991 (then later split in 2005 reforming in 2008), by keyboardist / multi-instrumentalist Geoff Barrow, Adrian Utley and singer Beth Gibbons. Barrow had previously worked with Massive Attack and Tricky whilst tape operator at Coach House Studios in Clifton. He was often referred to as ""that bloke from Portishead"" and so decided to name his new musical endeavour after his hometown.

""Dummy"" (1994)
After releasing a short film (To Kill A Dead Man) and its accompanying music, Portishead signed a record deal with Go! Beat and their first album, 'Dummy', was released in 1994. It featured heavy contributions from guitarist Adrian Utley. In spite of the band's media-shyness, the album gained universal critical acclaim and was successful on both sides of the Atlantic, spawning three hit singles, ""Glory Box"", ""Sour Times"" and ""Numb"". The album won the British Mercury Music Prize in 1995 beating albums such as Definitely Maybe by Oasis and Leftfield's Leftism. 

""Portishead"" (1997)
Their second album, 'Portishead', was released in 1997, and featured the single ""All Mine"". A live album featuring new orchestral arrangements of the group's songs was recorded primarily at Roseland in New York City and released in 1998, as well as a DVD of the Roseland concert.

In 2002, Gibbons collaborated on a separate solo project with Paul Webb, or Rustin' Man. The album, 'Out of Season', was released in the UK in October 2002, and a year later was released in the U.S.

In the time between 'Portishead' and 'Third', Portishead collaborated with singer Tom Jones for a track on his album 'Reload', and also covered Serge Gainsbourg's ""Un Jour Comme Un Autre"" (""Requiem for Anna"") in 2006 on the tribute album 'Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited'.

The band appeared live for the first time in seven years at the 2005 Tsunami Benefit Concert in Bristol. Also in 2005, Utley and Barrow produced The Coral's 'The Invisible Invasion'. Barrow along with Utley, Clive Deamer and John Baggott also assisted with the production of Stephanie McKay's 'McKay' album in 2003 under the Go!Beat label. Utley also contributed to the 'Black Cherry' album by Goldfrapp.

In December 2007, Portishead hosted the ATP Nightmare before Christmas party. Portishead played live on both nights of the festival. The set included 4 new tracks from their then-upcoming new album. Video recordings of Portishead ATP performance can be found on YouTube. 

""Third"" (2008) 
Portishead's long awaited third album simply titled 'Third' was released at the end of April 2008 to coincide with Coachella, where they were headlining. The first single, 'Machine Gun', was released on April 14 as a 12"" vinyl. It was made available on (your very own) Last.fm one week before release. 


In 2009 Geoff Barrow produced the second album Primary Colours by The Horrors.

In 2015, Portishead headlined at Latitude Festival in UK on July 18th.

Phil Collins,"Phil Collins (Philip David Charles Collins LVO, born 30 January 1951 in Chiswick, London) is an English singer-songwriter, drummer, keyboardist and actor best known as a drummer and vocalist for the English progressive rock group Genesis and as well as being a Grammy and Academy Award-winning solo artist.

Collins sang the lead vocals on eight American chart-toppers between 1984 and 1989, seven of those as a solo artist and one with Genesis. His singles, often dealing with lost love, have ranged from the atmospheric ""In the Air Tonight"" to the dance pop of ""Sussudio"" to the political statements of his most successful song ""Another Day in Paradise"". His latest (and possibly his last) album, the cover album 'Going Back' that came out in 2010, particularly shows the massive influence of 60s American soul music on Collins' career. His international popularity transformed Genesis from a cult favourite rock group to a regular on the pop charts and an early MTV mainstay. According to britishhitsongwriters.com, he is the forty-eighth most successful songwriter in U.K. singles chart history based on weeks that his compositions have spent on the chart.

Collins' professional career began as a drummer, starting first with the obscure space rock group Flaming Youth. Then, working with the avant-garde band Genesis, Collins originally supplied backing vocals for frontman Peter Gabriel and provided drumming that was a key part of their sound. Collins sung lead on only two songs: ""For Absent Friends"" from 1971's 'Nursery Cryme' album and ""More Fool Me"" from 'Selling England by the Pound', which was released in 1973. Upon Gabriel's departure in 1975, Collins became the group's lead singer after much soul-searching in the band's line-up. While keeping a similar art rock and progressive music based sound for several years, the band evolved into more of a melodic pop rock direction. As the decade closed, Genesis' first international hit, ""Follow You, Follow Me"", demonstrated a drastic change from the band's early years.

His concurrent solo career, heavily influenced by his personal life, brought both Collins and Genesis commercial success. His songwriting has often drawn from American rnb artists of the 60s, 70s, and 80s while his singing has taken inspiration from his predecessor in Genesis, Peter Gabriel. According to Atlantic Records, Collins' total worldwide sales as a solo artist, as of 2002, were 150 million.

Collins announced in March 2011 that he is retiring from the music business. ""I am stopping so I can be a full time father to my two young sons on a daily basis,"" he wrote on his website. His statement refers to his two sons, Nicholas and Matthew, with his third wife Orianne Cevey, whom he divorced in 2008.

Eagles,"Eagles are an American rock band that was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1971. Currently consisting of vocalist/drummer Don Henley, vocalist/guitarist Glenn Frey, guitarist/vocalist Joe Walsh and bassist/vocalist Timothy B. Schmit, the band had five Number 1 singles and six Number 1 albums. the Eagles were one of the most successful recording artists of the 1970s. The Eagles' album, Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975 was named as the best-selling album of the 20th Century with 26 million sold, and, along with the album Hotel California, was ranked among the ten all time best-selling albums by the Recording Industry Association of America. The band’s recording and touring schedule gradually slowed until they broke up in the fall of 1980 for what became a fourteen year hiatus.

Each of the members has pursued a solo career, with Don Henley’s the most successful commercially and critically. In the ’90s, after what they considered a ""14 year break"", the band’s sound was frequently cited as an influence by young country stars, many of whom contributed tracks to the album Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles (#3, 1993), which won Album of the Year at the 1994 Country Music Associations's CMA Awards. That same year, the Eagles revival culminated in the band’s reunion tour and album.

The group originally coalesced from L.A.’s country-rock community. Before producer John Boylan assembled them as Linda Ronstadt’s backup band on her album Silk Purse (1970), the four original Eagles were already experienced professionals. Bernie Leadon had played in the Dillard and Clark Expedition and the Flying Burrito Brothers; Randy Meisner, with Poco and Rick Nelson’s Stone Canyon Band. Glenn Frey had played with various Detroit rock bands (including Bob Seger’s) and Longbranch Pennywhistle (with J.D. Souther, a sometime songwriting partner), and Henley had been with a transplanted Texas group, Shiloh. After working with Ronstadt, Henley and Frey decided to form the Eagles, recruiting Leadon and Meisner.

Intending to take the country rock of the Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers a step further toward hard rock, the Eagles recorded their first album with producer Glyn Johns in England. Take It Easy (#12, 1972), written by Frey and Jackson Browne, went gold shortly after its release, as did their debut album of the same name. (Another single, Witchy Woman, reached #9 that year.) 

Desperado was a concept album with enough of a plot line to encourage rumors of a movie version. The LP yielded no major pop hits, but its title track,  Desperado, a ballad penned by Henley and Frey, has become a classic rock standard covered by Linda Ronstadt among others. 

With On the Border, the Eagles changed producers, bringing in Bill Szymczyk (who worked on all subsequent albums through 1982’s Greatest Hits, vol. 2) and adding  Don Felder, who had recorded with Flow in Gainesville, Florida (and who once gave guitar lessons to another Gainesville native, Tom Petty), then became a session guitarist and studio engineer in New York, Boston, and L.A.

The increased emphasis on rock attracted more listeners - mid-’70s hits included Best of My Love (#1, 1975), One of These Nights (#1, 1975), Lyin’ Eyes (#2, 1975), and Take It to the Limit (#4, 1975) - but alienated Leadon. After One of These Nights, Leadon left to form the Bernie Leadon–Michael Georgiades Band, which released Natural Progressions in 1977. (Leadon went on to become a Nashville session musician, and in the ’90s formed Run-C&W, a jokester group who played a blend of country and R&B.)

Leadon was replaced by Joe Walsh, who had established himself with the James Gang and as a solo artist. His Eagles debut, Hotel California, was their third consecutive #1 album (the second was their record-breaking 1976 greatest-hits compilation). New Kid in Town (#1, 1976), the title cut Hotel California (#1, 1977), and Life in the Fast Lane (#11, 1977) spurred sales of more than 15 million copies worldwide.

Meisner left in 1977, replaced by Timothy B. Schmit, who had similarly replaced him in Poco. Meisner has released two solo albums, Randy Meisner (1978) and One More Song (1980). (In 1981, he toured with the Silveradoes; later, in 1990, Meisner reemerged in the group Black Tie, alongside Billy Swan and Bread’s James Griffin.) Henley and Frey sang backup on One More Song, and in the late ’70s they also appeared on albums by Bob Seger and Randy Newman. In 1981 Henley duetted with Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks on the #6 single Leather and Lace. 

Between outside projects and legal entanglements, it took the Eagles two years and $1 million to make the multiplatinum LP The Long Run, their last album of all-new material. Parting hit singles included Heartache Tonight (#1, 1979), The Long Run (#8, 1980), and I Can’t Tell You Why (#8, 1980).

Walsh continued to release solo albums, though his biggest single to date has been 1978’s cheeky Life’s Been Good (#12). Felder and Schmit also put out their own albums and contributed songs to film soundtracks. Schmit’s second LP, Timothy B, included Boys Night Out (#25, 1987).

In 1982 Don Henley and Glenn Frey both embarked on solo careers. Frey charted with The One You Love (#15, 1982) and Sexy Girl (#20, 1984) before a movie proved his ticket into the Top 10: The Heat Is On, featured in Beverly Hills Cop, shot to #2 in 1985. 

Frey followed this success by becoming an actor, making a guest appearance as a drug dealer on the popular TV series Miami Vice. The episode was based on a track from his album The Allnighter, Smuggler’s Blues, which consequently reached #12 (1985). Later in 1985, Frey’s You Belong to the City hit #2. While still dabbling in acting with roles in the short-lived TV series South of Sunset, the movie Jerry Maguire, and a guest spot on the Don Johnson post–Miami Vice series Nash Bridges in the ’90s, Frey also cofounded a music label, Mission Records, in 1997.

Ultimately, though, Henley was the ex-Eagle who garnered the greatest chart success, and the most critical acclaim as well. His Dirty Laundry (from his first solo effort, I Can’t Stand Still) made it to #3, but the 1985 album Building the Perfect Beast was to be his true arrival as solo hitmaker and respected singer/songwriter. The kickoff single, The Boys of Summer, went to #5 - supported by an evocative black-and-white video that fast became an MTV favourite - and earned Henley a Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male; the hits All She Wants to Do Is Dance (#9, 1985) and Sunset Grill (#22, 1985) followed. A third album, The End of the Innocence, produced a #8 title track, End of the Innocence, and the additional singles The Last Worthless Evening and The Heart of the Matter, which both hit #21. The LP won Henley another Grammy, in the same category as before.

In the early ’90s, Henley sought release from his Geffen Records contract, initiating a long and bitter legal dispute. After participating in the release of a solo best-of album in 1995, Henley was freed from his contract. Five years later, he released a studio album of all-new material, Inside Job (coproduced by former Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers drummer Stan Lynch), and embarked on a solo tour to support it. Henley had married for the first time in May 1995 and had three children before releasing Inside Job. This life-altering change for the longtime bachelour resulted in a new theme in his songwriting; several of Inside Job’s tracks were clearly about marriage and family, including the gentle ballad Taking You Home (#58 pop, #1 Adult Contemporary, 2000). Much of the rest of the album, however, still explored Henley’s cynicism toward the business world and the media.

In 1990 Henley founded the Walden Woods Project, dedicated to preserving historic lands around Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts (where Henry David Thoreau and others reflected and wrote), from corporate development. Among the singer’s various fund-raising means were holding charity concerts, featuring other top rock artists, and donating proceeds from some of his own recordings, including a reggae version of the Guys and Dolls standard “Sit Down You’re Rocking the Boat” (1993). In 1993 the Walden Woods Project got a big boost from Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles, coorganised by Henley and featuring Clint Black, Trisha Yearwood, Travis Tritt, and others.

In 1994, after years of fielding off reunion rumours, Henley, Frey, Walsh, Felder, and Schmit - who had appeared together in the video for Tritt’s version of Take It Easy - hit the road for a massively successful tour, the third-highest grossing concert tour of that year. The tour went on hiatus toward the end of 1994, due to Frey’s gastrointestinal surgery, but it continued in 1995. In November 1994, the band released Hell Freezes Over, which featured four new songs, including the singles Get Over It (#31, 1994), Love Will Keep Us Alive (#1 Adult Contemporary, 1994), Learn to Be Still (#15 Adult Contemporary, 1995), and 11 of the old hits culled from the band’s 1994 live appearance on MTV. Within months the reunion LP had sold more than 10 million copies and gone to #1 on the pop album chart.

In 1998 the Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. All seven members of the band performed together for the first time at the induction ceremony. The core members of the group - the ones who had recorded and toured together in the mid-’90s - reunited again for a few concerts at the end of 1999, including a New Year’s Eve show in L.A. A four-CD retrospective set, Eagles 1972–1999: Selected Works (#109, 2000), was released in November 2000.

Don Felder was fired from the band in 2000, leaving Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit as the remaining members of the band.

In 2007 they released a double album Long Road out of Eden, logically followed by a world tour, which was, regardless of people's opinion on the new album, a guaranteed sold-out event. The base line-up on this album is Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit. Also performing on the studio recording are Steuart Smith (guitar, keyboard, mandolin), Scott Crago (percussion) and Will Hollis (keyboard). 

On January 18, 2016, it was announced that Glenn Frey had died at the age of 67 in New York City from complications arising from rheumatoid arthritis, colitis and pneumonia. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Eagles"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Warpaint,"Warpaint is a psychedelic rock band which formed in 2004 in Los Angeles, California, United States. The band consists of Theresa Wayman (vocals, guitar), Emily Kokal (vocals, guitar), Jenny Lee Lindberg (vocals, bass), and Stella Mozgawa (drums). The band's original drummer, Shannyn Sossamon, left the band in 2008. The band had multiple temporary drummers until Mozgawa joined in 2009.

The band weaves intricate guitar lines, hypnotic vocals, and driving post-punk rhythms into gorgeous, sprawling songs that skirt the line between the soundscapes of psychedelia and intimacy. The group has gone through many line-up changes, including actress Shannyn Sossamon and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer.

In early 2009, their self-released debut EP ""Exquisite Corpse"" soared straight to #1 on legendary Los Angeles Amoeba Records’ local artists chart. By September 2009, Manimal Vinyl reissued it on CD and vinyl, complete with a new bonus track, ‘Krimson’. Mixed by John Frusciante (Red Hot Chili Peppers), the EP successfully captures the band’s sonic textures and playful dynamism that they’re notorious for creating in a live setting. With a buzz already in the air, Warpaint is now beginning to stir the masses with praise in the US and abroad. Dazed and Confused calls ""Exquisite Corpse"" ""a collection of magical psychedelia drifting over sublime moments of raw melody courtesy of the three free ethereal vocalists,” while The Independent adds, “They make a quite lovely sound with dreamy vocals, off-kilter hazy guitars.”

On October 25, 2010, the band released their debut album, The Fool. The album received a glowing review in the NME. Prior to the album's release, the band contributed a cover of the David Bowie song ""Ashes to Ashes"" to We Were So Turned On, a Bowie tribute album released in conjunction with War Child.

""Shadows"", the first single from their debut album, was released as a digital download and 12"" vinyl on January 10, 2011. A remix of the single, ""Shadows (Neon Lights Remix)"", proved popular; managing to be playlisted by BBC Radio 1 as part of the In New Music We Trust.

Warpaint toured the United States and Europe in the spring and summer of 2011 to promote the album. They played at various major festivals including Bonnaroo, Glastonbury Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Rock Werchter and Electric Picnic.

In 2011, the rerelease of Undertow charted in the UK at number 92 and also in Australia at number 75. On September 25, 2011 they played the prestigious Hollywood Bowl (as a support act).

As early as 2011, drummer Stella Mozgawa, in an interview with NME, expressed the band's intention to ""experiment and write with one another"" as the current line-up had never composed songs ""from the ground up"" together. Bassist Jenny Lee Lindberg further indicated that most of the newer songs were written by ""just jam[ming] and free-flow[ing] onstage"". 

In February 2013, Guitarist Theresa Wayman confirmed to NME that the band intended to create a minimalist sound on Warpaint, revealing that the band developed songs at soundchecks, and experimented more with acoustic guitars and percussion instruments on the album. Lead vocalist Emily Kokal noted that R&B and rap music was an influence on Warpaint and stated that on the album there are ""things that have drum machines and ambience, music that's more than standard rock."" Kokal added that the album is largely keys-based, which contributed to the overall sound being ""definitely different"" from the band's previous album The Fool (2010).

Produced by Flood and mixed by Nigel Godrich, Warpaint is due to be released in Germany, Ireland, Netherlands and Switzerland on January 17, 2014; January 20 in Denmark, France, Sweden and the United Kingdom; and January 21 in Spain and the United States on Rough Trade Records. A snippet of the album's lead single, ""Love Is to Die"", was featured in an advertisement for Calvin Klein on September 25, 2013 and later as part of a teaser for an upcoming documentary of the same name about the recording of Warpaint. The single was released on October 28 with the pre-ordered digital version of the album.

On November 20, Warpaint performed ""Composure,"" from The Fool, as well as new songs ""Love Is to Die"" and ""Keep It Healthy"" on BBC 6 Music with Steve Lamacq in the United Kingdom. The next day, an article from the December 2013 issue of Dazed & Confused magazine appeared online, providing insight into the making of the new album, as well as the accompanying documentary, filmed by Jenny Lee Lindberg's husband and filmmaker, Chris Cunningham. Lindberg later confirmed in a November 24 interview on XFM that Cunningham's documentary would be made available shortly after the album's release.

The Velvet Underground,"The Velvet Underground was a pioneering experimental rock band from New York City first active from 1965 to 1973. Its best-known lineup consisted of vocalist/guitarist Lou Reed, bassist/violist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker. The band also collaborated with Nico for their debut album in 1967, under the supervision of producer and pop artist Andy Warhol.

Some see The Velvet Underground as being a bridge between the pacifist themes of the late 60s and the sheer chaos and indifference of the mid-70s punk movement.

The Velvet Underground was one of the first rock music groups to experiment heavily with the form by incorporating avant-garde influences. The group's often raw, sometimes difficult sound would influence many later punk, noise rock, and alternative music performers, and singer Lou Reed's lyrics brought new levels of social realism and sleaze to rock. Critics Scott Isler and Ira Robbins argue that ""The Velvet Underground marked a turning point in rock history. After the release of The Velvet Underground & Nico knowing the power of which it was capable, the music could never be as innocent, as unselfconscious as before.""

Pre-history (1964-1965)

The foundations for what would become The Velvet Underground were laid in late 1964. Lou Reed had performed with a few short-lived garage bands and had worked as a songwriter for Pickwick Records, a job Reed described as ""a poor man's Carole King"". Reed met John Cale, a Welshman who had moved to the United States to study classical music. Cale had worked with John Cage and La Monte Young, but was also interested in rock music. (Young's use of extended drones would be a profound influence on the early Velvet's sound). The pair rehearsed and performed together, and their partnership and shared interests steered the early direction of what would become the Velvet Underground.

Reed's first group with Cale was the short-lived The Primitives, assembled to support a Reed-penned single, ""The Ostrich"". Reed and Cale recruited Sterling Morrison – a college classmate of Reed's who had already played with him a few times – to play guitar, and Angus MacLise to play percussion. This quartet was first called The Warlocks, then The Falling Spikes.

While moving into his New York City apartment Reed found the book The Velvet Underground by Michael Leigh, a book about sadomasochism, left by previous tenant Tony Conrad. Reed and Morrison have reported the group liked the name, considering it evocative of ""underground cinema,"" and fitting, due to Reed's already having written ""Venus In Furs"", inspired by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's book of the same name, also dealing with sadomasochism. The band immediately and unanimously adopted the book's title for its new name.

Early stages (1965-1966)

The newly named Velvet Underground rehearsed and performed in New York City. Their music was generally much more relaxed than it would later become: Cale described this era as reminiscent of beatnik poetry, with MacLise playing gentle ""pitter and patter rhythms behind the drone"".

In July of 1965, Reed, Cale and Morrison recorded a demo tape. When he briefly returned to Britain, Cale gave a copy of the tape to Marianne Faithfull, hoping she'd pass it on to Mick Jagger. Nothing ever came of the demo. The demo was eventually released on the 1995 box set Peel Slowly and See.

When the group accepted an offer of $75 for their first paying performance at Summit High School, in Summit, NJ, MacLise left the group, protesting what he considered a sell out. ""Angus was in it for art"", Morrison reported.

MacLise was replaced by Maureen Tucker, Jim Tucker's younger sister. Tucker's abbreviated drum kit was rather unusual: She generally played on tom toms and an upturned bass drum, using mallets rather than drumsticks, and she rarely used cymbals. The band having asked her to 'do something unusual', she turned her bass drum on its side, and played standing up. When her drums were stolen from one club, she replaced them with garbage cans, brought in from outside. Her driving rhythms were at once simple yet exotic, influenced by Babatunde Olatunji and Bo Diddley records, and became an essential part of the group's music. The group earned a regular paying gig at a club, and gained an early reputation as a promising ensemble.

While the American west coast was undergoing the Summer of Love, psychedelia and flower power, the typically east coast Velvets concerned themselves with darker subject matter: transvestites, heroin addiction, and sadomasochism. Also setting them apart from their contemporaries was their use of feedback and amplifier noise in a musical context, exemplified by the seventeen minute track ""Sister Ray"" from their White Light/White Heat album.

Andy Warhol and the Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable (1966-1967)

Andy Warhol became the band's manager in 1965, and suggested they feature the German-born singer Nico on several songs. Warhol's reputation certainly helped the band gain a higher profile. Though Reed eventually fired Warhol, he praised the integrity of his early efforts with the group. Warhol helped the band land a coveted recording contract with MGM's Verve Records, with himself as nominal 'producer', and gave the Velvets unprecedented free reign over the sound they created.

During their stay with Andy Warhol, the band became part of his multimedia roadshow Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable., for which they provided the musical part. This show played a couple of months in New York City, then took to the road all over the United States and Canada until its last installment in May 1967.

In 1966, MacLise temporarily rejoined the Velvet Underground for a few E.P.I. shows when Reed was suffering from hepatitis and unable to perform. For these appearances, Cale sang and played organ and Tucker switched to bass guitar. Also at these appearances, the band often played an extended jam they had dubbed ""The Booker T"", after the leader of the musical group Booker T & the MG's; the jam later became the music for ""The Gift"" on White Light/White Heat. Some of these performances have been released as a bootleg; they remain the only recordings of MacLise with the Velvet Underground.

The Velvet Underground and Nico (1967)

At Warhol's insistence, Nico sang with the Velvet Underground on four songs off their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico. The album was recorded in one or two days — there is some uncertainty between the band members' memories — at TT&G Studios during the November of 1966, and released by MGM Records in March of 1967.

The album cover was famous for its simple, suggestive Warhol design: a bright yellow banana with ""Peel Slowly and See"" printed near a perforated tab. Those who did remove the banana skin found a pink, phallic, peeled banana beneath. This would later be used as the cover to their boxed set, appropriately titled ""Peel Slowly and See,"" released in 1995.

Eleven songs showcased their stylistic range, veering from the pounding attacks of ""I'm Waiting For The Man"" and ""Run Run Run,"" the droning ""Venus In Furs"" and ""Heroin"" to the quiet ""Femme Fatale"" and the tender ""I'll Be Your Mirror"".

The overall sound was propelled by Reed's strong deadpan vocals, Cale's droning or shrieking viola, Morrison's often rhythm and blues or country-influenced guitar, and Tucker's hypnotically simple but steady, propulsive beat.

The Velvet Underground & Nico peaked at number 171 on Billboard Magazine's top 200 charts, but the promising debut was dampened somewhat by legal complications: The album's back cover featured a still from a Warhol motion picture, Chelsea Girls. The film's cinematographer, Eric Emerson, had been arrested for drug possession and, desperate for money, claimed the still had been included on the album without his permission. MGM Records pulled all copies of the album until the legal problems were settled (by which time the record had lost its modest commercial momentum), and the still was airbrushed out.

White Light/White Heat (1968)

The Velvet Underground performed live often, and their performances became louder, harsher and often featured extended improvisations. Cale reports that at about this time, The Velvet Underground were one of the first groups to receive an endorsement from Vox. The company pioneered a number of special effects, which the Velvet Underground utilized on White Light/White Heat.

Reed fired Warhol as manager, and Nico was jettisoned, partly due to her unreliability. In September 1967, the VU recorded what would become their second album, White Light/White Heat, with Tom Wilson as producer. It was released January 1968.

The recording was raw and oversaturated, one of the harshest, loudest records yet released. Cale has stated that while the debut had some moments of fragility and beauty, White Light/White Heat was ""consciously anti-beauty"". Isler and Robbins suggest that the record ""is almost unbearably intense.""

The title track and first song starts things off with Reed pounding on piano like a demented Jerry Lee Lewis. The eerie, hallucinatory ""Lady Godiva's Operation"" remains Reed's favorite track on the album.

Despite the dominance of noisefests like ""Sister Ray"", and ""I Heard Her Call My Name"", there was room for the darkly comic ""The Gift"", a Reed-penned short story narrated in Cale's deadpan Welsh accent. The meditative ""Here She Comes Now"" was later covered by Galaxie 500, Cabaret Voltaire, and Nirvana.

In 1968, a year after Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Are You Experienced, there was an experimental feeling throughout rock music, while it should be noted that the Velvets are arguably the foremost pioneers in this realm. There were a few other experimenters with noise, but few were tackling noise with as much apparent glee as the V.U. White Light/White Heat was hugely important, and ""Sister Ray"" is arguably one of the most significant rock songs of the late 1960s. The songs' simple 3-chord progression along with screeching organ and lead guitar, all distorted perhaps beyond the bounds of tastefulness, coupled with William Burroughs-influenced lyrics, was completely unique. ""Sister Ray"" is often seen as one of the earliest precursors of punk and Alternative rock, with its blistering instrumentation and alarming lyrics.

The second album's cover was a subtle black-on-black picture of the tattooed arm of Billy Name, one of Warhol's ""Factory"" members. White Light/White Heat entered the Billboard top 200 chart for 2 weeks, at number 199.

Tensions were growing: the group was tired of receiving little recognition for their hard work, and Reed and Cale were pulling the Velvet Underground in different directions. The differences showed in the last recording session the band had with John Cale in February 1968: two pop-like songs in Reed's direction (""Temptation Inside Your Heart"" and ""Stephanie Says""), and a viola-driven drone in Cale's direction (""Hey Mr Rain""). None of these songs were released until they were included on the VU and Another View compilation albums.

The Velvet Underground (1969)

Before work on their third album started, Reed fired Cale, and replaced him with Doug Yule. The Velvet Underground was recorded in late 1968, and released in March of 1969.

It's often been reported that the early edition of the Velvet Underground was a struggle between Reed and Cale's creative impulses: Reed's rather conventional approach contrasted with Cale's experimentalist tendencies. The Velvet Underground would seem to prove the truth of these claims, as the harsh, abrasive tendencies on the first two records were almost entirely absent. This resulted in a gentler sound influenced by folk music, prescient of the songwriting style that would form Reed's solo career (another factor in the change of sound was the band's amplifiers being stolen from an airport while they were on tour; they obtained replacements by signing a new endorsement deal with Sunn).

Morrison's ringing guitar parts and Yule's melodic bass guitar and harmony vocals are featured prominently on the album. Reed's songs and singing are subdued and confessional, and he shared lead vocals with Yule, particularly when his own voice would fail under stress. A rare Maureen Tucker vocal is featured on ""After Hours,"" a song that Reed said was so innocent and pure he couldn't possibly sing it himself. The album's influence can be heard in many later indie rock and lo-fi recordings.

A year on the road and the ""lost"" fourth album (1969)

The Velvet Underground spent much of 1969 on the road, feeling they were not accepted in their hometown of New York City and not making much headway commercially. During the same year, the band recorded on and off in the studio, creating a lot of material that was never officially released due to disputes with their record label. What many consider the prime of these sessions was released many years later as VU. This album has a transitional sound between the whisper-soft third album and the pop-rock anthems of their final record, Loaded.

The rest of the recordings, as well as some alternate takes, were bundled on Another View. After Reed's departure, he later reworked a number of these songs for his solo records (""Stephanie Says"", ""Ocean"", ""I Can't Stand It"", ""Lisa Says"", ""She's My Best Friend""). Indeed, most of Reed's early solo career's more successful hits were reworked Velvet Underground tracks, released for the first time in their original version on VU, Another View, and later on Peel Slowly and See. The standout from VU is considered by many to be ""One of These Days,"" part torch song and part slide-guitar freakout.

Loaded (1970)

In 1969, MGM Records president Mike Curb wanted to purge any drug- or hippie-related bands from MGM, and the V.U. were on his list, along with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. (Nonetheless, MGM insisted on keeping the tapes of their unissued recordings.)

Atlantic Records signed the Velvet Underground for what would be its final studio album, Loaded, released on Atlantic's subsidiary label Cotillion. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album ""loaded with hits."" Though the record was not the smash hit the company had anticipated, it contains the most accessible pop the V.U. had performed, and several of Reed's best-known songs, including ""Sweet Jane"" and ""Rock and Roll"".

Though Tucker had temporarily retired from the group due to her pregnancy, she received a performance credit on Loaded. Drums were actually played by several people, including Yule, engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanaro, and Doug Yule's brother Billy, who was still in high school.

Disillusioned with the lack of progress the band was making and pressured by manager Sesnick, Reed decided to quit the band and did so in August 1970. The band essentially broke while recording the album, and Reed walked off before it was finished. Doug Yule finished the album, singing parts to some of Reed's vocal tracks. Lou Reed has often said he was completely surprised months later when he saw Loaded in stores. He also said, bitterly, ""I left them to their album full of hits that I made.""

Reed was particularly bitter about the truncation of a verse from ""Sweet Jane"". ""New Age"" was changed as well: as originally recorded, its closing line (""It's the beginning of a new age"") was repeated many more times. A brief interlude in ""Rock and Roll"" was also removed. (Years later, the album would be reissued with the edits restored.) On the other hand, Yule has pointed that the album was to all intents and purposes finished when Reed left the band and that Reed had been aware of most if not all of the edits. The few weeks between Reed's departure in late August and Loaded’s arrival in the shops in September of the same year also would have left little room for the whole process of editing, reviewing, mastering and pressing.

1970 onwards

Although Loaded's spin-off single ""Who Loves the Sun"" did nothing, the album itself is something of a muted triumph. ""Sweet Jane"" and ""Rock and Roll"" became U.S. radio favorites, and the band, featuring Walter Powers III on bass, and Doug Yule promoted to lead vocals and guitar, went on the road once more, playing the East Coast of the U.S. and Europe. By that time, however, Sterling Morrison had obtained a B.A. degree in English, and left the group for an academic career with the University of Texas at Austin. His replacement was singer/keyboard player Willie Alexander. The band played shows in England, Wales, and the Netherlands, some of which are collected on the 2001 box set Final V.U. (Longtime fans began mocking the new lineup as the ""Velveteen Underground"", perhaps unfairly.)

In 1972 Atlantic released Live at Max's Kansas City, a live bootleg of one of the Velvet Underground's final performances with Reed, recorded by fan Brigid Polk. By this time Doug Yule was once again touring the United Kingdom, this time backed with hired hands as Sesnick had sent home Tucker, Powers and Alexander, effectively ending their time with the band. Later that year, Sesnick managed to secure a recording contract with Polydor Records in England, and Yule recorded Squeeze under the Velvet Underground name with Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice. Squeeze is a controversial item among Velvet fans, most of whom flatly decline to consider any post-Lou Reed material as worthwhile. Rarely heard before the advent of Internet audio file sharing, the album's perceived Middle of the road content is sometimes dismissed out of hand by Velvets fans. Although the album technically is a Velvet Underground release, it is properly Doug Yule's debut solo album and it might have fared far better if it had been labeled as such, given the actual quality of most of the tracks, some of which would not have been out of place on Loaded. (Interestingly, Yule was actually in the group longer than Cale.)

Post-VU developments (1973-1990)

Reed and Cale, in the meantime, developed solo careers. Sterling Morrison was a professor for some time, teaching Medieval Literature at the University of Texas at Austin, then became a tugboat captain for several years. Maureen Tucker raised a family before returning to small-scale gigging and recording in the 1980s; Morrison was in a number of touring bands, among others with Tucker's band. In 1988, erstwhile singer Nico died of a brain hemorrhage while bicycling on the island of Ibiza.

Reunions (1990 and 1992-1994)

In 1990, Reed and Cale released Songs for Drella, dedicated to the recently deceased Andy Warhol. (""Drella"" was a nickname Warhol had adopted, a combination of ""Dracula"" and ""Cinderella"".) Though Morrison and Tucker had each worked with Reed and Cale since the V.U. broke up, Songs for Drella was the first time the mercurial pair had worked together in decades, and rumors of a reunion began to circulate, fueled by the one-off appearance by Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker to play ""Heroin"" as the encore to a brief Songs for Drella set in Jouy-en-Josas, France.

The same lineup briefly reunited from 1992–1994, resulting in a European tour — both headlining and opening a few concerts for U2 — and a live album, Live MCMXCIII. Cale sang most of the songs Nico had performed with the group.

Before the band could tour the U.S. or record — an MTV Unplugged album was proposed — Cale and Reed fell out again, breaking up the band once more. The definitive end to the band's checkered career came when Sterling Morrison died of cancer in 1995. Reed's death in 2013 put a permanent end to any hopes of further Velvet Underground reunions; tributes poured out from all corners of the internet upon the news.

In recent years, the band's first four albums have been reissued with expanded box sets featuring two to five discs' worth of bonus content. An archival series of live recordings has also been issued as The Complete Matrix Tapes, which has been praised both for its audio fidelity and for the quality of the performances (many of the recordings here were initially the source of the band's acclaimed 1969 Live album, but the sound quality has been further cleaned up).

Avenged Sevenfold,"Avenged Sevenfold (often abbreviated to A7X) are a hard rock band which formed in 1999 in Huntington Beach, California, United States. The band consists of M. Shadows (vocals), Synyster Gates (guitar), Zacky Vengeance (guitar) and Johnny Christ (bass). The band's drummer James ""The Rev"" Sullivan died in 2009, and the band has not named a permanent replacement. Currently, the band tours with former Confide drummer Arin Ilejay.

The band has released five albums since their formation: ""Sounding the Seventh Trumpet"" (2001), ""Waking the Fallen"" (2003), ""City of Evil"" (2005), ""Avenged Sevenfold"" (2007) and ""Nightmare"" (2010).

The band was formed in 1999. Avenged Sevenfold's first album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, was recorded when the band members were eighteen years old. It was originally released on their first label, Good life Recordings. After lead guitarist Synyster Gates (also known by Brian Haner Jr.) joined the band, the introductory track ""To End The Rapture"" was re-recorded with Gates playing, and the album was re-released on Hopeless Records. Their follow-up album, entitled Waking the Fallen, was also released on Hopeless Records and was awarded a positive rating in Rolling Stone magazine. Shortly after its release, Avenged Sevenfold were signed to Warner Bros. Records.

City of Evil, the third album which was released on June 7 2005, strayed from metalcore, and instead headed more towards heavy metal and adds a harder rock sound with influences ranging from various bands. During the recording of City of Evil, M. Shadows' vocal styling changed to focus more on melodic singing rather than hardcore screaming. Some cite the change in vocal style as consequence of vocal chord damage (that resulted in subsequent surgery) during a tour supporting Waking the Fallen. Shadows denies the injury as being the reason. In the ""All Excess"" DVD, producer Mudrock clarifies this subject and affirms this is not the reason why the band changed style. He says ""One thing I see on the Internet, and that I just want to set the record straight on is, when I met the band, before they recorded Waking The Fallen, Matt handed me the CD [Sounding The Seventh Trumpet] and said ""this record is screaming, the record we wanna make is half screaming and half singing. I don't wanna scream anymore, but I'm going to make a record that's half singing and half screaming, and a record after that is going to be only singing"". The already knew they wanted to make a singing record right by the time City Of Evil came out, that was two years before it came out, that's what the band wanted to do as artists.""

The band's name is a reference to the book of Genesis in the Bible where Cain is sentenced to live in exile for the crime of murdering his brother. God marked him so that none would kill him on account of his sin; the man who dared to kill Cain would have ""vengeance taken upon him sevenfold."" The title of Avenged Sevenfold's song ""Chapter Four"" references Genesis 4:15, the chapter of the Bible in which the story of Cain and Abel takes place. The song's subject also appears to be this story. ""Beast and the Harlot"", yet another song derived from the Bible, comes from the book of Revelation only it is written in the first person and refers to the punishment of Babylon the Great, world empire and seat of false religion. Another Bible reference occurs in the song ""The Wicked End"". In the song, several times it is said ""dust the apple off, savor each bite, and deep inside you know Adam was right."" making reference to Eve eating the forbidden fruit. Although the band's title and members' stage names make references to religion, Shadows stated in an interview that they are ""not really religious at all."" ""Anyone that read the lyrics and really knew anything about us, they would know we're not promoting either"", he said. ""That's one thing about this band that I love is that we never really shove any kind of, like, political or religious beliefs on people. We just, the music's there to entertain and maybe thought-provoking on both sides, but we don't try to, like, really shove anything down anyone's throat. There's too many bands that do that nowadays, I think."" 

The song ""Bat Country"" is a reference to the book/movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The song is dedicated to the Author of the book, the late Hunter S. Thompson. Their song ""Blinded In Chains"" was used in the soundtrack for the video games Need for Speed: Most Wanted and Arena Football. ""Bat Country"" was used in the soundtracks for SSX on Tour, NHL 06 and Madden 06, following in the footsteps of ""Chapter Four"" which had also been on the soundtrack for NHL 2004, Madden 2004 and NASCAR Thunder 2004. The song ""Beast and the Harlot"" was in the soundtrack for Burnout Revenge. All the above games, not coincidentally, are produced by various divisions of Electronic Arts. ""Beast and the Harlot"" also appears in RedOctane's Guitar Hero II, released in November 7, 2006. The song ""Burn it Down"" is featured on the October 24, 2006 release of the Saw III soundtrack.

During recent tours (Spring 2006 and Ozzfest 2006 tours) Avenged Sevenfold have been performing the song ""Walk"", originally by Pantera, as part of a tribute to the late Dimebag Darrell Lance Abbott.

At the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, Avenged Sevenfold received the award for best new artist. They took the award over several other artists like Angels & Airwaves and James Blunt. After canceling fall and winter 2006 tour dates, the band is planning their unnamed fourth studio album. M. Shadows has stated that it will not be a City of Evil Part 2 or Waking the Fallen Part 2, because they want to change their sound once more. They say it will be somewhat of a surprise to their fans. Some people are rejecting their new sounds, as some are embracing it.

The band released their first DVD, Avenged Sevenfold : All Excess on July 17, 2007.

Avenged Sevenfold, the band's fourth album, was released on October 30, 2007, debuting at No.4 on the Billboard 200 with over 90,000 copies sold. Two singles, ""Critical Acclaim"" and ""Almost Easy"" were released prior to the album's debut. In December 2007, an animated video was made for ""A Little Piece of Heaven."" Due to the song's controversial subject matter, however, Warner Brothers only released it to registered MVI users over the internet. The third single, ""Afterlife"" and its video was released in January 2008. Their fourth single, ""Dear God"", was released on June 15, 2008. Although critical reception was generally mixed the self-titled album went on to sell over 500,000 copies and was awarded ""Album of the Year"" at the Kerrang! Awards.

Avenged Sevenfold headlined the 2008 Taste of Chaos tour with Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine, [arist]Blessthefall and Idiot Pilot. They used the footage from their last show in Long Beach for Live in the LBC & Diamonds in the Rough, a two-disc B-sides CD and live DVD which was released on September 16, 2008. They also recorded numerous covers, including Pantera's ""Walk"", Iron Maiden's ""Flash of the Blade"" and Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"".

In January 2009, M. Shadows confirmed that the band was writing the follow-up to their self-titled fourth album within the upcoming months. They also announced that they will be playing at Rock on the Range, from May 16–17, 2009. On April 16, they performed a version of Guns N' Roses' ""It's So Easy"" onstage with Slash, at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles.

On December 28, 2009, drummer James ""The Rev"" Sullivan was found dead at his home at the age of 28. Autopsy results were inconclusive, but on June 9, 2010, the cause of death was revealed to have been an ""acute polydrug intoxication due to combined effects of Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Diazepam/Nordiazepam and ethanol"". In a statement by the band, they expressed their grief over the passing of The Rev and later posted a message from Sullivan's family which expressed their gratitude to his fans for their support.

he band members admitted in a number of interviews that they considered disbanding at this point of time. However, on February 17, 2010, Avenged Sevenfold stated that they had entered the studio, along with now-former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, to drum for the record, in place of the Rev.

The single ""Nightmare"" was digitally released on May 18, 2010. A preview for the song was released on May 6, 2010 on Amazon.com, but was removed soon after for unknown reasons. Mixing for the album had been completed in New York City, and Nightmare was finally released worldwide on July 27, 2010. It met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics but was well received by the fans. Nightmare beat sales projections easily, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of 163,000 units in its first week.[45] After finishing recording, in December, Portnoy and the band posted simultaneous statements on their websites stating that he will not be their replacement for The Rev. However, Portnoy did travel with the band overseas in December 2010 for three shows in Iraq and Kuwait sponsored by the USO. They played for US Soldiers at Camp Adder, Camp Beuhring, and Balad Air Base. On January 20, 2011, Avenged Sevenfold announced via Facebook that former Confide drummer Arin Ilejay will tour with them starting this year. Whether or not he will be joining the band on a permanent basis has not been decided yet.

Avenged Sevenfold performed at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals on June 3–5, 2011 alongside other bands such as Alter Bridge, System of a Down, and In Flames. On April 2011, the band headlined the Golden God Awards held by Metal Hammer. The same night the band won three awards for ""Best Vocalist"" (M. Shadows), ""Epiphone Best Guitarist(s)"" (Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance) and ""Affliction’s Album of The Year: "" for Nightmare, while Mike Portnoy won the award for ""Drum Workshop’s Best Drummer"" for his work on the album.

In May 2011, it was confirmed that the band had written a new song to be included in the Escalation DLC pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops. The song is the first time developers Treyarch have commissioned an outside band to contribute a song since the franchise began. The song, titled ""Not Ready to Die"", was released on iTunes on May 2, 2011.

Avenged Sevenfold headlined the 2011 Uproar Festival with supporting acts Three Days Grace, Seether, Bullet For My Valentine, Escape The Fate, among others. In August 2011, vocalist M. Shadows stated the band would finish the Uproar Festival, then go home to take a break for six to seven months before starting a new record. He also roughly stated that Arin Ilejay and the band are getting along great, but that they have to make sure he's comfortable writing music with them, but also that he hopes everything works out.

In November and December, 2011, the band went on their ""Buried Alive"" tour with supporting acts Hollywood Undead, Asking Alexandria, and Black Veil Brides.

The band will be touring through Asia into April and early May, and are scheduled play the Orion Music + More Festival on June 23 and 24 in Atlantic City, New Jersey alongside Metallica and Cage the Elephant among many others.

Niall Horan,"Niall James Horan, known simply as Niall Horan (born 13th September 1993), is a singer-songwriter and musician from Mullingar, Ireland. He is a member of four-piece (former five) boyband, One Direction (formed in 2010). Before he competed in the UK and Ireland singing competition ""The X Factor"", he played numerous gigs around the country including as a support act for Lloyd Daniels (in Dublin). 

He then took up the challenge of applying to the X Factor 2010 whereby he entered as a solo artist. His first audition infront of judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, Cheryl Cole and guest judge Katy Perry didn't fair too well as he gave them his rendition of Ne-yo's ""So Sick"". Louis, Simon and Katy all put Niall through as they saw something special in him. However, Cole wasn't as impressed. He was set on proving her wrong.

In boot camp, he was put into a boyband named ""One Direction"". The other members are 4 British lads: Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne.

He has gotten numerous solo's throughout the competition in songs such as ""Kids In America"" and ""Viva La Vida"", and ""All You Need Is Love"".

One Direction finished third.

Simon Cowell did not hesitate to sign them to his label SYCO. They released a book titled ""Forever Young"", which went on to become a Sunday Times bestseller.

Niall and his bandmates' first single release ""What Makes You Beautiful"" made it straight to number 1 in the Irish and UK charts.

Interpol,"Interpol is a post-punk band based in New York City, United States, that took an important part in the post-punk revival of the 2000s. The band consists of Paul Banks (vocals and guitar), Sam Fogarino (drums), and Daniel Kessler (guitar and backing vocals).

The band's sound is generally a mix of staccato bass and rhythmic, harmonized guitar, with a snare heavy mix, drawing comparisons to post-punk bands such as Joy Division and The Chameleons.

The band formed in 1997 when Daniel Kessler met drummer Greg Drudy, previously a member of post-hardcore/screamo band Joshua Fit For Battle and Hot Cross, on the New York University campus. Kessler later added Carlos D. on the bass after meeting him in a history class. The line-up was complete after Kessler ran into Paul Banks, a friend whom he had met in Paris. In 2000, Sam Fogarino, whom the band knew through his job at a local record store, replaced Drudy. Carlos Dengler, who was responsible for bass and keyboards, left the band in 2010, and hasn't been replaced, but announced various names to help them perform live.

The band released Direction on the soundtrack of the television program 'Six Feet Under' on June 28, 2005.  Shortly thereafter they left Matador for a major label.

Our Love to Admire was released on July 10, 2007 in the USA (July 9 in the UK) to generally favorable reviews.  The Heinrich Maneuver was its first single.

Their self-titled LP was released on September 7th 2010 and the tracks Barricade , Summer Well , Lights , and Try It On have been issued as singles. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Interpol"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Beastie Boys,"Beastie Boys were an American hip-hop trio from New York City, United States: Brooklyn and Manhattan. Originally formed as a four-piece hardcore punk band, The Young Aborigines, in 1978 by Michael Diamond (vocals), John Berry (guitar; died May 2016), Adam Yauch (bass) and Kate Schellenbach (drums), for the majority of its career the group consisted of Mike D (real name Michael Diamond),  Ad-Rock (Adam Horovitz) and, until his death in May 2012, MCA (Adam Yauch). 

The Beastie Boys were the first successful white rap group and one of the few acts from the early days of hip-hop that still enjoyed major success their whole career Their rock and punk-influenced rap has had a significant impact on artists both in and outside the hip-hop scene, and they were the first rap group to gain a substantial following with alternative rock fans.

The Beastie Boys came together in 1979 as a punk band called The Young Aboriginies. In 1981 MCA joined the group and from the suggestion of their guitarist John Berry, they changed their name to Beastie Boys. Their line up then consisted of Adam Yauch (aka MCA) on bass, drummer Kate Schellenbach (later of Luscious Jackson), guitarist John Berry (of Big Fat Love), and Mike Diamond (aka Mike D) on the mic. Beastie Boys' debut EP, the Pollywog Stew vinyl 7"" was released in 1982. 

The band's first foray into hip hop, the Cooky Puss 12"", followed in 1983, with The Young and the Useless guitarist Adam Horovitz (aka Adrock) replacing John Berry. ""Cooky Puss"" would be the first B Boys record to receive play at NYC clubs like Danceteria as the band played its first shows outside the city.

The Mike D/MCA/Adrock Beastie Boys lineup debuted in 1984 with the ""Rock Hard""/""Beastie Groove"" 12."" Produced by Rick Rubin, who went on to produce albums for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Johnny Cash and Audioslave. The ""She's On It""/ ""Slow And Low"" 12"" followed in 1985 and Beastie Boys went on Madonna's ""Virgin Tour."" as her opening act.

Licensed to Ill dropped in fall 1986 and became the first Beastie Boys album--and the first Rap album ever--to go #1. Fueled by Fight for Your Right and No Sleep Till Brooklyn it remained at #1 for seven weeks and simultaneously reached #2 on the urban chart, becoming the fastest selling debut to date for Columbia and the first hip hop record to break 5 million.

In 1989 Beastie Boys released their second album Paul’s Boutique produced by Beastie Boys and the Dust Brothers. Paul's Boutique laid down the blueprint for a generation of emergent genres and went over the collective head of a nation. The likes of ""Shake Your Rump,"" ""Lookin' Down The Barrel Of A Gun,"" ""Car Thief,"" Shadrach,"" and the hip hop ""suite"" ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" contained lyrical and musical references too plentiful and diverse for the average mind to compute in one sitting. 

Check Your Head, released in 1992, heralded the return of live instrumentation into the B Boys mix. The album was produced by the band and Mario Caldato Jr. (who first worked with B Boys as engineer on Paul's Boutique), Check Your Head would yield a watershed of new B Boys staples, including So Whatcha' Want, Pass The Mic, ""Gratitude"" and ""Jimmy James."" With the assistance of Keyboard Money Mark, Eric Bobo and assorted percussionists, Beastie Boys returned to the touring circuit and Check Your Head hit double platinum.

In the summer of 1994, Ill Communication, also produced by the band and Mario Caldato Jr., entered the charts #1.  The album featured such hits Sure Shot and Sabotage. Ill Communication was supported by Beastie Boys' first arena headline tour since the '80s. Following the tour's conclusion, Beastie Boys recorded and released Aglio e Olio consisting of eight songs clocking in at 11 minutes, the EP recalls the vintage hardcore punk of the band's infancy. 

On July 14 1998, their fifth album titled Hello Nasty was released. Spurred by the monster success of the ""Intergalactic"" single and video, the record clocked first week sales of nearly 700,000 in the U.S. and went straight in at #1 in England, Germany, Australia, Holland, New Zealand and Sweden. Early in the tour, Beastie Boys made live tracks available for free download to fans unable to attend the shows-and were blindsided by their label pulling the tracks down. 

Having closed 1998 by accepting the Video Vanguard lifetime achievement honor at the MTV Video Music Awards, Beastie Boys rang in 1999 with Artist, Band and/or Record of the Year accolades from the likes of Rolling Stone, SPIN, The New Yorker and Playboy, among others. A month later, at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, the now quadruple-platinum Hello Nasty took Best Alternative Music Performance, while ""Intergalactic,"" nailed Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group--the first time an artist has ever won in both Rap and Alternative categories.1999 would also see ""Intergalactic"" take Best Hip Hop Video honors at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards.

Beastie Boys' sixth studio album, To The 5 Boroughs, released in summer 2004, was the band's third consecutive #1 debut-and Rolling Stone magazine's only 5-star review of the year. To The 5 Boroughs was supported by world tour - traveling pageant - supported by Talib Kweli and Bob Moore's Amazing Mongrels (yes, a live dog show, hence the pageant appellation).

2006 saw the release of the film, Awesome, I Fuckin' Shot That!, a concert film made up of footage filmed by audience members, which debuted at Sundance in early 2006 and was released theatrically the same year.

In 2007 Beastie Boys released The Mix-Up, first ever full length offering of all-new, all-original instrumental recordings. 

On February 3rd, 2009, they digitally remastered and released Paul's Boutique on their website.

The band's next record, ""Hot Sauce Committee Part 2"" was released in the first quarter of 2011. It features the same tracklisting as the previously announced ""Hot Sauce Committee Part 1"", which was delayed indefinitely after Yauch was diagnosed with a tumor on his parotid gland (which was successfully removed).

Bassist and vocalist Adam Yauch died on May 4, 2012 of cancer. 

In June 2014, Mike D stated that the Beastie Boys would not continue their careers as a group, as a promise to Adam Yauch. ""We have not been able to tour since MCA, Adam Yauch, died,"" Diamond said. ""We can't make new music."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Beastie+Boys"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ben Howard,"Ben Howard (born 24 April 1987) is an English singer-songwriter, born in London. He moved to Totnes, Devon, in his teens. Howard's musically-inclined parents exposed him at a young age to their favourite records from singer-songwriter artists such as Bob Dylan, Nina Simone and John Martyn.  Howard began writing his own songs and after a short spell studying journalism, he decided in 2009 at the age of 21 to become a full-time musician. 

After building up a reputation with his gigs across the UK, Howard was eventually asked to sign to Island Records. His first album, Every Kingdom, was released on October 3, 2011 and debuted at #7 on the UK album chart. It sold in excess of 1 million copies globally, received a Mercury Music Prize nomination, and was the catalyst for Ben picking up two Brit Awards in 2012 for British Breakthrough and British Solo Male Artist.  

The follow up, 'I Forget Where We Were' was released on 20th October 2014 through Island Records. It was produced by Ben and his drummer Chris Bond at Start Point Farm Studios in Devon.

The Cranberries,"The Cranberries is an alternative rock band from Limerick, Ireland that formed in 1989 and rose to mainstream popularity in the early 1990's. The band consists of Dolores O'Riordan (vocals, keyboards, guitars), Noel Hogan (guitars, vocals, also a member of Mono Band), Mike Hogan (bass, vocals), and Fergal Lawler (drums, percussion, also a member of The Low Network). The band went on hiatus in 2003 and reunited in the summer of 2009.

Combining the melodic jangle of post-The Smiths indie pop with the lilting, trance-inducing sonic textures of late-80s dream pop and adding a slight Celtic tint, The Cranberries became one of the more successful groups to emerge from the indie scene of the early 90s. Led by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice is the most distinctive element of the group's sound, the group initially made little impact in the United Kingdom. 

It wasn't until the lush ballad ""Linger"" became an American hit in 1993 that the band also achieved mass success in the U.K. Following the success of ""Linger"", The Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles like ""Dreams"", ""Zombie"" and ""Ode to My Family"". 

By the time of their third album, 1996's To the Faithful Departed, the group had added distorted guitars to its sonic palette and attempted to make more socially significant music, which resulted in a downturn in the band's commercial fortunes.

During the next few years, the band cancelled a large tour and rumours of a breakup were widespread. In 1999, they released Bury the Hatchet to mixed reviews. In 2001, the band issued Wake Up and Smell the Coffee to rave reviews. The album debuted at number 46 in the US charts. 

In 2002, The Cranberries released the compilation Stars: The Best of 1992-2002, which was supported by the single ""Stars"".

In 2003, The Cranberries announced they were taking some time to pursue individual careers. They decided to put the next album on hold. After more than a dozen years of relentless touring and promotion, which had seen them clocking up album sales in excess of 43 million and playing to hundreds of thousands of fans around the globe, the band decided it was time for a break.

In 2007, Dolores O'Riordan released her debut solo album titled Are You Listening?. Two years later she released her second solo album, No Baggage.

On 25 August 2009, Dolores O'Riordan announced that The Cranberries will be reuniting for a North American tour to begin in mid-November 2009, to be followed by dates in Europe in early 2010. O'Riordan indicated that the band will be playing songs from her solo albums and a lot of The Cranberries classic hits as well as some new music written by the group together.

The Cranberries recorded Roses at the Metalworks Studios in Toronto (Canada) from 18 April to 15 May 2011 with producer Stephen Street, who previously collaborated with the band on first, second and fifth albums. The Cranberries worked on 15 tracks during the Roses session, although not all will be included on the album. The album is scheduled for release on 14 February, 2012.

The Chemical Brothers,"The Chemical Brothers are a British electronic music duo comprising Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons, who met at the University of Manchester, England, United Kingdom in 1992. Initially they called themselves ""The Dust Brothers.""  They changed their name in 1995 given the preexisting American production duo ""The Dust Brothers,"" their burgeoning popularity and the threat of legal action from the originals. Thus, their first album as The Chemical Brothers was titled Exit Planet Dust.  

Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, Underworld, Orbital, Apollo 440 and a few other less-known acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat electronic dance genre to the forefront of pop culture.  They are known for their high-quality DJ sets, an example of which can be found on their album Brothers Gonna Work It Out.

Many of their tracks have been in the UK charts as well as those in other countries. Wide belief is that their best album is ""Surrender"" however ""Dig Your Own Hole"" is considered their masterwork by a significant number of Chemical Brother connoisseurs and they are known for producing a style which evolves greatly between albums.  

Their song, Galvanize, was featured in Budweiser TV commercials in the U.S. giving it a great degree of exposure and popularity.

They composed the original soundtrack for the feature film Hanna.

Songfacts reports that ""Theme From Velodrome"" was one of five official tracks selected by the Olympic committee to soundtrack the London 2012 Games. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Chemical+Brothers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Snoop Dogg,"Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr. (born October 20, 1971 in Long Beach, California, United States), better known by his stage name Snoop Dogg, is a Grammy award nominated rapper, producer and actor. Snoop is best known as a famous MC in the West Coast hip hop scene, and for being one of producer Dr. Dre's most notable protégés. He made his rap debut in 1992 on Dre's debut album The Chronic, and then released his debut album, Doggystyle, to much critical and public acclaim. His mother nicknamed him ""Snoopy"" as a child, and he took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg when he began recording. He changed his name to Snoop Dogg in 1996 when he left his original record label, Death Row Records, and signed with No Limit Records.  

He has been affiliated with the Crips, a U.S. street gang. Several of his cousins, including RBX, Nate Dogg, Daz Dillinger, and Warren G are also hip hop artists and often collaborate with Snoop. In 2000, Snoop (as ""Michael J. Corleone"") directed Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle, a pornographic film produced by Hustler. This film, combining hip-hop with X-rated material, was a huge success and won ""Top Selling Release of the Year"" at the 2002 AVN Awards. Driven by this success, Snoop directed Snoop Dogg's Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp in 2002 (this time using the nickname ""Snoop Scorsese"").

As a rapper, he is perhaps best known for his “lazy drawl” — a slurred, distinctively calm, laid-back, and rhythmically-complex lyrical delivery.  His lyrics have often been criticized for their glorification of misogyny, violence and gangsterism; however, he is often credited for accurately portraying street slang and attitudes.

Frank Sinatra,"Francis Albert Sinatra (born December 12, 1915 in Hoboken, New Jersey; died May 14, 1998 in Los Angeles, California) was an Italian American Grammy Award winning jazz singer, Academy Award winning actor, founder of Reprise Records and member of The Rat Pack. Beginning his musical career in the Swing Era along with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra became a highly successful solo artist, releasing 59 studio albums and becoming the idol of the 'bobby soxers'.

His professional career had stalled by the 1950s, but it was reborn in 1954 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums (such as In the Wee Small Hours, Songs For Swingin' Lovers, Come Fly With Me, Only the Lonely and Nice 'n' Easy). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records (finding success with albums such as Ring-A-Ding-Ding, Sinatra at the Sands and Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim), toured internationally, and fraternized with the Rat Pack and President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s. Sinatra turned fifty in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My Years, and scored hits with ""Strangers in the Night"" and ""My Way"". Sinatra attempted to weather the changing tastes in popular music, but with dwindling album sales and after appearing in several poorly received films, he retired in 1971. Coming out of retirement in 1973, he recorded several albums, scoring a hit with ""(Theme From) New York, New York"", and toured both within the United States and internationally until a few years before his death in 1998.

Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey and had three children; Nancy, Frank Jr. and Tina by his first wife Nancy Barbato. He was married three more times, to the actresses Ava Gardner and Mia Farrow and finally to Barbara Marx, to whom he was married at his death.

Sinatra is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. One of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century, Sinatra had a popularity that was later matched only by Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson. American music critic Robert Christgau called him ""the greatest singer of the 20th century"".

Air,"There are at least seven artists with this name:
1. A popular electronic music duo from France
2. A jazz trio from the United States
3. A noise rock band from Japan
4. An alias of ambient musician Pete Namlook
5. An alternative pop band from Indonesia
6. A pop group from the Philippines 
7. A french synth-pop band also known as Air 89

1) The French band Air is a duo consisting of Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoit Dunckel. They went to school in Versailles, (Lycée Jules Ferry) before forming the band in 1995. Their critically acclaimed first album Premiers Symptômes was followed by the release of Moon Safari, The Virgin Suicides (soundtrack), 10,000Hz Legend, and Talkie Walkie. In 2007, Air released the album Pocket Symphony and Love 2 in 2009. The Seven Stars Songfacts reports that Air was commissioned to write a new soundtrack for the premiere of the newly restored Georges Méliès' silent film, Le Voyage Dans La Lune, at the 2011 Cannes film festival. Despite Méliès' film only having a runtime of 14 minutes, Air still produced enough music to fill an entire album, which will be released as their seventh LP on February 7, 2012.

Although Air's music is often referred to as electronica or trip-hop and is often found in such bins in record stores, their form of electronic music actually owes more to the synthesizer sounds of the 1970s such as Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis. Other influences that are more readily apparent than house and techno are psychedelic rock pioneers Pink Floyd and Krautrockers Tangerine Dream (although there are some echoes of dance music styles in the production). Another influence is French crooner Serge Gainsbourg. Air's music also has jazz inflections at times, and their ability to improvise is more clearly highlighted in the live arena. Before they founded Air, JB and Nicolas played together in the band Orange, with others such as Alex Gopher, Xavier Jamaux and Etienne de Crecy names which have recently reappeared in connection with Air's remixes. The name stands for ""Amour, Imagination, Rêve"", which translates to Love, Imagination, Dream.

Air uses many of their studio instruments (like Moog synthesizers, the Korg MS20, Wurlitzer and Vocoder) live on stage. The band performs the well-known tracks from the albums live as extended or altered versions. Air often works together, both in the studio and live on stage, with artists like Beth Hirsch (Moon Safari), Françoise Hardy (""Jeanne""), Jean-Jaques Perrey (""Cosmic Bird""), Gordon Tracks (""Playground Love"" and ""Easy Going Woman""), Beck (10,000Hz Legend) and, on the 2004 tour, with Dave Palmer and drummer Earl Harvin. On their 2007 album ""Pocket Symphony"", more guest writer and vocalist appearances were made by Jarvis Cocker and Neil Hannon (of The Divine Comedy. For the 2007 tour that accompanied the record, the band consisted of Earl Harvin on drums, multi-instrumentalist Steve Jones (steviejjones) and French keyboard player Vincent Taurelle.

Their music has also frequently been used in commercials. ""Surfing on a Rocket"" is the background music for the Nissan Armada commercial (2005). ""Playground Love"" was used in a Levi's jeans commercial (2002). A number of their songs are used as the background music for the BBC 2 show ""Top Gear"" in their films about exotic sports cars.

They recently contributed to Charlotte Gainsbourg's second album, ""5:55"".

2) Air was a jazz trio with its roots steeped in Chicago's Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), and was formed originally in 1971 or 1972.

The jazz trio Air formed from within the Muhal Richard Abrams Sextet, which was active on the Chicago scene contemporaneously with the birth and growth of the AACM and groups such as the Art Ensemble of Chicago. Henry Threadgill on reeds, hubcaphone, and percussion; Fred Hopkins on bass, and Steve McCall on drums formed the trio when Threadgill was commissioned by Columbia College to score and adapt Scott Joplin's work for a performance honoring Joplin's centenary (Joplin's birth has been established now as sometime in 1868) and a rebirth of interest in the noted ragtime composer. All three men were Air signs in the zodiac, and so adopted the name.

They performed first around Chicago, while maintaining residency with Muhal Abrams group, which also featured Kalaparusha Maurice McIntyre and Wallace McMillan, both reed players. The Air ""brand"" remained a side project until all three reunited in New York in 1975, and began recording under that name for India Navigation, Nessa, Black Saint, and Novus. The trio broke up when Steve McCall left in the early 1980s, and when Pheroan Aklaff joined in 1982, they recorded as New Air, and recorded several albums under that name, including Air Show No. 1 in 1986, which featured Cassandra Wilson on vocals. Andrew Cyrille ultimately replaced akLaff before the band eventually was superceded by the burgeoning careers of its members: Threadgill with his groups Sextett and Very Very Circus, and Hopkins as the go-to bassist for Threadgill, David Murray, and Hamiet Bluiett. McCall's health forced his retirement from touring around 1980, and the dynamic drummer and effusive and gracious man who was a cofounder of the AACM with Muhal Abrams and Fred Anderson, died of a stroke in 1989.

This Air is listed as Air (4) on Discogs and is also been identified on last.fm as Air (Fred Hopkins, Steve McCall, Henry Threadgill) and Air with Fred Hopkins, Steve Mccall, Henry Threadgill (sic: McCall's name misspelt), and possibly also other alternative spellings of the group's name exist.

3) Japanese noise rock, Air is an alias of Koji Kurumatani.

4) Air is one of the many aliases of Pete Namlook. He has been releasing ambient music under this name since the release of an eponymous album in 1993.

5) Air is an Indonesian Pop band that became popular with their ""Bintang"" song

7) Air/Air 89 were a French New Wave, Synth-Pop trio founded in 1983.

Featuring the leader/frontwoman Claudie Fritsch-Mentrop alias Desireless (vocal), Fred Milgram (bass), Miguel Perchey de Oliveira (guitars) and the songwriter/producer Jean-Michel Rivat.

Released singles : Cherchez l'amour fou / À l'arrière de la Cadillac (1984) as Air89, Qui peut savoir / Star (1986) as Air.
Claudie left the band to pursue a solo career in 1986.

Iron & Wine,
Evanescence,"Evanescence is a Grammy-winning band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States in 1995 by singer/pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody (who left in 2003). 

After recording private albums, the band signed to Wind-up Records and released their first full-length album, Fallen, in 2003, which sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and helped the band win two Grammy Awards. A year later, they released their first live album, Anywhere But Home, which sold more than one million copies worldwide. In 2006, they then released their second studio album, The Open Door, which sold more than five million copies. They released their third and latest studio album, Evanescence in 2011.

The band currently consists of Amy Lee (lead vocals, piano, keyboards), Terry Balsamo (guitars), and Tim McCord (bass). Former members include David Hodges (piano, keyboards, backing vocals; left in 2002), Ben Moody (guitars; left in 2003), William Boyd (bass; left in 2006), John LeCompt (guitars, backing vocals; fired in 2007), and Rocky Gray (drums; left in 2007). Session members include Troy McLawhorn (guitars) and Will Hunt (drums), both are from Dark New Day, they were ""borrowed"" to replace LeCompt and Gray during 2007 tours.

Amy Lee and Ben Moody met in 1994 at a youth camp in Little Rock, where Moody heard Lee playing I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That) by Meat Loaf on the piano. Their first songs were Solitude and Give Unto Me, written by Lee, and Understanding and My Immortal, written by Moody.

Two of Lee and Moody's songs found playtime on local radio stations, raising local awareness of the group and demand for a show. The band eventually appeared live, and became one of the most popular acts in the area. After experimenting with band names, such as Childish Intentions and Stricken, they decided on Evanescence, which means ""disappearance"" or ""fading away"" (from the word evanesce, which means ""to disappear""). Lee has stated she loves the name because ""it is mysterious and dark, and places a picture in the listeners' mind."".

Their first full-length demo CD, Origin (released in 2000), is relatively unknown. The band also released two EPs. First, the self-titled Evanescence EP (1998) of which about 100 copies were made, and second the Sound Asleep EP, also known as the Whisper EP (1999), limited to 50 copies. Origin and the EPs contain demo versions of some of the songs on their debut album, Fallen. For example, the recording of My Immortal found on Fallen can also be found on Origin, minus a handful of additional string accompaniments. Only 2,500 copies of this record were produced; in response, Lee and Moody encouraged fans to download the band's older songs from the Internet.

In several interviews Amy has said that 'Origin' was not an album, it was merely meant to be a demo. While appearing to be an official CD, it was never meant to be officially released.  According to Amy Lee ""Origin is not an album.  Should I say that clearer?  'Origin' is not an album.  We recorded its demos, we recorded it a long time ago, in Ben's apartment or in my parent's attic with an 8-track recorder that cost $300.  It sounds like crap. Don't feel bad that you don't have it, just download it.  It looks kind of like an album because we had an artist make us this cool album cover because we were shopping it to record labels.  We put everything we had on there, and some songs that are on there are on 'Fallen', just done right"". The video of this interview can be seen here.

The band sent 'Origin' to several record labels, and eventually Wind-Up Records signed them. The band then recorded a large collection of demos throughout 2001 and 2002. Afterwards, the band began work on their second full-length album. However, after the album had been finished, Hodges left the band in December of 2002.

The album, entitled 'Fallen', was then released in March 2003. It brought the band international fame, selling 14 millions of copies worldwide. 'Fallen' has since gone 6 times platinum in the United States and has sold more than 15 million copies altogether worldwide.

However, shortly after, Moody left the band on October 22 of 2003 due to internal struggles with the band members. He was then replaced by guitarist Terry Balsamo from the band Cold. Before Moody's departure, Gray, LeCompt, and Boyd had been session members, but afterwards they became full-time members.

At the 2004 Grammy Awards, Evanescence won Best New Artist and Best Hard Rock Performance for their single Bring Me to Life, known worldwide from the Daredevil soundtrack. That same year, the band released a live CD/DVD entitled 'Anywhere But Home', which also sold 1 million of copies worldwide and has since gone platinum in the United States.

Afterwards, the band began work on their next release. Many things set the release back, including the health problems of Terry. He was unfortunately affected by a stroke, but is recovering successfully. Amy also fired their old manager which they had relations with during 'Fallen', and brought him to court. In 2006, they finished recording their second album, titled 'The Open Door', as well as shooting a video for the single Call Me When You're Sober. On July 13th, 2006, Lee announced through Evanescence's online message board that bassist Boyd has decided to leave the band in order to make time for his personal life and family. Tim McCord was announced as Will Boyd's replacement in August 2006.

'The Open Door' debuted at number 1 in Australia, United States, Greece, Germany, and Switzerland. It sold over 1 million copies worldwide within the first week of its release.

The second single of 'The Open Door' was Lithium. A video was shot for the single - directed by Paul Fedor (who has worked with Marilyn Manson, Seether, and Deftones). It took 2 days to film, October 31 and November 1, 2006.

The third single off 'The Open Door' was Sweet Sacrifice.  The label, Wind-Up, had originally chosen All That I'm Living For to be the third single, but was met with opposition from the fans.  The video was shot on March 9th and 10th, 2007.  Directed by Paul Brown.

On May 4, 2007, John LeCompt announced that he had been fired from Evanescence, and also stated that drummer Rocky Gray had decided to quit as well. Both musicians posted on their personal MySpace pages to confirm the news report, however, neither elaborated about the circumstances surrounding their departures, and no official statement has yet been released by the band or label.

On his MySpace blog, LeCompt stated that Lee called his cellphone to fire him, and that no warning had previously been given nor were any negotiations made available. No replacements have been named as of yet, but Evanescence says they will continue touring and producing music.

Lee revealed during the taping of MuchMusic's January 9, 2007 episode of Live @ Much that she had become engaged the previous evening. She later confirmed on EvThreads.com that she was proposed to by Josh Hartzler, a 29-year-old therapist and long time friend. She noted in an interview that the songs Good Enough and Bring Me To Life were inspired by him. The couple were married on May 6, 2007, and honeymooned near The Bahamas. She has posted on EvThreads that she is ""now officially Mrs. Amy Hartzler.""

Recently Lee and Evanescence (with temporary members) headlined a one off show in Sao Paulo, Brazil for a music festival. A couple of weeks before, Lee posted on her Twitter that the band need to practice and was going to play a secret show in NYC's The Palace.

 Lee confirmed that a third album was on the way and was set to release late 2010. A short video surfaced on one members Twitter account showing the band practicing and recording.

On 22 January, 2010, Amy posted on her Twitter that the b-side Together Again would be a gift to all who donate just the minimum amount to the Relief Effort over in Haiti.

In a MTV interview Amy Lee announced that the new album would be named 'Evanescence'. This was released October 11th, 2011. It is the first of their albums to have a deluxe version with 4 extra songs and an accompanying DVD.

Hans Zimmer,"Hans Florian Zimmer (born September 12, 1957) is a German film composer and music producer, born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany and active since 1977. Having won a wide variety of honors and commendations, he has composed music for over 100 films, including award-winning films and box-office hits such as Rain Man (1988), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), Thelma & Louise (1991), The Lion King (1994), Crimson Tide (1995), Gladiator (2000), The Last Samurai (2003), The Dark Knight (2008), Inception (2010), 12 Years a Slave (2013) and Interstellar (2014). A recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Zimmer spent the early part of his career in the United Kingdom before moving to the United States. He's also the head of the film music division at DreamWorks studios and additionally works with other composers through the company that he founded: Remote Control Productions.

Zimmer's works are notable for integrating electronic music sounds with traditional orchestral arrangements. He has received four Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, a Classical BRIT Award, and an Academy Award. He was also named on the list of Top 100 Living Geniuses published by The Daily Telegraph.

Zimmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany on 12th September 1957, and moved to London as a teenager. While he lived in London, Zimmer wrote advertising jingles for Air-Edel Associates. Zimmer began his musical career playing keyboards and synthesisers. In 1980 he worked with The Buggles, a New Wave band formed in 1977 with Trevor Horn, Geoff Downs, and Bruce Woolley. Zimmer can be briefly seen in The Buggles music video for ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" (1979). 

In the 1980s, Zimmer worked with film composer Stanley Myers, a prolific film composer who composed scores for over sixty films. Zimmer and Myers co-founded the London-based Lillie Yard recording studio. Together, Myers and Zimmer worked on fusing the traditional orchestral sound with state-of-the-art electronics. Some of their first movies with this new sound include ""Moonlighting"" (1982), ""Success is the Best Revenge"" (1984), ""Insignificance"" (1985), and ""My Beautiful Launderette"" (1985). In 1986, Zimmer joined David Byrne and Ryuichi Sakamoto on their Oscar-winning score for ""The Last Emperor"" (1988).

Soon afterwards, Zimmer began working on his own solo projects. During his solo career years, Zimmer experimented and combined the use of old and new musical technologies. His first solo score was for Chris Menges’s film ""A World Apart"" (1988). However, the turning point in his career came later that year when he was asked to compose a score for Barry Levinson’s film ""Rain Man"" (1988). In the score, Zimmer uses synthesizers mixed with steel drums. The score was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989. A year later Zimmer was asked to compose a score for Bruce Beresford's ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989), which won a Grammy Award 1991.

In 1994, Zimmer won his biggest commercial hit for Disney’s ""The Lion King"" (1994). He wanted to go to South Africa himself to record the soundtrack, but couldn't because he had a police record there for making subversive films. ""The Lion King"" soundtrack won numerous awards, including an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and two Grammys. It was then adapted for the Broadway musical version, which won the Tony for Best Musical in 1998.

Since the success of ""The Lion King"", Zimmer has written numerous film scores. His hundredth composition was for ""The Last Samurai"" (2003), for which he won both a Golden Globe and a Broadcast Film Critics nomination in 2004. After composing over a hundred film scores, Zimmer finally performed live for the first time in concert with a hundred-piece orchestra and a hundred-person choir at the twenty-seventh Annual Flanders International Film Festival. 

He has received numerous honours and awards, including: Prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award in Film Composition from the National Board of Review, Frederick Loewe Award in 2003 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, ASCAP’s Henry Mancini Award for Lifetime Achievement, and BMI's prestigious Richard Kirk Award for lifetime achievement in 1996. Today, Zimmer is considered to be the father of integrating the electronic musical world with traditional orchestral arrangements.

Limp Bizkit,"Limp Bizkit is an American nu metal band from Jacksonville, Florida. The band's line-up consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Wes Borland (guitar), Sam Rivers (bass), John Otto (drums) and DJ Lethal. Limp Bizkit has been nominated for three Grammy Awards and have won several other major awards. The band has sold an estimated 35 million albums worldwide.

The album sold 1.05 million copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever, breaking the record held for 7 years by Pearl Jam's Vs.

Mike Smith was brought in as a replacement guitarist, following the departure of Wes Borland in 2001, for the fourth studio album, Results May Vary, released in 2003. Borland rejoined the band in 2004 for the release of an EP, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) but departed again. He rejoined the band in February 2009. With Borland, Limp Bizkit recorded their first full length album with their original line-up in ten years, Gold Cobra.


Formation and early years (1995-1996)

Limp Bizkit was founded in 1995 in Jacksonville, after Fred Durst met Sam Rivers. Rivers introduced Durst to his cousin, John Otto, a drummer in Keystone Heights, FL. The three got together for a jam session, and soon after started an early version of the band. The trio soon recruited guitarist Rob Waters and Limp Bizkit was established.[3] The band's first four-track demo, entitled Mental Aquaducts (which were remakes of previously written songs from Fred's previous bands Split 26 and 10Ft Shindig), was recorded with Rob Waters but soon after he left the band. Otto suggested the group to consider Wes Borland, whom he had gone to school with, for the now vacant position. Durst noticed him playing in clubs and wanted to recruit him. Durst went to Philadelphia, and he instructed the other members to talk to Wes and see if he'd join the band. Wes accepted, and the very night Fred came back to Jacksonville, a show was scheduled. Fred and Wes met for the first time, practiced for a half hour, and then went and played the show.

The band continued to play various shows, their most popular venue being at the Milkbar in Jacksonville. In 1995, Fred Durst met and talked to members of the band Korn when they played a show in the Jacksonville area. Durst, a tattoo artist, gave Korn bassist Reginald ""Fieldy"" Arvizu several tattoos and the two became friends. Durst gave Korn the band's first demo tape with Rob Waters, and they shrugged it off as nothing special. Later, with Borland, a second demo was recorded and this time Korn were impressed. The demo included the tracks ""Counterfeit"", ""Stuck"", ""Stalemate"", and ""Pollution"", all of which would end up on the band's debut album Three Dollar Bill, Yall$. The demo tape was passed onto Ross Robinson, who produced for Korn, and he was also impressed. Ross contacted Limp Bizkit, and stated his intent to produce for the band. At a Garbage concert, Durst had met Jordan Schur and played his demo tape for him in Schur's car. He was impressed, and wanted to sign Limp Bizkit to his label, Flip Records. Around this time, the band was booked to tour with the bands Deftones and House of Pain, whose member DJ Lethal later joined Limp Bizkit. Limp Bizkit later signed with Mojo Records, but were later bought out by Schur and subsequently signed with Flip Records.


Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ (1997–1998)

The band's first full length recording, Three Dollar Bill, Yall$, was released in 1997 on Interscope. The album fared poorly on the Billboard 200 at the time of its release, although it did sell steadily over time due to extensive touring. It wasn't until the Family Values Tour, the Trail of Tears, and Ozzfest, which helped the album to peak at number 22 on the chart. At Ozzfest in particular, the band made a memorable impression on viewers due to the original set they played on, which consisted of a giant toilet. The band climbed out from the toilet at the beginning of the show, with Durst saying lines during the show such as ""We're coming straight to you from the sewer"" and ""I am a piece of shit, and my band is a piece of shit"". Borland's outlandish makeup started making impressions on fans as well. Although their first released single was ""Counterfeit"", they rose to fame through a cover of George Michael's ""Faith"". The song appeared on the soundtrack of Peter Berg's 1998 movie ""Very Bad Things"" starring Cameron Diaz, Christian Slater and Jeremy Piven. Later that year, Fred lent his vocals to Korn's third album on the song All in the Family, a rap-battle of sorts. The album featured a second disc, with four remixes of the demo for the song and multimedia featuring interviews between Durst, Borland and the rest of Korn.

Another unique idea the band came up with was the Ladies Night in Cambodia tour. Fred had noticed that mostly young males went to their concerts, and wanted more women to come, so they let women in for free at this tour. The tour was a huge success, and many more women would appear at their future concerts.


Significant Other (1999–2000)

In 1999, Limp Bizkit found major worldwide success with their second album Significant Other, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 and received mostly positive reviews. The album sold 834,000 copies in its first week and has sold over 16 million copies worldwide. The first single ""Nookie"", was an enormous hit on rock radio, reaching the top 10 in both rock and rap charts. The band followed-up the single with three simultaneously released singles – ""Break Stuff"", ""Re-Arranged"" and ""N 2 Gether Now"" (featuring hip-hop artist Method Man). ""N 2 Gether Now"" has been cited as an example of Fred Durst's attempt to work for unity rather than rivalry between rock and hip-hop, blurring the distinction between the two genres of music. The album features the songs ""Nobody Like You"" with vocals by Jonathan Davis of Korn and Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots and ""No Sex"" with vocals by Aaron Lewis of Staind.

In the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated Woodstock '99 show in front of approximately 200,000 people. Violent action sprang up during and after their performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song ""Break Stuff"". Several sexual assaults that included, but were not limited to, rapes were reported in the aftermath of the concert, with some examples of the latter being caught on tape, resulting in deliberately lit fires and looting when the Red Hot Chili Peppers played the next day. Some have blamed the band for this outbreak, although Fred Durst claimed that none of the instigations he had made at the concert were intended to cause damage.

Along with this episode, controversies involving the band's members began to arise. Durst particularly became involved in feuds with the metal band Slipknot , Ozzy Osbourne's guitarist Zakk Wylde and engaged in physical violence with Creed frontman Scott Stapp. The band feuded with rappers Eminem and Everlast, while Taproot released on their website an answering machine message that Durst had left on their lead singer's phone as ""revenge"" for ending their record company contract with his record label.


Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000–2001)

Fifteen months later, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water was released on October 17, 2000. In an interview with Guitar World, guitarist Wes Borland explained the meaning of the album's strange title. He said that Durst was frequently referred to as an asshole and thus called himself the ""chocolate starfish"". The other line in the album's title, ""hot dog flavored water"" was derived from an inside joke about a gas station the band visited while on the road and witnessed varieties of flavored water on display. The album set a record for highest week-one sales of a rock album with just over one million copies sold in the U.S. in its first week of release, with 400,000 of those sales coming at its first day of release. ""Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water"" was certified Gold, Platinum and six times Multi-Platinum. The first two singles ""My Generation"" and ""Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)"" were released at the same time in promotion of the album. ""Take a Look Around"" was later added to the list as the theme song to the movie Mission: Impossible 2. A remix, ""Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle)"" featuring Method Man, Redman and DMX was a minor club hit and was featured in the movie The Fast and the Furious. The fourth single ""My Way"" was commissioned as the opening theme for the World Wrestling Federation's WrestleMania X-Seven, and ""Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)"" was used as the entrance music for wrestler ""The Undertaker"" from 2000-2002. The album received mixed reviews from many critics.

Controversy continued with a death during a 2001 tour of Australia at the Big Day Out festival in Sydney. Teenager Jessica Michalik died of asphyxiation when fans rushed the stage in the mosh pit. It was claimed by security and witnesses that Fred Durst was urging the crowd on in a possibly violent manner, and that he failed to attempt to calm the crowd after the accident. Michalik was later rushed to Sydney's Concord Hospital where she died six days later.

Durst provided the courts with testimony. During the hearing he claimed, via a video connection from the U.S., that he had warned the concert's organizers Aaron Jackson, Will Pearce and Amar Tailor and promoter Vivian Lees of the potential dangers of such minimal security, even going so far as to say Limp Bizkit would ""pull out"" if the issue wasn't properly addressed. Big Day Out attorneys attempted to pin the blame on Limp Bizkit because the band did not stop playing when they received news of the incident. Although the guitars, drums and bass ceased, DJ Lethal played a quiet computer-generated loop. While admitting that Lethal took it upon himself to play the interlude, Durst claimed that the quiet melody did have a soothing effect on the crowd.

The Coroner's Court decided that, while the band could have been more helpful in efforts to aid the girl, the security practices employed by festival organizers Creative Entertainment Australia bore the brunt of the blame. After viewing videotapes and hearing witness testimony, however, Milledge, the coroner, said it was evident that the density of the crowd was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage- therefore they had to erect a cage around the band.

In the fall of 2001, Wes Borland left Limp Bizkit for the first time. Strained relations between him and Durst contributed to his decision. His departure was interpreted as a major blow by fans and critics to the band. He was often cited as a vital creative force in the group, due in part to his eccentricity. The last known song the band was working on with Wes was ""Relax"", a semi-cover take on Frankie Goes to Hollywood's song, due to be on the Zoolander soundtrack.


Results May Vary (2002–2004)

With Borland's absence, Limp Bizkit began a nation-wide audition for their new guitarist called Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is in 2002. Durst announced at the outset that he was interested in recruiting a female or more than one new member into the band. Thousands of hopefuls were said entered. Some controversy occurred when rumors surfaced that all contestants were required to sign a document giving Limp Bizkit the full ownership of any riffs they played. Each auditioner was allowed only sixty seconds in the first round. The final contestants were Monte Pittman, Anoush Saboktakin and Jonas Anderson of Fresno, California.

On March 30, 2003, Limp Bizkit performed live for the first time in two years, at World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania XIX. They played ""Crack Addict"" and ""Rollin"" (The Undertaker's theme song) at the show. They signed up for several live tours, despite their lack of a guitarist. It was revealed that the guitarists for the WrestleMania show were Head from Korn and Mike Smith from Snot.

During this time, Durst spoke of many collaborations with guitarists, with a few rap guests sprinkled in on songs for the album. Among them were Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, Page Hamilton of Helmet, Al Jourgensen of Ministry, and Head of Korn as well as Jay-Z, Bubba Sparxxx, and Snoop Dogg. None of the songs with those guitarists would make it onto the album, except ""Build a Bridge"", which was written with Welch, and ""Red Light – Green Light"", which featured Snoop Dogg.

The finalists from the ""Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is"" contest were rejected in favor of former Snot guitarist Mike Smith. The band changed its logo to ""limpbizkit"" to promote their change of style.

The band had already recorded an album's worth of material for an upcoming release. But with Mike Smith now in the band, it was decided that they would go back in the studio and record another album's worth of songs. The best of these tracks would make it onto the final release. Fred refers to the tracks recorded during this period that didn't make it to the album as the 'Off the Record' tracks, as if it were an album in itself.

On September 23, 2003, Results May Vary, their fourth album, debuted at #3 with roughly 320,000 copies sold, breaking the group's #1 spree on the Billboard 200. It received platinum certification (1 million copies sold) in the United States in 2008, almost 5 years after its release. In comparison, their previous work Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water sold more than one million albums in its first week.

The album received almost uniformly poor reviews by critics. Although Rolling Stone's review gave 3 out of 5 stars, Playlouder called it 'fucking crap', and Yahoo! Launch labeled it 'a frightening insight into the vacuous state of 21st century culture'. Nevertheless, an acoustic cover of The Who's ""Behind Blue Eyes"" was a moderate hit on mainstream radio, and its video featured actress Halle Berry. ""Eat You Alive"" was released as the first single off the album, cracking the top 20 of both American rock charts with an accompanying video that features actress Thora Birch being berated and actor Bill Paxton as her father who is looking for her. The album's ballad ""Build a Bridge"" was the official theme song of WWE's Survivor Series pay-per-view event in November 2003, although it was never released as an official single due to Mike Smith's departure. Another song from the album, ""Almost Over"", cracked the Rock Top 40. However it was never released as a single or video.

In 2003, Limp Bizkit toured on the Summer Sanitarium Tour with headliners Metallica, along with Linkin Park, Deftones and Mudvayne to promote Metallica's 2003 release, St. Anger. At the tour's stop in Chicago, IL, attendees of the concert threw items at and heckled Durst from the moment he walked on stage. With the crowd chanting ""Fuck Fred Durst"" and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back.


Borland's second departure, and hiatus (2004–2008)

Throughout July 2004, various rumors began circulating claiming that guitarist Wes Borland had been playing with the band again. By July 8, a fan site released an official report that Borland was recording with the band in London. Photos appeared on the band's official website of him playing with the band, and a live video of them playing a new song ""The Truth"" in studio was posted on the website.

Durst said of Borland's re-entry, ""We are very content with Mike being gone. We are the type of people that stay true to our family and our instincts and at any moment will act on intuition as a whole. Mike wasn't the guy. We had fun playing with him, but always knew, in the back of our minds, that he wasn't where we needed him to be mentally."" At this stage, they reverted back to the use of their original logo.

The band returned to the studio with producer Ross Robinson, who had worked with them on Three Dollar Bill, Yall$, to create a seven track EP titled The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1). Drummer John Otto was only able to contribute to one track on the album due to personal matters, with Sammy Siegler providing percussion on the remaining tracks. Durst promised fans before its release that it would be a return to the 'rawer, more abrasive style' of their first album.

The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) was released as a 7-track EP internationally on May 3, 2005 with little fanfare or advertising, debuting at number 24 on the Billboard 200 and selling only 37,000 copies in its first week. It has sold just slightly over 100,000 in the US. It received mediocre reviews, with some critics thinking that Durst was trying too hard to imitate Rage Against the Machine's lead singer Zack de la Rocha.

Limp Bizkit's first greatest hits compilation was released on November 8, 2005. It contains material from the band's first four albums. An additional DVD was released in conjunction with the compilation. The album and DVD were barely promoted by the band's label, even to the point where Durst claimed he was being forced to do interviews about a compilation he wasn't very excited about. The promotion did not pay off, with the album debuting at number 47. Wes Borland stated that the release was ""a piece of shit and a waste of money.""

After the release of Greatest Hitz and the departure of Wes Borland the band unofficially went into a hiatus. Durst began directing and acting in films such as Population 436 and The Longshots. Otto went into rehab and collaborated with other bands and artists, as did the rest of the band (Rivers, DJ Lethal).

Rock im Park 2001 was released on March 31, 2008. The live album and DVD documented their 2001 performance at Rock im Park in 2001. It documents the band at the height of their popularity.


Reunion and Unicorns N' Rainbows Tour (2008–2009)

In mid-2008 rumors began to indicate that Limp Bizkit were planning a comeback tour, these rumors were later confirmed. Interviews with various members of the band had hinted that Terry Balsamo was to replace Wes Borland, but Balsamo was demanding a written contract, which the band was either unable or unwilling to give. Despite no official confirmation from the band, members of Limp Bizkit signed up on Twitter including Wes, with DJ Lethal confirming the accounts to be real, making Borland's rejoining seem less like a rumor. In late 2008, bassist Sam Rivers hinted that the group was in the early stages of writing new material for the fifth full-length album, the bands first full-length album in 6 years.

On February 11, 2009, Durst posted on his Twitter account the message ""1am pacific time- limpbizkit.com tonight"". The site was up and running for the first time in years and confirmed the return of Wes. Through a blog post on the homepage, Fred Durst and Wes Borland issued a joint statement:

“We decided we were more disgusted and bored with the state of heavy popular music than we were with each other. Regardless of where our separate paths have taken us, we recognize there is a powerful and unique energy with this particular group of people we have not found anywhere else. This is why Limp Bizkit is back.”

On May 20, 2009 the original lineup of Limp Bizkit performed together for the first time in eight years, at their first show ever in Latvia. The band went on to play a European tour named Unicorns N' Rainbows Tour. They also played German festivals Rock Im Park and Rock Am Ring on June 5 and 7 respectively, headlining the latter. Five days later the band landed in the UK and played at Download Festival. On August 1, the band took stage for a sold-out show in London's HMV Forum as part of Kerrang's Week of Rock. Limp Bizkit was officially inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame at the Kerrang! Awards, and the next day the band performed at the Sonisphere Festival, playing in between Machine Head and Nine Inch Nails. Less than two weeks later, Limp would again be playing alongside Nine Inch Nails, but also Keane in ETPFest, Korea, on August 15.

August 24, 2009 marked the official first day of recording new material, as well as the first time the entire band had recorded together since 2000 (Results May Vary without Wes Borland, The Unquestionable Truth Part 1 without John Otto).


Gold Cobra and recent events (2010–present)

On November 30, 2009 Durst revealed in a Kerrang! article that the new album would be titled Gold Cobra and would be released early 2010 (though later delayed) through Interscope. Durst told Kerrang Magazine in December 2009 that the album will feature 10 songs with interludes/segues between the songs. In a series of radio interviews Fred revealed that Wes Borland came up with the album name ""Gold Cobra"". Regarding the albums first single, Durst stated ""We are getting a little grief from the big wigs as to what single ""they"" want out first. Obviously ""we"" are pushing for ""Douchebag"". If they choose to run with something else we will figure out a way to release it anyway."" On March 29 Durst stated that eighteen songs are recorded and are currently in the process of being mixed, but noted that not all songs will make the album. Guest performances on the album include Mathematics, Raekwon (Wu-Tang Clan), Gene Simmons, and Paul Wall.

After the recording of Gold Cobra, Limp Bizkit performed a number of U.S. concerts including 98 Rock Fest, Rock on the Range, Beale Street Music Festival, EdgeFest 20, and Buzzfest. On May 10 the band performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Following the festival shows, the band was scheduled to embark on a full U.S. tour in July, but was postponed to fall 2010 due to the bands desire to play arenas instead of amphitheaters. Starting in August and into the fall the band performed a full European tour. The band was also scheduled for a South American tour, but was canceled due to a neck injury sustained by Fred Durst while performing in Warsaw, Poland.

On April 30, 2010, Durst posted the song ""Why Try"" via the band's official website. Due to delays, Durst decided to post a second song on August 7, 2010 for fans waiting for Gold Cobra, titled ""Walking Away"" through a blog on their official site.

On february 9th, Fred Durst posted on twitter: Limp Bizkit Gold Cobra should be mixed and ready to press by the end of February.

The day after,on the band's website,Durst wrote:

""As we head towards the end of February 2011 the realities of having a completed album to expose are finally here. Through thick and thin, the Gold Cobra has slivered its way through the corporate jungle and into the studio to be mixed by Dave Schiffman. My intentions are to keep as much ""polish"" off of this album as possible. I have had many discussions with Dave as he's been on the cobra since the beginning and knows exactly the sound I am looking for regarding the mix. We are extremely excited to get this album into your eardrums. As some of you have noticed, we have and will take as much time as we need before putting this album out regardless of any pressure or impatience that is thrown our way. So, waste your breath if you like. Its your prerogative.-fd""

It was also announced on the 15th of February that Limp Bizkit will perform on the sunday at Sonisphere festival in Knebworth.

Sigur Rós,"Sigur Rós are an Icelandic post-rock band.  The name is derived from the name of lead vocalist Jónsi Birgisson's little sister, Sigurrós. They hail from the same creative and vibrant Icelandic music scene as múm and Amiina. They released their first ever foray into film-making with their tour documentary, Heima in late 2007. 

Jón Þór Birgisson (Jónsi), Georg Hólm, and Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson formed the group in Reykjavík, Iceland in August 1994. They soon won a record deal with a local record label, Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). In 1997, they released Von (Hope) and in 1998, released a remix collection named Von brigði. The name is Icelandic wordplay: Vonbrigði means ""disappointment,"" but Von brigði means ""hope alteration."" (In English, the album is sometimes known by the alternative name ""Recycle Bin."")

International acclaim came with 1999's Ágætis Byrjun (""An alright start""), for which the band were joined by Kjartan Sveinsson. The album's reputation slowly spread by word of mouth over the next two years. Soon, many critics worldwide hailed it as one of the best albums of its time and the band was playing with Radiohead and other big names. Drummer Ágúst left the band after the recording of Ágætis Byrjun and was replaced by Orri Páll Dýrason.

After the release of Ágætis Byrjun, the band became perhaps most well known for Birgisson's signature style of playing guitar with the bow from a cello, accentuated with reverb, creating a sweeping, fluid sound that is unique for an electric guitar. 

In early 2001, Sigur Rós set out to record some songs in their newly-completed álafoss swimming pool studio with their friend Steindór Andersen who is a fisherman and chairman of the Icelandic poetry society, Iðunn. Steindór is a chanter/singer of the traditional Icelandic epic poetry form, called ""rímur,"" for which the band named their next EP, Rímur. Only 1000 copies of the EP were printed and sold in the spring tour of 2001. 

In 2002, their highly anticipated follow-up album ( ) was released. Upon release all tracks on the album were untitled, though the band later published song names on their website. Famously, all of the lyrics on ( ) are sung in vonlenska (""Hopelandic""), nonsensical vocalisations which resemble the sound of the Icelandic language. It has also been said that the listener is supposed to interpret their own meanings of the lyrics, which can then be written in the blank pages in the album booklet.

In October of 2003, Sigur Rós joined Radiohead in composing music for Merce Cunningham's dance piece Split Sides; Sigur Rós’s three tracks were named ""Ba Ba,"" ""Ti Ki,"" and ""Di Do"" and released in March of 2004 on an EP titled Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do The three songs are separate tracks, but the band intended that all three be played at the same time to form one single song. The band's 1997 debut album Von also finally found a United States and United Kingdom release in October of 2004. Their latest full-length album, Takk... (Thanks...), was released on September 13, 2005, with a free legal download of their first single, ""Glósóli,"" made available on August 15. For North American fans, ""Sæglópur"" was made available for download on August 16.""Hoppípolla,"" the second official single from Takk..., was released on November 28 alongside a new studio remake of ""Hafsól,"" a song which was previously released on the band's 1997 debut, Von. 

Sæglópur EP was released on July 10th in most parts of the world and on August 8th in the United States. Its original release date was May 8th, but because of the sudden demand of ""Hoppípolla,"" especially in the UK due to its inclusion on BBC's ""Planet Earth,"" it was pushed back from that date. Sigur Rós recorded three new songs for the EP: ""Refur,"" ""Ófriður,"" and ""Kafari.""

The Hvarf/Heim double album was released on November 5, 2007. Hvarf contains reworkings of songs dating back to the bands' first album, whereas Heim contains live acoustic versions of more well known songs. The double album was an accompaniment to the film Heima. Heima is a documentary showing footage of the band's tour of Iceland, including live footage and interviews. The official web site is www.heimafilm.com.

Sigur Rós has sold over 2.5 million albums worldwide.

On June 23, 2008, they released Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust. 
The single ""Gobbledigook"" was available for a free download on their website.

In January 2010, the band began a hiatus, and they are now working on new material. On August 11, 2011, the band's website showed a trailer for a project called Inni. A week later, the project was revealed to be a new live album and DVD, although the release date is currently unknown.

Sigur Rós'' sixth studio album,  Valtari, was released on May 29, 2012 on Parlophone.

In January 2013, Kjartan Sveinsson left the band and was not replaced. Sigur Rós's first album following his departure was titled Kveikur and released in June 2013.

In 2014, the band made a guest appearance in the HBO show 'Game of Thrones', performing The Rains of Castamere in the 2nd episode of the 4th season.

Mark Ronson,"Mark Ronson  (born 4 September 1975) is a sought-after producer, who's worked with such diverse artists as Jay-Z, Lily Allen, Robbie Williams, Bruno Mars, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Duran Duran and comedian Jimmy Fallon. 

Born in London, he is the son of writer Ann Dexter-Jones and real estate tycoon Laurence Ronson. His mother later married Mick Jones, lead guitarist of multiplatinum selling rock band Foreigner. He has two sisters: fashion designer Charlotte Ronson and DJ Samantha Ronson. He spent his childhood in a wealthy suburb of London where he lived on the same street as Paul McCartney‘s family. When his parents divorced at age 8, he moved to New York, where he made friends with John Lennon's son, Sean Lennon.

Ronson played guitar and drums from an early age, but it wasn't until moving to New York City with his mother that Ronson discovered DJ culture. At age 16, already a fan of such popular hip-hop artists as Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, Ronson began listening to the various hip-hop mixtapes released every few months by DJs. Inspired, Ronson confiscated his father's record collection and began trying his hand at mixing. 

The young DJ with the diverse taste soon caught the ears and eyes of various socialites and New York celebrities, including fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger, who featured Ronson along with other sons and daughters of celebrities in a 1997 fashion campaign. A year later, hip-hop mogul Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs hired Ronson to DJ his fabled 29th birthday bash. These and other high-profile gigs boosted Ronson's ""hip quotient"" and helped promote his more serious-minded music career. Fusing his eclectic turntable skills with his knowledge of musical instruments and songwriting, Ronson eventually embarked on his first solo project. Featuring such diverse guest artists as dancehall rapper Sean Paul, hip-hop artist Mos Def, Jack White of the White Stripes, and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, Ronson's debut album, Here Comes the Fuzz, bowed for Elektra in 2003.

Ronson's second album, Version, adds to his eclectic style. In this sophomore album, Ronson fuses a range of musical genres from Daniel Merriweather to Ol' Dirty Bastard to Phantom Planet with an up tempo contemporary funk sound. All the songs on this album are covers of previous Billboard top-10 pop songs, with a jazzy twist.

Career

Attending Vassar College and then New York University (NYU), Ronson became a regular at downtown hip-hop spots and made his name as a DJ on the New York club scene in 1993. He was soon one of the most respected DJs and was being called on for celebrities' private parties. Ronson is known for his diverse, genre-spanning selection, influenced by both the hip-hop scene of New York and the more rock influence of the UK, amongst others.

He moved on, however, to producing music. After producing Nikka Costa's song ""Everybody Got Their Something,"" Ronson signed a record contract with Elektra Records. His first album Here Comes the Fuzz was released in 2003 and was a critically acclaimed success that featured artists of all genres, despite initially poor sales. The most well known song from the album, "" Ooh Wee"" samples "" Sunny"" by Boney M and features Nate Dogg, Ghostface Killah, and Trife Da God. He has since produced multiple songs on the albums of singers Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen, and Robbie Williams.

In March 2006, Ronson released a cover of Radiohead's "" Just"" as a single. In certain areas, such as the UK, it gained major radio play. It also saw release as part of Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads, a full Radiohead covers CD, in April, later appearing on Ronson's second album, Version, which was released in the UK on 16 April 2007. It includes other covers of a diverse selection of rock & pop songs including: Kaiser Chiefs' "" Oh My God"" (featuring guest vocals from Lily Allen), an instrumental version of Coldplay's "" God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"", Britney Spears' ""Toxic"", Ryan Adams' ""Amy"", Maxïmo Park's "" Apply Some Pressure"", The Zutons' ""Valerie"" and Kasabian's ""L.S.F."".

Ronson released a cover of The Smiths' track ""Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before"" under the title "" Stop Me"" on 2 April 2007, which reached #2 in the UK singles charts, the biggest hit for Ronson to date. Ronson re-mixed the Bob Dylan song "" Most Likely You'll Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)"" in promotion for the three disc Bob Dylan set simply titled ""DYLAN"" to be released in October 2007. Ronson has also produced Candie Payne's ""One More Chance (Ronson mix)"" in 2007.

Ronson's second album Version has been well received by critics. In May 2007 it was awarded the title Album of the Month by the British dance music magazine Mixmag. On June 23, the DJ made the cover of the Guardian newspaper's Guide magazine, alongside the singer Lily Allen. In 2008, Ronson won a Grammy as producer of the year.

Deftones,"Deftones is an American Rock/Alternative Metal band from Sacramento, California, formed in 1988, consisting of Chino Moreno (lead vocals and guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Sergio Vega (bass), Frank Delgado (keyboards and turntables), and Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion). Vega (formerly of Quicksand) took on bass duties in mid-2009 in substitution for Chi Cheng, who was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Santa Clara, California on November 4, 2008. Cheng remained in a coma until his death on April 13, 2013 due to cardiac arrest.

While they were mostly an alternative metal band in their early years, their sound changed into something more complex and experimental in 2000, as a result they are often coined today as an alternative rock band. 

Critics have often praised them as one of the closest to unique rock bands of recent years for their innovative, atmospheric music; as Johnny Loftus writes, ""Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement [...] Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like dream pop and DC hardcore into their Northern California alt-metal.""

Frontman Chino Moreno’s poetic lyrics—described by a Time magazine critic as “fiercely intelligent”—are often evocative, yet are sparse enough to allow for multiple interpretations. Moreno has cited Morrissey, Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo, The Cure’s Robert Smith, and Depeche Mode’s David Gahan among his favorite singers, and beyond an occasional similarity in vocal technique, these singers’ sweeping sense of drama and delicate vulnerability is often evident in Moreno’s vocals.

Deftones members have worked on several side projects, including Moreno’s Team Sleep and drummer Abe Cunningam’s Phallucy. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter works with a group called Kush, featuring members of Fear Factory and Cypress Hill. Turntablist Frank Delgado has a DJ crew with DJ Crook of Team Sleep, DJ Julez and Matt D called Decibel Devils.

* Chino Moreno (vocals, guitar)
* Stephen Carpenter (guitar)
* Abe Cunningham (drums)
* Chi Cheng (bass, backing vocals)
* Frank Delgado (turntablist/keyboardist/sampler)

(Incidentally, Carpenter is generally credited with “strings”, though if he actually plays anything other than electric guitar it’s not immediately apparent. This most likely refers to his abuse of the guitar strings, making screeching noises inbetween playing riffs.)

Early years: 1989-1993
When Carpenter was 15 years old he was hit by a car while skateboarding. This left him confined to a wheelchair for several months. It was at this point that he began teaching himself guitar by playing along with bands such as Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death and Metallica. It has been reported that the driver paid Carpenter a cash settlement that allowed the band to purchase equipment, but drummer Abe Cunningham commented in an interview that this was ""a myth about how our band was started.""

Carpenter, Moreno and Cunningham went to the same high school. They were childhood friends and remained friends through the skateboarding scene in Sacramento. When Moreno found out Carpenter played guitar, he set up a jam session with Cunningham and the three began playing regularly in Carpenter's garage circa 1988. After playing with several bassists, the band settled on Justin Jaramillo and recorded a four track demo soon after. Within two years the band began playing club shows and later expanded their playing territory to San Francisco and Los Angeles where they played shows alongside bands such as Korn. While closing for another band in L.A., after the majority of the audience had left, the band impressed a Maverick Records representative. They were soon after signed to the label after showcasing three of their songs for Freddy DeMann and Guy Oseary.

The name ""Deftones"" was created by Carpenter who wanted to pick ""something that would just stand out but you know, not be all cheese-ball at the same time."" Carpenter combined the hip hop slang term ""def"", which was used by artists he listened to such as LL Cool J and Public Enemy, with the suffix ""-tones"", which was a popular suffix among 50s bands whose music he also enjoyed (e.g. Dick Dale and the Deltones; The Quin-Tones, The Monotones, The Cleftones and The Harptones). Carpenter said the name is intentionally vague to reflect the band's tendency to not focus on just one style of music.


Adrenaline: 1994-1996
The band's debut album, Adrenaline, was recorded at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington and released on October 3, 1995. It was produced by Deftones and Terry Date, who would go on to produce the band's next three albums. Initially unsuccessful, extensive touring, word-of-mouth and Internet promotion built the band a dedicated fanbase, as well as helping Adrenaline to sell over 220,000 copies without the singles ""7 Words"" and ""Bored"" (as well as their music videos) receiving any airplay. The band contributed the non-album track ""Teething"" to the soundtrack for the 1996 film The Crow: City of Angels and are also seen performing the song live during one of the film's scenes.

The album spent 21 weeks on the Billboard Heatseekers chart reaching a peak position of 23. When asked what he attributed the album's success to, Cheng responded, ""One word: perseverance. We've been together for almost eight years, on the road for two and we do it with honesty and integrity - and the kids can tell."" The album was RIAA certified gold on 7 July 1999 in recognition of 500,000 units sold.

Regarding the recording of the album, Abe Cunningham said, ""At the time we did the first record - which I really like and think is good - you can tell the band was really young. We'd been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn't really think a whole lot about making the songs better."" Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded ""really fast""[ and performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure 58 microphone. A review of Adrenaline praised the album's musical control, precision, overall groove and Cunningham's ""surprisingly sophisticated drumming"". It was also noted that ""there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno's whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit.""
Adrenaline was certified platinum on September 23, 2008 by the RIAA


Around the Fur: 1997-1999
Deftones' second album, Around the Fur, was recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle, Washington and produced by Terry Date. Released on October 26, 1997, the album included a collaboration with singer Max Cavalera (of Sepultura/Soulfly/Cavalera Conspiracy) on ""Headup"", a tribute to Cavalera's late stepson Dana Wells, to whom the album was also dedicated. Although not yet a member of the band, Delgado is credited as ""audio"" on five of the album's tracks and Cunningham's wife, Annalynn, provides guest vocals on ""MX"".

""When we went in to make this record, we really didn't have a set idea of what we wanted to come out with,"" said Moreno in a 1998 interview with Chart magazine. However, he felt that the album ""fell into place"" once the band had settled into the studio. The band expanded its sound, spending more time with Terry Date, and giving more thought to the album's production. Cunningham varied his drum sound and experimented by using different types of snare drum on almost every track. The album was praised for its loud-soft dynamics, the flow of the tracks, Moreno's unusual vocals and the strong rhythm-section grooves created by Cheng and Cunningham. Stephen Thomas Erlewine's review noted that ""while they don't have catchy riffs or a fully developed sound, Around the Fur suggests they're about to come into their own.""

The album was highly anticipated and propelled the band to fame in the alternative metal scene on the strength of radio and MTV airplay for the singles ""My Own Summer (Shove It)"" and ""Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)"". Around the Fur sold 43,000 copies in its first week of release, and entered the Billboard 200 at number 29 (its peak position), remaining on the charts for 17 weeks. The band went back to touring, making appearances at the Warped Tour (in the United States, New Zealand and Australia), Pinkpop Festival, Roskilde Festival and Ozzfest as well as releasing a live EP on June 22, 1999. Around the Fur went on to reach RIAA gold status on June 24, 1999.


White Pony: 2000-2002
On June 20, 2000, the band released their third album, White Pony, again produced by Terry Date and Deftones. It was recorded at The Plant Studios in Sausalito, California and at Larrabee Sound Studios, West Hollywood, California. The album debuted at number three in the US Billboard chart with sales of 178,000 copies. Delgado (DJ Speedboat) was now a full-time band member, adding new elements to the band's music. The melancholy ""Teenager"", for example, was a radical departure in style and mood, a ""love song,"" according to Moreno, which incorporated elements of glitch and trip hop, with programming duties carried out by Moreno's friend and side-project Team Sleep bandmate DJ Crook. A collaboration with singer Maynard James Keenan of Tool is present on ""Passenger"", and the refrain in ""Knife Party"" features vocals by Rodleen Getsic. Moreno had also started contributing additional guitar on several tracks.

An interview with the band in Alternative Press explained the recording process of White Pony. After a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording White Pony, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno explained that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of ""Change (In the House of Flies)"" was the turning point where the band began working as a group. Despite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time making the album. Cheng explained that ""We didn’t feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make."" Moreno did not have a common theme in mind lyrically, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics, explaining that ""I basically didn’t sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things.""

Reviews were generally positive, noting Moreno's increasing sophistication as a lyricist and the group's experimentalism. Of White Pony, one reviewer wrote that ""Deftones went soft, but in an impressive way, to twist around its signature punk sound.""

The album was originally released as an 11 track version beginning with ""Feiticeira"" and ending with ""Pink Maggit"" and featuring gray cover art. A limited edition print of 50,000 black and red jewel case versions of White Pony were also released at the same time with a bonus 12th track entitled ""The Boy's Republic"". Later, the band released ""Back to School (Mini Maggit)"", a rap-influenced interpretation of the album's closer, ""Pink Maggit"". ""Back to School (Mini Maggit)"" was track 11 on the leaked pre-release version of White Pony in April 2000, but not included on the original (official) issue of the album in June 2000. The leaked version of White Pony also included the slower version of ""Pink Maggit"" which appeared on the first official White Pony CDs. That song was listed as a bonus track (track 12) on the leaked pre-release version.  The song was picked up as a single and placed as the new opening track (with ""Pink Maggit"" still the closer) of a re-released White Pony on October 3, 2000 featuring altered white cover art. Not entirely happy with re-releasing the album, the band negotiated to have ""Back to School"" made available as a free download for anyone who had already bought the original album. Chino noted that ""Everybody's already downloaded our record before it came out anyway, otherwise I'd be kind of feelin' like, 'Man, why [are] we putting [out] all these different versions of the record?' [...] that's the best way we can actually get this song out to the people who already purchased this record, for free basically. And if they wanna buy the record again, it's cool.""

White Pony achieved platinum status, selling over 1.3 million copies in the US, and earning the band a 2001 Grammy award for Best Metal Performance for the song ""Elite"".


Deftones: 2003-2005
Deftones began work on their fourth album under the working title Lovers. Regarding the album's direction, Cheng commented that ""We've proven that we can musically go in any direction we want, and we want to get kind of heavy on this one."" Moreno underwent vocal training as a precaution after severely damaging his vocal cords on the band's 2001 summer tour. The band converted their rehearsal space in Sacramento into a fully equipped studio and recorded most of the album there at negligible cost. The band brought in Terry Date to assist with production, and also received input on musical arrangement from Greg Wells on several of the album's tracks. The band later added more material at Studio X in Seattle, WA and at Larrabee Studios in West Hollywood, CA. Overall the album took twelve months and cost roughly $2.5 million to produce with the band being fined by Maverick for missing deadlines.

In January 2003, Deftones left the studio to perform some ""one off"" shows in Australia and New Zealand as part of the annual Big Day Out Festival. Shortly after, the band returned to the studio to finish their fourth album. The self-titled Deftones was released on May 20, 2003. Deftones entered the Billboard 200 at number two and sold 167,000 copies in its first week. The album remained in the Billboard top 100 for nine weeks, supported by the first single, ""Minerva"". The band shot a video for their second single, ""Hexagram"", with fans watching the band play the song in an indoor skatepark in Simi Valley, California. The band made a video for the track ""Bloody Cape"", but it was never released for play on television. The video was only made available on the band's official website for one day. It was later released on their B-Sides and Rarities DVD.

Reviews were mainly positive, praising the band for the heavy album's progression and originality in the midst of declining creativity in contemporary metal. Moreno was quoted as saying, ""It's all on record. We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't going to be with them."" In reviewing Deftones, Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that ""Hexagram"", the album's opener, ""hits hard — harder than they ever have, revealing how mushy Staind is, or how toothless Linkin Park is,"" but also goes on to say that the album ""sticks a little too close to familiar territory."" The Onion's A.V. Club similarly called the album ""less rewarding than its predecessor, though its peaks rival any in the genre.""

The band released a compilation album titled B-Sides & Rarities on October 4, 2005. The CD includes various b-sides and covers from throughout their career, while the DVD contains behind-the-scenes footage and the band's complete videography up to that point.


Saturday Night Wrist: 2006-2007
 Deftones performing live in Glasgow, June 2006.The band's latest album, titled Saturday Night Wrist, was released on October 31, 2006. It debuted at number ten in the US Billboard chart with sales of just over 76,000, a significant decrease on the first week sales of their two previous releases.

Rather than work with longtime producer Terry Date, Deftones decided to record with Bob Ezrin. Cunningham says that while the group enjoyed working with Date, ""At this point, we just needed to change things up [...] And this is definitely a different style. Working with him [Ezrin] is just putting us fucking upside down. He's cracking the whip.""[45] After recording all the instrumentals for the record, Chino Moreno decided to record his vocals separately. Chino thus finished recording the album with former Far guitarist Shaun Lopez as producer. Collaborations on the record include Annie Hardy from Giant Drag on the song ""Pink Cellphone"" and Serj Tankian from System of a Down on the track ""Mein"".

The album's first single was called ""Hole in the Earth"", hitting the radio on October 16, 2006. ""Hole in the Earth"" was also featured as a downloadable song for the PS3 & Xbox 360 versions of Guitar Hero 3. ""Mein"" was the album's second single, which aired in Spring of 2007.

As of March 2007, Saturday Night Wrist has sold over 250,000 copies (US).

Deftones spent the majority of 2006 and 2007 touring around the world in support of the album. The band played shows in places including North America, Canada, Europe, South America, Japan and Australia. The band also performed in such tours as Taste of Chaos, Family Values Tour and the Soundwave Festival in Australia.


Eros: 2008-2009
Deftones are currently in the studio writing and recording their next release, Eros, which will once again utilize the production services of Terry Date. Deftones have been writing the album since Fall 2007. As of December 7, 2007, six to eight songs were finished and the album is expected to be released in the winter of 2008. Chino Moreno has described the album as weird, unorthodox, featuring a lot of atmosphere and soundscaping, and having ""fuck you, I hope you die!"" style aggression. He has also stated that he won't be contributing on guitar, instead focusing on his vocals, and will leave guitar duties entirely to Stephen Carpenter. Carpenter will be utilizing his signature 8-String guitar, the ESP Stef B-8. They started recording the album on April 14th, 2008.

Moreno stated that this album would be more up-tempo (as far as the drumming is concerned), going on to say that the past couple of albums have been more mid-tempo; that Abe Cunningham has been playing faster. He also referred to the album as being ""snappy"". Moreno stated in an interview that the process for this album would be more raw and simplified after dissatisfaction with the long and ""pieced-together"" experience of recording Saturday Night Wrist.

On January 14th, Chino Moreno posted an instrumental electronic beat that sounds similar to Team Sleep called ""You've Seen The Butcher"", on the Deftones' MySpace page, and announced in a bulletin that the album would be called Eros, the Greek word for ""love."" It was also announced that Eros would be released by Reprise Records, the first time Deftones have released an album not affiliated with Maverick Records.

On September 18, Deftones played a secret show at the Spaceland Club in Los Angeles. The band played a new song entitled Melanie, which they also played at the previously announced headlining show at the Ventura Theater in Ventura, California on September 19 and also at the KUPD's End of Summer Scorcher on September 20 in Peoria, Arizona, where they co-headlined with Alice In Chains.

Also, recently Deftones have been posting a number of videos on MySpace and their blog, documenting the recording process of Eros.

On November 4, bassist Chi Cheng was seriously injured in a car accident in Santa Clara, California. Chino Moreno posted on the band's blog, saying, ""It deeply saddens me to inform you all that our brother Chi Cheng was involved in a terrible car accident last night. He is currently in a Northern California hospital in serious, but stable condition. I am on my way up north right now to be by his side, along with the rest of our bandmates and family. Chi is one of the strongest people I know, and I'm praying that his strength will get him through this. Please say a prayer for him as well.""[47] Following the accident, Cheng's bandmates and mother, Jeanne, began using the Deftones blog to post updates on Cheng's condition. In a post dated November 18, it was stated that ""Chi's condition remains the same - serious, but stable. He still lies in a coma, however his vitals (heart, lungs, and blood pressure) all exhibit very stable functions and doctors have begun removing much of the excess monitoring equipment."" In a blog posted dated November 9, it was reported that Chi was attended by three off-duty EMTs who happened upon the accident scene. The post goes on to state that ""If not for them, the chances of Chi making to the hospital alive would have been poor."" On December 9, it was announced that Chi had been moved into the care of an unnamed hospital that ""specializes in the care and management of traumatic and non-trauma related brain injuries"".

Diamond Eyes: 2010-2011
It was announced that the new album would be titled ""Diamond Eyes"", to be released May 18th, 2010.

 Koi No Yokan: 2012
On March 29, 2012 an interview with Stephen Carpenter was posted on ESP Guitars's YouTube channel. In it, Carpenter talks about his switch to 7-string and 8-string guitars. At the end, he says, ""Musically, me and my band, Deftones, are working on a new record and we hope to have it finished and out by Summer of 2012, and when the new record's done we'll start another touring cycle and get out there and play our stuff for those who are interested.""
Chino Moreno has also stated that it has resemblance to their 2000 record, White Pony, when it's compared to their previous work. “The songs are very different from each other, not heavier or slower, but more dynamic, going towards several directions, it’s heavy, but beautiful.” In addition, it has been reported that Nick Raskulinecz will return to produce their seventh effort, which is, as of yet, unnamed.
On April 3, 2012 after performing at the Quilmes Rock 2012 festival, Chino was interviewed about Crosses and the new Deftones record. He said that the writing process was completed last week and they start recording after he gets back from South America. ""We start recording next week. I love it, I'm so excited about it because Deftones, obviously, that's my life, I've made a career since I was fifteen years old and right before I came last week we finished all the writing so, next week, when I get back, we start recording. We should have a record that comes out in the early Fall, maybe October. Maybe September."" 

The album was released through Reprise Records on November 12, 2012, in the UK and November 13, 2012, in the United States. Band frontman Chino Moreno characterized the album as ""dynamic"" with a full range of sound, noting that more contributions were made to the album from bassist Sergio Vega compared to their previous record, Diamond Eyes.

deadmau5,"Born (January 5, 1981) and raised in Niagara Falls, Canada, Joel Zimmerman (aka ""deadmau5"") has become one of the most sought-after artists on the electronic music scene in recent times. He is known for his highly entertaining live gigs, often performing wearing a large cartoon mouse head.

He first started his career as co-producer of the Niagara Falls radio show “The Party Revolution” (101.1 The Planet). After gaining exposure to all the many facets of electronic music, Joel then moved on to collaborate with many other artists and record labels around the world.

In 2005, deadmau5 released his first album, ""Get Scraped, which had many genres and was very different from his new sound."" After that, he released Vexillology, in 2006. His first mainstream album, and his third album, was Random Album Title in 2008, which went towards a progressive house sound and featured many hit songs like Arguru, Not Exactly and I Remember, with Kaskade. His next album was For Lack of a Better Name, which had more of a tech house style. After that was 4x4=12, which contains his two released dubstep songs. His album > album title goes here < shows a few similarities to Get Scraped. His latest album is ""while(1<2),"" released in 2014.

He has worked with a number of artists both underground and mainstream - including Melleny Melody, Orgy, Kaskade, MC Flipside, Rob Swire of Pendulum, Skrillex, Tiësto and Steve Duda.

Black Eyed Peas,"Black Eyed Peas are an American hip hop/pop group formed in Los Angeles in 1995. The group currently line-up is formed by will.i.am, Taboo, Fergie and apl.de.ap. Black Eyed Peas have so-far sold an estimated 56 million albums and singles worldwide.

Black Eyed Peas went to centenary state high school and got their start in 1988 when will.i.am (born 1975 William James Adams Jr.) and apl.de.ap (born 1974 Allan Pineda) began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) after catching the attention of the nephew of Jerry Heller (Eazy-E's manager). Along with Mookie Mook (Burning Star), Dante Santiago & DJ Motiv8, they called their group A.T.B.A.N. Klann. Their debut album, 'Grass Roots', was not released originally because Ruthless did not consider the social themes reflected in the group's music to be marketable to their audience. A single ""Puddles of H2O"" was released in 1994 but no album was released (until it leaked onto the Internet in the mid 2000s). 

After Eazy-E died of an AIDS related illness in 1995, they changed their name to Black Eyed Peas; will.i.am explained on the front cover of the Monkey Business album that ""Black Eyed Peas are food for the soul"", hence the name. will.i.am has cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence and said he named his band after a food, like them. They replaced their original third member Mookie, with Dante Santiago the Peas original singer. Then Taboo (born Jaime Gomez) joined the group. Dante Santiago took on a role as a guest vocalist in the band and featured frequently on various tracks for their first four albums. 

In 1996, they produced and appeared on a song entitled ""That's Right"" for Brian Austin Green's hip-hop album One Stop Carnival. Later, they began using Kim Hill as a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the ""gangsta rap"" sounds of other Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. Through the mid-'90s, they performed in the local club circuit alongside fellow acts such as Ozomatli and Jurassic 5.

The group were signed to Interscope Records and released their debut, ""Behind the Front"", in 1998. The album won the group (and their accompanying live band, the Bucky Jonsons) critical acclaim. The album featured the single ""Joints & Jams"", which was included on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album, ""Bridging the Gap"", was released in 2000; it featured the single ""Request + Line"" featuring Macy Gray.

After replacing their female background singer with Fergie, the group released their breakout album, ""Elephunk"", and their 2005 album, ""Monkey Business"", which featured the hit singles ""Pump It"", ""Don't Phunk With My Heart"", ""Don't Lie"" and ""My Humps"".

""The E.N.D. (The Energy Never Dies)"", their fifth album, was released worldwide in June 2009 and has managed to sell 5 million copies in 8 months (Elephunk: 7 million, Monkey Business: 10 million). It already spawned 2 of the most downloaded singles of all time: ""Boom Boom Pow"" and ""I Gotta Feeling"", both were downloaded 5 million times only in the USA. The 3rd single ""Meet Me Halfway"" was downloaded 2 million times and the 4th ""Imma Be"", which was just released, already sold 1 million. ""Rock That Body"" is the 5th single.

The Kinks,"The Kinks (1963–1996) were an English pop-rock group that came out of the British R&B scene of the early 1960s. Formed in Muswell Hill, North London, by brothers Ray Davies and Dave Davies in 1964 and categorised in the United States as a ""British Invasion"" band, the Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era. In 1990, their first year of eligibility, the original four members were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Later, in November 2005, they were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. Among numerous other honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for ""Outstanding Service to British Music"" in 2006. 

Formed in 1963 in Muswell Hill, North London, they first gained prominence on the heels of the well-received and highly influential single ""You Really Got Me"" (1964). The group originally consisted of lead singer/guitarist Ray Davies, his brother lead guitarist Dave Davies, drummer Mick Avory, and bassist Peter Quaife.  Quaife left (twice) in the late 1960s, and Avory finally left in 1984 as the result of a long-running dispute with Dave Davies, leaving only the Davies brothers as the core of the original group.

With Ray Davies' songwriting skills and unashamedly English voices, Dave Davies' impressive guitar work, and Avory's tight and steady drumming, the band became one of the best and most influential groups of British pop and the ""British Invasion"" of the U.S.A., lasting longer than any of their competitors, apart from the Rolling Stones, as they broke up in 1996. Their catalogue of songs has been covered by Van Halen, The Pretenders, The Black Keys, The Stranglers, Queens of the Stone Age , and many more.

Billy Joel,"Billy Joel (born William Martin Joel on May 9, 1949 in Bronx, New York, USA) is an American pianist, singer-songwriter, and composer. Since releasing his first hit song, ""Piano Man,"" in 1973, Joel has become a multi-million-selling recording artist. Joel recorded many popular hit songs and albums from 1971 until he stopped recording pop/rock music in 1993. He is one of the very few rock (or even pop) artists to have Top 10 hits in the '70s, '80s, and '90s. A six-time Grammy Award winner, he has sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide and is the sixth best selling artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. 

Joel's induction into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (Class of 1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Class of 1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (Class of 2006) has further solidified his status as one of America's leading music icons. He has continued to tour occasionally (sometimes with Elton John) in addition to writing and recording classical music.

Joel first lived in the South Bronx, in New York City, but his family soon moved to Hicksville, Long Island. Often he himself, along with many in the media, have confused this with him living in neighboring Levittown, NY (formed 1947). In truth, Joel lived on Meeting Lane in Hicksville, a town that has existed since 1648, near the Levittown border, in a section of town where Post-WW2, there were houses developed by Abe Levitt, known as Levitt Houses, thus forming nearby Levittown. His father, Howard Joel, was a Jewish Holocaust survivor from Germany, whose father Karl Amson Joel owned the fourth largest mail order company in Germany before being dispossessed by the Nazis. His mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England, to an agnostic Jewish family. His parents later divorced, and his father moved back to Eastern Europe. His half-brother Alexander Joel is an acclaimed classical pianist and conductor in Europe, now living in New York. 

From an early age Joel had an intense interest in music; especially classical music. He began piano lessons at an early age, and his interest in music instead of sports was the source for much teasing and bullying in his early years. As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, but abandoned the sport shortly after having his nose broken in a boxing match.

Joel attended Hicksville High School, and was to have graduated in 1967. However, he was one English credit short of the graduation requirement; he overslept on the day of an important exam due to his late-night musician's lifestyle.[citation needed] Faced with a summer in school to complete this requirement, he decided not to continue. He left high school without a diploma to begin a career in music. In 1992, the English credit requirement was waived by the Hicksville School Board and he received his diploma at Hicksville High's graduation ceremony 25 years after he left the school.

At the age of 14 Joel joined his first band, The Echoes (which later became The Lost Souls). According to producer Shadow Morton, Joel was also the pianist on the Shangri-Las hit ""Remember (Walking In The Sand)"". In 1966, he joined The Hassles, a Long Island band that had some local success (""Every Step I Take,"" ""You Got Me Hummin'""). The Hassles released two albums The Hassles (1967) and Hour of the Wolf (1968) on the United Artists record label. Following The Hassles' demise in 1969, he formed the pop rock duo Attila with Hassles drummer Jon Small. Attila released their eponymous debut album in July 1970 and disbanded the following October.

Upon losing his record contract with Attila, Joel suffered severe depression, and was admitted into Meadowbrook Hospital after ingesting furniture polish in a half-hearted suicide attempt. The note he left eventually became the lyrics to his song ""Tomorrow Is Today."" Upon release from Meadowbrook Hospital in early 1971, he began to re-explore his place in the music business, including the participation in a television commercial with Chubby Checker and the contribution of rock criticism to a music magazine called Changes.

*Cold Spring Harbor (1971)
Joel signed his first solo record contract with Artie Ripp of Family Productions, and subsequently recorded his first solo album. Cold Spring Harbor (a reference to the Long Island town of the same name), was released in 1971. However, the album was mastered at the wrong speed, and the album was initially released with this error, resulting in Joel sounding a half step too high (Joel later commented that he sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks). The onerous terms of the Family Productions contract also guaranteed him very little money from the sales of his albums.

In order to get out of the deal with Family Productions, Joel moved to Los Angeles, California with Elizabeth Weber, and they married in Los Angeles in May, 1971. For six months of the following year, he played in the Executive Lounge piano bar under the name Bill Martin. This experience is what gave him the material for ""Piano Man.""

In addition, a Philadelphia radio station, WMMR-FM, started playing a tape of a new song, ""Captain Jack,"" which was taken from a live concert broadcast which became an underground hit on the East Coast. An Executive from Columbia Records named Herb Gordon, heard his music and made his record label aware of Joel's talent. From there he signed with Columbia Records. Hits such as ""She's Got a Way"" and ""Everybody Loves You Now"" were originally released on this album, though they did not gain much attention until released as live performances in 1981 on Songs in the Attic. Since then they have become regular concert numbers. Cold Spring Harbor got a second chance on the charts in 1983, when Columbia reissued the album after slowing it down to the correct speed. The album reached # 158 in the US and # 95 in the UK nearly a year later.

*Piano Man (1973)
His experiences in Los Angeles connected him with record company executives, who bought out his contract with Ripp, with the condition that the ""Family Productions"" logo be displayed alongside the Columbia logo for the next five albums. Also in the contract was the agreement that Family Productions would receive a 25 cent royalty for every album Joel sold, which would come back to haunt him when he hit it big. His brief tenure in Los Angeles also inspired his signature song ""Piano Man."" The album Piano Man was released in late 1973 and was certified Gold. To this day it has sold over four million copies. However, due to the large sums of money involved in the legal tangles of the contract buyout, Joel netted less than $7,000 in profit from his certified Gold record. Although this album is best known for its title track, several other future gems include ""Captain Jack,"" ""The Ballad of Billy the Kid,"" and ""You're My Home"" (the b-side of the ""Piano Man"" single, which would later be covered by Helen Reddy), all of which would become staples of Joel's live shows.

*Streetlife Serenade (1974)
Joel remained in Los Angeles to write Streetlife Serenade, his second album under the Columbia label. References to both suburbia and the inner city pepper the album. The standout track on the album is ""The Entertainer,"" which picks up thematically where ""Piano Man"" left off. Joel was upset that ""Piano Man"" had been significantly edited down in order to make it more radio-friendly, and in ""The Entertainer,"" he refers to the edit with sarcastic lines such as, ""If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05."" This refers to the album version of this song which is 5:37, and the edited single which is 3:05. Although Streetlife Serenade is considered one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel has confirmed his distaste for the album), it still contains some notable tracks including the title track, with its Debussy-like intro, ""Los Angelenos,"" and the instrumental ""The Mexican Connection.""

*Turnstiles (1976)
Disenchanted with the LA music scene, Joel returned to New York in 1975. There he recorded what many fans and critics consider one of his best albums, Turnstiles. On Turnstiles, Joel used his own hand-picked musicians in the studio for the first time, and took a more hands-on role. Songs were initially recorded and produced by famed Chicago producer James William Guercio, who subsequently was fired. The songs were re-recorded and Joel took over, producing the album himself. Joel's ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"" was a minor hit, echoed the Phil Spector sound, and was even covered by Ronnie Spector. The album also featured the New York anthem, ""New York State of Mind,"" a bluesy, jazzy epic that has become one of Joel's signature songs and was later covered by fellow Columbia labelmate Barbra Streisand on her Streisand Superman album. Other top songs on the album include ""Summer, Highland Falls,"" and ""Miami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway)."" Songs such as ""Prelude/Angry Young Man"" would become a mainstay of his concerts for years.

*The Stranger (1977)
For his album The Stranger, Columbia Records united Joel with producer Phil Ramone. The album yielded four Top 40 hits on the Billboard Charts in the US. Album sales exceeded Columbia's previous top album, Simon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water, and was certified multi-platinum. It was Joel's first Top Ten album, as it rose to # 2 on the charts. Phil Ramone eventually produced every Billy Joel studio release until 1989's Storm Front. The Stranger netted Joel Grammy nominations, for Album of the Year and Song of the Year, for ""Just the Way You Are"", which was written as a gift to his wife Elizabeth and became his highest charting song to date in the United States.

In 2007 ""The Stranger"" was re-released with a bonus disk of a live concert recorded at Carnegie Hall June 3, 1977 that featured mostly songs from his first three albums. One can only guess that the success of ""The Stranger"" and ""52nd Street"" made this live album a bit obsolete for release at the time.

*52nd Street (1978)
Joel faced high expectations on his next album. 52nd Street was conceived as a day in Manhattan, and was named after the block where Columbia Records' office was located. Fans purchased over seven million copies on the strength of the hits ""My Life"", ""Big Shot,"" and ""Honesty."" This helped 52nd Street become Joel's first # 1 album. ""My Life"" eventually became the theme song for a new US television sitcom, Bosom Buddies, which featured actor Tom Hanks in one of his earliest roles. 52nd Street was the first album to be released on Compact Disc in Japan (1982). The album won Grammys for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male & Album of the Year. Despite all the cover art for the album showing Joel holding a trumpet, he doesn't play the instrument on the album. The trumpet is only played on one track, ""Zanzibar"", by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.

*Glass Houses (1980)
Joel in a promotional picture for Glass Houses.The success of his piano-driven ballads like ""Just the Way You Are"" and ""Honesty"" never sat well with him. With Glass Houses, Joel attacked the new wave popularity with aplomb. This album yielded such classics as ""You May Be Right"" (# 7, May 1980), ""Close To The Borderline""(flipside of the ""You May Be Right"" single), ""Don't Ask Me Why"" (# 19, September 1980), ""Sometimes A Fantasy"" (# 36, November 1980) and ""It's Still Rock & Roll to Me,"" which became Joel's first Billboard # 1 song in July, 1980. Glass Houses won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. It would also win the American Music Award for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category.

*Songs In The Attic (1981)
His next release, Songs In The Attic, was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. Songs In The Attic was recorded during arena and club shows in June and July of 1980. This release introduced many fans, who just discovered Joel when The Stranger became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions.

*The Nylon Curtain (1982)
The next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of The Nylon Curtain. Considered his most audacious and ambitious album, Joel took more than a page or two from the Lennon-McCartney songwriting style on this heavily Beatles-influenced album.
Work began on The Nylon Curtain in the spring of 1982. However, Joel was sidelined when he was involved in a serious motorcycle accident. The driver ran a red light and collided with Joel, who was on his motorcycle. His left wrist was broken and his hand badly damaged. Due to surgery, which included the temporary insertion of five pins into his wrist, and a month in the hospital, production of the album was shut down temporarily while Joel recovered. In the meantime, Joel's first video special, Live from Long Island, was recorded at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, on December 30, 1982. The Nylon Curtain went to # 7 on the charts, supported by the popular singles ""Allentown"", Goodnight Saigon, and Pressure. Allentown rose to # 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982 and the most successful song from The Nylon Curtain album. The album is considered by many of his fans to be the masterpiece of his works. Joel's marriage began to suffer as his success rose, and Joel and wife Elizabeth divorced. In accordance with the divorce agreement, Elizabeth took half of the singer's assets. Following his tour supporting The Nylon Curtain, Joel retreated to the island of St. Bart's for rest and relaxation. At the hotel's bar, he met supermodel Christie Brinkley, who had been divorced from her husband Jean-François Allaux. They eventually became a couple, and married on March 23, 1985.

*An Innocent Man (1983) 
Joel in a promotional picture for An Innocent Man.The song ""Uptown Girl"" was one of the first songs written when Joel returned from vacation. ""Uptown Girl"" was conceived as Joel wondered aloud how the gorgeous Christie Brinkley could wind up with a guy like him. It became a worldwide hit upon its release, and Joel's sole # 1 in the United Kingdom. The resulting album, An Innocent Man, was compiled as a tribute to the doo-wop music of the 1950s, and also resulted in Joel's second Billboard # 1 hit, ""Tell Her About It."" The album, which reached # 4 on the charts, boasted 6 top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. An Innocent Man was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but ultimately lost to Michael Jackson's Thriller.

*Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 (1985)
Following the success of An Innocent Man, Joel had been approached to release an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered ""Greatest Hits"" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time, he agreed, and Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 was released as a 4-sided album and 2-CD set, with the songs in sequence of when they were released. The new songs ""You're Only Human (Second Wind)"" and ""The Night Is Still Young"" were recorded and released as singles to support the album. Greatest Hits was highly successful, selling over 20 million copies worldwide and becoming the top-selling double album of all time by a solo artist (and second overall after The Wall by Pink Floyd). It has since been certified diamond by the RIAA for 10.5 million albums sold (21 million disks). To date it is the 6th best selling album in American music history according to the RIAA.

Coinciding with the Greatest Hits album release, Joel released a 2-volume Video Album that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the Greatest Hits album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, ""Piano Man,"" for this project. Two versions of Greatest Hits were released on CD: the initial release on double CD in 1985, and a re-released Enhanced CD version in 1998. While both are the same basic album in general, there are a number of subtle differences between the two:

While all the longer hits (""Piano Man,"" ""Captain Jack,"" ""Goodnight Saigon"") are fully intact, many other shorter songs (""Pressure,"" ""Just The Way You Are,"" ""My Life"") were shortened significantly in the 1985 release. Oddly enough, the included booklet lists all of the lyrics, even the parts cut for time. These songs are fully restored in the re-release. The 1985 release features the live version of ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"" from Songs in the Attic. The version from Turnstiles was used for the 1998 re-release. 
The 1998 re-release features enhanced content due to advancements in CD technology over the previous 13 years. 

*The Bridge (1986)
Joel had already scored a hit with ""Modern Woman"" from the 1985 movie, ""Ruthless People,"" (starring Bette Midler, Danny DeVito, Helen Slater and Judge Reinhold), when he began work on the album that would become The Bridge in early 1986. Ray Charles contributed vocals and music to the song ""Baby Grand"" with Joel, and Steve Winwood played Hammond organ on the song ""Getting Closer."" The final song recorded for the album was ""Code Of Silence."" Cyndi Lauper appears on the album, contributing backing vocals. Though it broke into the Top Ten, The Bridge was not a success in relation to some of Joel's other albums, but it yielded the hit ""A Matter Of Trust."" In a departure from his ""piano man"" persona, Joel is shown in its video as playing a Les Paul-autographed Gibson guitar. The ballad ""This Is The Time"" also charted, and has been a favorite on the prom circuit ever since. ""Modern Woman"" was also released as a single and was quite successful, but Joel has since said in interviews he doesn't care for the song, and subsequently it has been left off most of his compilation sets (the exception appears to be My Lives). It was also the last Billy Joel album to carry the ""Family Productions"" logo.

At around this time, Billy completed voice work on Disney's Oliver & Company, released in 1988. A loose adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist, Billy brought both his acting and musical talents to the film as Dodger. For the film, Billy recorded a song titled ""Why Should I Worry?"" Critics were generally positive towards the film, and pointed to Billy's acting contribution as one of its highlights, despite it being his first acting job. In interviews, Billy explained that he took the job due to his love of Disney cartoons as a child.

Throughout his tour supporting The Bridge, Joel and his handlers started planning a trip to the Soviet Union. He would be the first American rock act to play there since the Berlin Wall went up, a fact not lost on history buff Joel. There would be six live performances, three each at indoor arenas in Moscow and Leningrad. Joel and his family (including young daughter Alexa) and his full touring band made the trip in June 1987. The entourage was filmed for television and video to eventually offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world.

The audience in at least the first Moscow shows was filled with members of the Communist Party, who received tickets from the government as a perk. Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel's energetic show, something that never had happened in other countries he had performed in. As a result of that a minor international incident occurred when he famously flipped over an electric keyboard during the second Moscow show as a show of frustration that his lighting engineers would not turn down the house lights to calm the audience despite several requests. The lighting engineers were more concerned with the amount of light being adequate for filming. 

*КОНЦЕРТ (1987)
The album КОНЦЕРТ, Russian for ""Concert,"" was released in the fall of 1987. Singer Peter Hewlitt was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like ""An Innocent Man."" It has been estimated that Joel lost over US $1 million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.

* Storm Front (1989)
The song ""We Didn't Start the Fire,"" the first single from the album Storm Front, was released in September 1989. The song became Joel's third US Number 1 hit. Storm Front was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first Number 1 album since Glass Houses, 9 years earlier. Storm Front was Joel's first album since Turnstiles to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with Mick Jones of Foreigner fame. Joel also brought in some fresh faces to join the band, including talented multi-instrumentalist Crystal Taliefero, who would go on to become Joel's musical director and architect of his live sound. After ""We Didn't Start The Fire,"" Storm Front also produced the hit ""I Go To Extremes."" The album was also notable for its song ""Leningrad,"" written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city during his tour in 1987, and ""The Downeaster Alexa,"" written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album was the ballad ""And So It Goes.""

In 1992, Joel sued former manager and ex-brother-in-law Frank Weber (ex-wife Elizabeth's brother) for $95 million after accounting irregularities were discovered. The case later settled out of court. 

*River of Dreams (1993)
Joel started work on River of Dreams in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by Christie Brinkley that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The eponymous first single was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date. The album includes hits such as ""The River of Dreams"", ""All About Soul"", ""The Great Wall of China"", and ""Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)"", written for his daughter, Alexa. A radio remix version of ""All About Soul"" can be found on ""The Essential Billy Joel"" (2001).

In August 1995, Billy Joel's long-time bassist Doug Stegmeyer committed suicide in his Long Island home. Stegmeyer had played on every one of Joel's albums from Turnstiles through The Bridge.

In 1999 Joel performed at New York's Madison Square Garden on the eve of the new millennium which at the time was considered to be Joel's last solo concert, The concert (dubbed The Night Of The 2000 Years) ran on close to 4 hours and was later released as 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert

In 2001 Joel released Fantasies & Delusions, a collection of classical piano pieces. All were written by Billy Joel and performed by Richard Joo. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances. The album topped the classical charts at # 1. On September 21, 2001, Joel performed ""New York State of Mind"" live as part of the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert.

Joel has toured extensively with Elton John on a series of ""Face to Face"" tours. During these shows, the two have played each other's songs and performed duets.

In 2005, Columbia released a box set, My Lives, which is largely a compilation of demos, B-tracks, and live/alternate versions to hit songs. The compilation also includes the Umixit software, in which people can remix ""Zanzibar"", ""Only The Good Die Young"", ""Keepin' The Faith"", and live versions of ""I Go To Extremes"" and ""Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)"" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the River of Dreams tour is included.

On January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the United States. Having not written any new songs, he featured a sampling of all his songs in his career, including his major hits. His tour includes an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

On June 13, 2006, Joel released ""12 Gardens: Live"", a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during his 2006 tour.

The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native, Bruce Springsteen, when he played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena.

The record has consequently earned Joel the only retired number in the arena owned by a non-athlete. The retired number, which was 12, hangs in the rafters along with many others such as hockey great Mark Messier.

2006 also saw Billy Joel visit the United Kingdom and Ireland (as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour) for the first time in many years, playing to capacity crowds in Birmingham, Sheffield, Southampton, Manchester, Glasgow, London and Dublin.

On July 31, 2006, Joel performed a free concert in Rome, Italy with the Colosseum as the backdrop, and performed classic hits for hundreds of thousands of fans. Joel performed favorites such as ""New York State of Mind,"" ""Honesty,"" and ""Just the Way You Are.""

While introducing one song, the 57-year-old singer joked in shaky Italian, ""This song is as old as the Colosseum.""

Organizers estimated 500,000 people turned out for the show. The concert was opened by Canadian pop-rocker and songwriter Bryan Adams.

Billy Joel will tour South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006.

Joel's lyrics have made many references to locations in the New York City metropolitan area, particularly Long Island. For example, the ""Miracle Mile"" line in 1980's ""It's Still Rock & Roll to Me"" refers to the affluent shopping district located on Northern Boulevard in the community of Manhasset and 1980's ""You May Be Right"" references walking through the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn alone as proof of craziness. In his 1973 song ""The Ballad of Billy the Kid,"" he describes a certain ""Billy"" as being from the town of Oyster Bay, the municipality in which the hamlet of Hicksville is located. He has since stated, in the liner notes from his album Songs in the Attic, that this ""Billy"" is not himself, but rather an Oyster Bay bartender.

Several of Joel's songs have grown out of specific personal experiences, including ""Piano Man,"" which he wrote describing his regular job playing at a Los Angeles piano bar in the early 1970s, and ""Scenes From An Italian Restaurant,"" purportedly written about either the Syosset mainstay Christiano's or a similar eatery in New York City's Little Italy. His song ""Vienna"" was supposedly written about a visit to his father in Europe, while ""Big Shot"" was based on a bad date with Mick Jagger's ex-wife Bianca.

In a Playboy interview, Joel indicated that ""Rosalinda's Eyes"" was penned for his mother, Rosalinda, as the song his father should have written for her.

""Only The Good Die Young"" created a bit of a stir within the religious community when it was first released in 1977. Some radio stations even refused to give the song any airtime. It is said that while Joel was doing a show in St. Louis, he had been specifically asked not to perform the song during the show and even received death threats; in response, Joel played it twice. Joel has said about the song that ""the point of the song wasn't so much anti-Catholic as [it was] pro-lust"".

His music reflects influences from many different genres including European classical composers, Aaron Copland, 1950s doo wop, Broadway/Tin Pan Alley, jazz, blues, punk, ska, gospel, pop, and even Russian folk songs, to straight-up rock & roll. This has, in part, led to his broad success over a long period of time, but made him difficult to categorize in popular music today.

In the mid 1970s, the touring and studio lineup of Joel's band stabilized. The main lineup consisted of:

Billy Joel - lead vocals, piano, synthesizer, organ, harmonica 
Liberty DeVitto — drums, percussion 
Doug Stegmeyer — bass guitar, backing vocals 
Russell Javors — rhythm guitars, backing vocals 
David Brown — lead guitars 
Richie Cannata — saxophones, flute, clarinet, organ, percussion, backing vocals 
This was also the lineup for Joel's first live album, Songs In The Attic.

The 1980s and 1990s saw significant changes to Joel's band. By the River of Dreams tour the only remaining long standing member of the band was DeVitto on drums. Multi-instrumentalists Crystal Taliefero and Mark Rivera joined and remain in his band to this day. Rivera had taken over the prominent saxophone solo in the song ""New York State of Mind"" that had previously been performed by Cannata (and was re-recorded by Rivera for the Greatest Hits version of the song). The 1993 River of Dreams tour saw the addition of Dave Rosenthal on keyboards who also remains with the band. Tommy Byrnes has become a frequent band member on guitar and was both a musical consultant and band member in the Movin' Out musical. For the 2006 tour, Joel did not invite DeVitto back as drummer. Chuck Burgi (from the Broadway production of Joel's musical 'Movin' Out') replaced DeVitto. Richie Cannata returns on saxophones, along with Mark Rivera and Crystal Taliefero, with Cannata again performing the ""New York State Of Mind"" solo.


Despite having never graduated from high school, Joel has been presented with multiple honorary doctorates:

Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Syracuse University
Doctor of Humane Letters from Fairfield University (1991) 
Doctor from Berklee College of Music (1993) 
Doctor of Humane Letters from Hofstra University (1997) 
Doctor of Music from Southampton College (2000) 
Doctor of Fine Arts from Syracuse University (2006)[8] 

Joel was also named MusiCares Person of the Year for 2002, an award given each year at the same time as the Grammy Awards. At the dinner honoring Joel, various artists performed versions of his songs including Nelly Furtado, Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi, Diana Krall, Rob Thomas, and Natalie Cole. He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on Oct 15, 2006.

In 2004, Joel married 23 year-old Katie Lee. Lee is a graduate of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. At the time of the wedding, Joel was 54. Joel's daughter, Alexa Ray, 18, served as maid of honor. Joel's second wife, Christie Brinkley, attended the union and gave the couple her blessing. Lee works as a restaurant correspondent for the PBS show, George Hirsch: Living it Up!. In 2006, Katie Lee hosted Bravo's Top Chef.

In 2002 he crashed his car in East Hampton, New York, and soon after entered Silver Hill Hospital, a substance abuse and psychiatric center in New Canaan, Connecticut. In 2003 Joel crashed his car into a tree in eastern Long Island, and was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital. In April 2004, Joel crashed his car into a house on Long Island. In March 2005 Joel checked into a Betty Ford rehabilitation center[12], where he spent 30 days. 

Movin' Out (2002), is a musical based on twenty-four Billy Joel songs which was a smash hit on Broadway from 2002 to 2005 (last Broadway show was on December 11, 2005). Joel was composer, lyricist, and orchestrator; Tony Award for Best Orchestrations. The musical is really a dance performance choreographed by famed choreographer Twyla Tharp, with Joel's songs sung by Michael Cavanaugh.

Rise Against,"Rise Against are a punk/melodic hardcore band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1999, and originally performing under the name Transistor Revolt, they released a self-produced demo entitled Transistor Revolt in 2000, a year before signing with Fat Wreck Chords to release their first two albums, The Unraveling in 2001, and Revolutions Per Minute in 2003. They later switched to Dreamworks Records and recorded their album Siren Song of the Counter Culture. However, Universal Music Group took over Dreamworks Records and Rise Against finally found themselves on Geffen Records, a Universal Music Group subsidiary, releasing Siren Song of the Counter Culture in August 2004. A re-issued version of The Unraveling was released on August 23, 2005 through Fat Wreck Chords. They released their 4th studio album entitled ""The Sufferer and The Witness"" on July 4th 2006.

Rise Against's original lineup consisted of Tim McIlrath (vocals and guitar), Joe Principe (bass and vocals, formerly from 88-Fingers Louie), Brandon Barnes (drums), and Mr.Precision (guitar and vocals), and recorded its debut album with renowned punk producer Mass Giorgini. Mr. Precision left the band in 2001 and was replaced by Todd Mohney, the guitarist of McIlrath's side project The Killing Tree. Shortly after the band signed with Geffen, Mohney left and was replaced by Chris Chasse.   Mohney would become part of the punk supergroup The Falcon along with members from other popular Chicago punk acts, Alkaline Trio and The Lawrence Arms.  After the release of the The Sufferer and The Witness, Chasse left the band due to the ""overwhelming tour schedule stacked on growing pressures and demands"" (he is now in the bands Last Of the Believers and Nations Afire; in his place now stands Zach Blair of Only Crime. According to a statement by McIlrath, ""Yes, the Rise Against curse continues...""

Various musical influences are apparent in their songs on Siren Song of the Counter Culture. The opening song, ""State of the Union"", is comparable to classic hardcore. As an introductory song, it is supposed to make the listener wake up. ""To Them These Streets Belong"" and ""The First Drop"" are more typical of the traditional punk in the style of Pennywise. Most of their lyrics include a political message of some sort. The aforementioned ""Swing Life Away"" is slow-paced song, originally recorded for the Punk Goes Acoustic compilation album.

The band had a slow but steady rise in popularity, with each album building on the popularity of the previous and bringing them to a new level of mainstream awareness, beginning with their independent label debut The Unraveling to their latest major label offering, Appeal to Reason, which had the band make their signature sound slightly more accessible and offered them their heaviest airplay to date and is their highest-charting album.

The members of Rise Against are straight edge (with the exception of Barnes), and are all either vegetarian or vegan. They have toured recently with Bad Religion and My Chemical Romance and have made several tours around the US and Europe.

On October 7th of 2008, they released their 5th album called ""Appeal to Reason"". This was the first album with new comer guitarist Zach Blair, formerly from Only Crime. The single ""Re-Education (Through Labor)"" was released on August 19 of 2008 and is available for listening on the band's official website. 

       Rise Against began recording a new album entitled Endgame in February of 2010.  They released Endgame, their 6th album, on March 15, 2011.

The band's typical lyrical themes include DIY, animal rights, anti-establishment, social issues, society issues and straight edge life. They are influenced by bands like Bad Religion, NOFX, Anti-Flag, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, Minor Threat and Nirvana. The band is known for playing hardcore punk, melodic hardcore, punk rock. Siren Song of the Counter Culture went gold, and Endgame went platinum.

As of Mid-2013, they have released a compilation album, Long Forgotten Songs: B-sides and Covers, for sale exclusively on their website for a limited time in bundle packages along with other merchandise such as sweatshirts. The album contains songs, both originals and covers, that were recorded but never released on an official Rise Against album, such as ""Generation Lost"", which was instead put on the compilation album ""Uncontrollable Fatulence"" by Fat Wreck Chords. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rise+Against"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lykke Li,"Lykke Li (born Li Lykke Timotej Svensson Zachrisson on 18 March 1986 in Ystad, Sweden) is a Swedish singer-songwriter. Her music often blends elements of pop, indie rock and electronic; various instruments can also be found in her songs, including violins, synthesizers, tambourines, trumpets, saxophones and cellos. Li possesses the vocal range of a soprano.

Incubus,"There are 8 known bands with this name:
1. A popular alternative rock band from California, United States
2. A thrash metal band from Louisiana, United States
3. A thrash metal band from Georgia, United States
4. A thrash metal band from Sao Paulo, Brazil
5. A thrash metal band from Joao Pessoa, Brazil
6. A heavy metal band from the United Kingdom

1. Incubus is a five-man alternative rock band formed in 1991, based in Calabasas, California. Members include Brandon Boyd (vocals and percussion), Mike Einziger (guitar), Ben Kenney (bass), Jose Pasillas II (drums) and DJ Chris Kilmore (turntables). Former members of the band include Gavin Koppel (a.k.a. DJ Lyfe) (turntables) and Alex Katunich (a.k.a. Dirk Lance) (bass). The band's name may seem a peculiar choice to fans, as an incubus is a type of demon that, in mythological lore, comes in the night and has sex with women while they are sleeping; it seduces them in their dreams The story behind the name is that the band needed to think of a name hours before their first show and, after a few failed choices, Mike looked in a dictionary and chose ""Incubus"" almost at random. Mike says that the name was chosen because it sounded silly; Brandon holds that it was chosen because they were teenagers and the definition had the word ""sex"" in it. ""We really didn't want to rape women in their sleep. But, we were fifteen and it seemed harmless to us then, and we never changed it,"" says the band.

Incubus has received both critical acclaim and commercial success, reaching multi-platinum sales, as well as releasing several successful singles. The band earned mainstream recognition with the release of their 1999 album Make Yourself. In 2001, Incubus became even more successful with the single ""Drive"" and their follow-up album Morning View. Their sixth studio album, Light Grenades, debuted at No. 1 in 2006 and has received Gold certification in the U.S. Incubus released their first greatest hits album Monuments and Melodies in June 2009, accompanied by a tour of the United States, Japan and Canada.

a-ha,"a-ha is a Norwegian new wave band. The trio, composed of lead vocalist Morten Harket, guitarist Paul Waaktaar-Savoy and keyboardist Magne Furuholmen, formed in 1982 and left Oslo, Norway for London in order to make a career in the music business. 

The origin of the name a-ha comes from the lyric of an early song. After checking dictionaries in several languages, they found out that 'a-ha' was an international way of expressing recognition, with positive connotations. It was short, a-ha was easy to say and somewhat unusual.

The first song to break through into the mainstream culture was Take On Me, which was featured on the album Hunting High And Low; a main reason for its popularity was the music video that came some time later after the song's release.
""Take on Me"" was the first song Morten Harket heard Magne Furuholmen and Paul Waaktaar-Savoy play. At that time the song was called ""Lesson One."" After multiple re-recordings and two failed releases, ""Take on Me"" became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1985. Although their first release of the song in 1984 was not a major success, it was remixed by producer Alan Tarney a year later, and sold 1.5 million copies worldwide in one week. Eventually the single ""Take on Me"" is estimated to have sold 7-9 million copies worldwide; it peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number two in the UK Singles Chart. Sales were aided in the U.S. by a music video on MTV that mimicked the truck chase from Terry Gilliam's movie Brazil and the climactic scene from the Ken Russell film Altered States. The video used a sketchy animation / live action combination called ""Rotoscoping"" that tells a fantasy thriller story to the song. At the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards ""Take on Me"" won in six categories. It was also nominated for Best Video of the Year at 1986 American Music Awards.

The follow-up single to ""Take on Me"" was ""The Sun Always Shines on T.V."". In the U.S., the song peaked at number twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number seventeen on Radio & Records airplay chart. In addition, the music video for the song won in two categories at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards. 
a-ha's American success culminated in their 1986 Grammy nomination in a coveted Best New Artist category which was eventually won by Sade.

""The Sun Always Shines on TV"" turned out to be A-ha's last Billboard Top 40 single, and to this day in the United States a-ha is mostly remembered by the general public only because of the singularly huge success of ""Take on Me"". Hunting High and Low (1985), which contained ""The Sun Always Shines on TV"" and ""Take on Me,"" was a worldwide bestseller. In the U.S., it sold more than a million copies and acquired platinum certification by RIAA. As of 2005, Hunting High and Low has sold 8 million copies worldwide.

a-ha's second album was Scoundrel Days (1986) and represented a move towards alternative rock as synthpop began to fall out of style. In 1987, they provided the title song for the James Bond film The Living Daylights. Stay on These Roads (1988) received more mixed reviews than the previous albums. In spite of a drastic decline in sales in the next few years, a-ha continued to record two more albums, East of the Sun, West of the Moon (1990) and Memorial Beach (1993). East of the Sun, West of the Moon featured a cover version of The Everly Brothers 1963 single, ""Crying in the Rain"".

Because of apparent internal conflicts between the band members and conflict with the record label at the time, A-ha split in 1994 and their members started focusing on solo activities, but came together in 1994 to perform for the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. This performance included their song composed for the Winter Paralympics, ""Shapes That Go Together"".

After a very well-received performance of ""The Sun Always Shines on TV"" and a new song, ""Summer Moved On"", at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998, the band returned to the studio and recorded 2000's Minor Earth Major Sky, which resulted in a new tour, and a videocast performance of a-ha (with Briskeby) opening the new Vallhall stadium in Oslo. Sales of this album and 2002's Lifelines showed that their fanbase was still there, and also that they were able to attract new audiences, especially in Central Europe and Scandinavia, where the albums sold extremely well. They appeared again at the Nobel Peace Prize concert in 2001. a-ha's music video for the song, ""I Wish I Cared"" was the first fully web-based animated flash music video to be made available.

A live album (from their 2002 tour) with the title How Can I Sleep With Your Voice in My Head? was released in March of 2003, preceded by a live single of the 1986 classic ""The Sun Always Shines on TV"".

In 2004, an in-depth book entitled ""The Swing Of Things"" was published, also featuring a CD of early demo material. In 2004, a-ha celebrated their twentieth anniversary with the release of a new singles collection: The Definitive Singles Collection 1984-2004. This compilation brought them back into the UK Top 20 Album Charts, where they reached number thirteen. Over their career, a-ha have officially released 32 singles. 13 of these became top ten singles in the UK, and 14 singles have been number one on the radio lists over the world. The compilation included some of the highlights from a-ha’s last 20 years.

In September, a-ha returned to the U.S. (at Irving Plaza in New York City) for the band's first concert on American soil since 1986. A short impromptu performance of ""Take on Me"" occurred on September 11 in Times Square. On August 27, 2005, the band played a concert for 120,000 people in Frognerparken in Oslo, the largest concert ever in Norway.

On November 4, 2005, the band released its new studio album, Analogue. The first single ""Celice"" was released on October 4 in mainland Europe. Later that same month, a tour followed, with concerts in Brussels, France, Germany and the UK. The release of the track, ""Analogue (All I Want)"" followed in the UK in January 2006, giving a-ha its first top ten hit in the UK since 1988. The third single in Europe (second in the UK) from the album was the Magne Furuholmen penned ""Cosy Prisons"", already a live-staple in the band's set.

On the 30 October 2006 in London a-ha received the prestigious Q Inspiration Award for its long contribution to music and for inspiring many of their younger colleagues in the business.

In 2007 a-ha recorded a cover of John Lennon's ""#9 Dream"" for Amnesty International.

A ninth studio album, Foot Of The Mountain, was released in the summer of 2009. This more synth oriented album got a number five position in the UK in August 2009, and was No. 11 on the European album charts.

""Norway's most successful band through the years is splitting up for good!
After 9 studio albums with over 35 million albums sold, it`s over for the band.""

A-ha had a press conference in Cologne 26.10.09, the day before their last world tour kick-off in Lanxess Arena. The last concert was in Oslo Norway. The concert ion 4 December 2010 at the Oslo Spektrum. 

On March 21, 2015, it was confirmed in national Norwegian newspapers that a-ha has reunited for a two-year period and are currently writing new material. a-ha's tenth studio album, Cast in Steel, is scheduled to be released on September 4, 2015.

The Neighbourhood,"The Neighbourhood are an American alternative rock/dark pop band that formed in Newbury Park, California, USA in August 2011. The band consists of Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Freedman, Zach Abels, Mikey Margott and Brandon Fried. Bryan Sammis (drums) left the group in January, 2014.

The band released their first EP, I'm Sorry... in January 2013, where their single Sweater Weather reached #1 on the U.S. Alternative Tracks and #8 on the U.S. Rock Tracks and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted at #68 in Canada. Their first album, I Love You. was released on April 23, 2013. 

In early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track titled ""Female Robbery."" Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. They were from California despite the British spelling of their name. They had a second track, ""Sweater Weather,"" which had an accompanying -- and equally dark -- video.

Although The Neighbourhood's identity remained hazy, it became clear that the music they were making felt transformative to critics and fans alike. The evocative combination of rock instruments with R&B and hip-hop aesthetics seemed, in many ways, revelatory, a reimagining of sounds that seemed to make people clamor for more information with even greater fervor. In April, BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe, an early champion of the group, let it slip that The Neighbourhood was the handiwork of musician Jesse Rutherford, a resident of Newbury Park, CA. By early May, as the band unveiled a free, self-released EP titled ""I'm Sorry,"" it became understood that the identity of this young band was, ultimately, secondary to the music itself.

So who are The Neighbourhood? In essence, the group, which formed in August of 2011, is a collection of five friends who make music together. They're headed by Rutherford, a 21-year-old singer who has dabbled in various genres, including hip-hop, before crafting the merge of sounds that categorizes The Neighbourhood's style. Their debut EP produced by Justyn Pilbrow, who brought Emile Haynie onboard to collaborate on ""Female Robbery."" The EP, recorded at the end of last year, is composed of shadowy, emotional music with visuals to match. And it's all part of the band's master plan.

""I always have a strong vision before I go into anything,"" Rutherford says. ""I don't know how to make music any other way. It was all in my head, and that vision for the music was to make hip-hop beats with guitars and I was going to sing and rap over them. We wanted to do that hip-hop aesthetic on an indie platform.""

""I'm Sorry,"" a five-song disc, is a precursor to the band's debut album, which is also being produced by Pilbrow and Haynie. The album, expected out March 2013, will expand the group's moody sensibility, which pairs brooding layers of instrumentals with Rutherford's hip-hop-inspired croon. The style, which the band has dubbed ""black and white"" due to its confident inspirations, is based largely in rhythm, as evidenced by the EP. ""When I started in music I started doing drums and then I started doing vocals,"" Rutherford explains. ""And then I combined the two together because to me rapping is just rhythmic vocals. I think the rhythm of hip-hop is really what got me into it. It's not just words being said; it's about how the words are said.""

In the end, all you need to know about The Neighbourhood is in that music and in those words. There are more facts, more pieces of the puzzle, more information to unveil. But what's the fun in being given the full picture when you can slowly discover it for yourself? It's better to leave some mystery lingering. Because, after all, it's that unknowing that brought The Neighbourhood to people's attention to begin with. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Neighbourhood"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Opeth,"Opeth is a progressive metal band from Sweden that is influenced by many diverse musical styles ranging from jazz, 1970s progressive rock, death metal, and blues. Their recent releases have deviated from their traditional death metal influenced style, with more emphasis on progressive elements. Vocalist Mikael Åkerfeldt is also noted for utilizing both clean singing and death growls, often in the same track. Due to their unique blend of melodic and progressive elements, Opeth are often classified separately from more typical death metal acts. The name Opeth was taken from Wilbur Smith's novel Sunbird and derived from Opet, a city of the moon named in the novel.

History

Opeth was formed in Stockholm, Södermanland, Sweden in 1990 by David Isberg. Isberg invited Mikael Åkerfeldt to join the band at a practice session as a bass player, but failed to inform the current bass player or any of the other members of the band. Because of this, all band members except for Isberg quit, and Åkerfeldt soon joined Opeth after his band, Eruption, faltered. With Åkerfeldt on guitar and David Isberg on vocals, Opeth still lacked members and needing more, they were soon joined by long-time friend of Åkerfeldt and former Eruption drummer Anders Nordin and Nick Döring on bass. Andreas Dimeo was recruited as a second guitarist. Rehearsing in an elementary school with old equipment they had found, this lineup lasted less than a year and only played one show. In 1991 they spent the summer rehearsing on the island of Hamnholmen outside Stockholm with their old school friend and bass player Max Jaderberg, who suggested a more prominent bass sound.

After their first performance, Andreas Dimeo and Nick Döring quit the band. For the second performance, guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan DeFarfalla joined the group. After the show, DeFarfalla left to spend time with his girlfriend and did not return until 1994. Pettersson stuck with the band for another show before leaving in late 1991. DaFarfall was replaced by Peter Lindgren, playing the bass. However, once Pettersson left, Lindgren returned to the guitar, his original instrument. Isberg left the band in early 1992 due to creative differences and boredom. Since Mikael had previous experience as a vocalist from fronting Eruption, he became the new vocalist and immediately began writing material with Peter Lindgren. They rehearsed as a 3-piece for more than a year but eventually found a new bass player, Stefan Guteklint, who was dismissed by the band before they signed their record contract with Candlelight Records.

Impressed by their originality, Candlelight Records released their debut full-length Orchid in 1995. It featured a rhythm section of bassist Johan DeFarfalla and drummer Anders Nordin. Dan Swanö, of Edge of Sanity fame, produced the band's ambitious second album Morningrise in 1996. After this Opeth embarked on a brief tour with Morbid Angel. Century Media took notice and not only licensed Opeth's first two albums for the United States, but also planned on releasing their next album on both sides of the Atlantic.

The next album would introduce a change in style as well as line-up. With the recruitment of bassist Martin Mendez to replace DeFarfalla and drummer Martin Lopez (ex-Amon Amarth) replacing Nordin, Opeth's third album, entitled My Arms, Your Hearse, was released in 1998 to glowing reviews, establishing the band as a leading force in progressive metal with death roots. The album is conceptually based on a character who dies and returns to Earth as a ghost.  

1999's Still Life displayed even more of the band's progressive rock influences, and the following year the band played its first U.S. concert at the Milwaukee Metalfest. This was the first album on which Martin Mendez contributed. Like My Arms, Your Hearse before it, Still Life is also a concept album, revolving around a man who is banished from his village for dissenting religious beliefs. The album then then regals the tale of his courtship of the character Melinda. 

Their next album, Blackwater Park, was released in early 2001 and was titled after an obscure psychedelic progressive rock band from the '70s. Blackwater Park is considered to be Opeth's magnum opus and the defining document of their career. The album created a huge buzz among progressive metal fans, who had begun to lump the band in with other experimental metal bands like Tiamat. It was the first of three albums that Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree fame would produce. Wilson also contributed backing vocals and guitar. 

Instead of waiting until the buzz died down, the band released Deliverance (also known as D1) in the fall of 2002, which was intended to be a double album, Damnation (or D2) comprising the other half. Deliverance presented the typical death metal aspect of Opeth while Damnation presented a new side of Opeth: the album that was almost completely devoid of any heavy metal trappings and focused instead on acoustic instruments and traditional songwriting. Steven Wilson again contributed by co-authoring one song, Death Whispered a Lullaby, and by providing backing vocals and playing mellotron, piano, electric piano, keyboards, and guitar.

Opeth then released a DVD, ""Lamentations"", filmed in England during the Damnation Tour, in fall of '03. It featured the Damnation album in its entirety along with some highlights from the previous two albums. Now signed to the major label Roadrunner Records, Opeth's next album Ghost Reveries arrived in 2005 and proved to be a return to form for the band. Shortly before the recordings of this album, Per Wiberg (Spiritual Beggars) officially joined the band to play keyboards, as he did on the tour that supported Damnation. He can also be seen on the ""Lamentations"" DVD. More lineup changes followed in May of 2006, when long time drummer Martin Lopez left the band due to complications from a rare disease he has. After a short delay, he was replaced by Martin Axe Axenrot, former drummer of Bloodbath.

On May 17th, 2007, an open letter from Peter Lindgren was posted on the official Opeth website where he wrote that he had decided to leave the band. He said that he had lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown to become a world-wide industry. It was especially the massive amount of touring, and being away from home for long periods of time that caused this decision. ""I have come to a point where I realise I won't be able to give the band 100%, and from both sides this will not be good enough for what Opeth stands for."" On the same day Fredrik Åkesson (ex-Arch Enemy, Krux) was announced as the new guitar-player and full-time member of Opeth.

In Fall 2007, Opeth released their first live album, The Roundhouse Tapes, recorded in the famous Roundhouse concert hall in Great Britain.

The progressive rock/metal band Dream Theater announced in November of 2007 that Opeth would be joining them on the Progressive Nation 2008 tour. Joining these two bands were Between the Buried and Me and 3.

Opeth's ninth studio album, entitled Watershed was released on June 3, 2008. It was well received by most fans and critics. The first single from the album, Porcelain Heart, was released on April 19th, 2008. The track The Lotus Eater is also available on RoadRunner Record's website for free.

Kasabian,"Kasabian are a rock band from Leicester, England, United Kingdom. The band consists of Tom Meighan (vocals), Sergio Pizzorno (guitar, synths, vocals), Christopher Edwards (bass),  Ian Matthews (drums) and guitarist Tim Carter. The band has been compared with the likes of Primal Scream, with their similar electronica-indie rock fusion and Oasis, with whom they share their confidence, vision, swagger and rough vocal style.

The band formed in 1997 in Leicester, England and are named after Linda Kasabian, who was the getaway driver at the Tate-LaBianca murders committed by members of the Manson Family. Their eponymous first album was released in 2004 and received average reviews. However, tracks such as Cutt Off and L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever) reached the UK Top 10, and with two more Top 20 hits and the album peaking at #4 in the UK Album Chart, they defied the critics.

The second album, Empire, was released on the 28th of August 2006. The first single from the album, also titled Empire, was widely regarded as a musical success, with its change of beat and its catchy chorus. This was then followed by the release of the singles Shoot The Runner and Me Plus One.

The third album, West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum, was released on the 5th of June 2009. The hit single off the album Fire reached #3 in the Official UK Singles Chart, making it the band's highest charting single to date.

Switchblade Smiles, the first track released from Kasabian's fourth album, Velociraptor!, was debuted during Zane Lowe's show on BBC Radio 1 on June 7, 2011. The album was released in September 2011 and became Kasabian's third consecutive #1 album in the UK. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kasabian"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Beach House,"Beach House is a dream pop group that formed in 2005 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The group consists of Victoria Legrand (vocals, organ) and Alex Scally (guitar, keyboards). Legrand is the niece of French composer Michel Legrand. The group has released six albums: ""Beach House"" (2006), ""Devotion"" (2008), ""Teen Dream"" (2010), ""Bloom"" (2012), ""Depression Cherry"" (2015) and ""Thank Your Lucky Stars"" (2015).

Within a year of formation, the group charmed indie music enthusiasts across the blogosphere with their languid songcraft, while the eerie warmth of ""Apple Orchard"" landed on Pitchfork's Infinite Mixtape MP3 series in August 2006. Two months later, Beach House issued their eponymous debut album for Carpark. Fall shows with labelmates Over the Atlantic were also scheduled.

Victoria can also be heard on Frenemies' Birds in High School album.  She and Chris Freeland created harmonies on the song Waiting for the Ambulance. Victoria can also be heard on Grizzly Bear's 2009 release ""Veckatimest"" and she sings on ""Slow Life"", a Grizzly Bear track featured on the official soundtrack for Twilight: New Moon.

In September of 2009 Sub Pop Records announced that Beach House had signed and that a follow up album to 2008's ""Devotion"", ""Teen Dream""  would be released in early 2010.

Beach House was featured as a cover story in a January 2010 issue of the Washington Post magazine.

The Verve,"The Verve (originally Verve) is an English alternative rock band. The band was formed in 1989 at Winstanley College, Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, by vocalist Richard Ashcroft, guitarist Nick McCabe, bassist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury. Simon Tong later became a member. The band originally split in 1995, but reunited in 1996 to great commercial success. They split once more in April 1999. The band reunited once more in June of 2007, but this reunion was short lived and the band split again in August 2009.

Beginning with a psychedelic sound indebted to space rock and shoegazer music, by the mid-1990s the band had released several EPs and two acclaimed records. They also endured name and lineup changes, breakups, health problems, drug abuse and various lawsuits. The band's commercial breakthrough was urban hymns and its single Bittersweet Symphony, which became a massive worldwide hit.

Soon after this commercial peak, the band quit amid creative struggles within, and Ashcroft went onto a successful solo career. Tong briefly joined Blur as a replacement for Graham Coxon. It is rumored that Simon Jones did a studio album with Ari Pap of the Floor Monks called 'Aint Nothing To It' and was never released because they both had bigger projects going on at the time. Close family and friends assure us its a fabulous indie/rock/alternate album and they really wish it would have been released.

The Verve were chosen to close the 2008 Glastonbury festival which they did with a set based on the classic 1997 album 'Urban Hymns'.

The logo was primarily used for promotion of the band's debut, whereas for A Beautiful Lie, the new Trinity logo was created consisting of three skulls, along with the band's name and motto. For This Is War, the band has adopted the alchemical symbol for air, continuing on the sky/air theme.

The Echelon
The Echelon is a publicity street team for the band 30 Seconds to Mars, which helps in bringing friends to the shows, phoning local radio stations to request the band's songs, putting up posters, posting to band forums or related bulletin boards online, voting for the band in official award nominations and maintaining magazines or websites dedicated to the band. It is also the name of one of their songs in the album 30 Seconds to Mars.

Studio albums:
30 Seconds to Mars - 2002

Their debut self-titled album, 30 Seconds to Mars, released on August 27, 2002 in the United States through Immortal and Virgin. Jared Leto described the record as a concept album that focuses on human struggle and self-determination, in which otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas are used to illustrate a truthful personal situation. The album reached #107 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers, selling 121,000 copies in the United States alone. It was preceded by the single ""Capricorn (A Brand New Name)"", which peaked at number 31 on the US Mainstream Rock chart and entered the top ten of the UK Rock Chart. Upon its release, 30 Seconds to Mars was met with mostly positive reviews; a critic felt that the band has ""managed to carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm."" Although the album was a slow-burning success, it eventually sold two million copies worldwide as of March 2011.


A Beautiful Lie - 2005
A Beautiful Lie was released on August 30, 2005 in the United States. Because the album was leaked five months before its release, the band decided to include two bonus tracks: ""Battle of One"" (an original song that was also set to be the album's title track when it was first announced) and ""Hunter"" (a cover of the Björk song).

It has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has reached platinum and gold status in several countries, with a sales total of over four million. It was led by ""Attack"", which made its radio debut on June 6, 2005 and became the most added track on American modern rock radio during its first week of release. 

During 2005, Thirty Seconds to Mars released the album's second single, ""The Kill"", which set a record for the longest-running hit in the history of the US Modern Rock chart when it remained on the national chart for more than 50 weeks, following its number three peak in 2006. Its music video, directed by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins, received a largely positive response and numerous accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award.


This Is War - 2009
This is War released through Virgin Records and EMI on December 8, 2009. Upon its release, it peaked at #18 on the Billboard 200.

Leto described the style as ""much more electronic and experimental, with lots of vintage synths."" Leto also mentioned that he had written lyrics about some themes he felt were missing from their previous work, such as optimism and sexuality only for the song ""Stranger in a Strange Land"".

The music video for the song ""Hurricane"" was banned by MTV and several other TV channels around the world. The video, which runs for 13 minutes and 10 seconds and was directed by Jared Leto under the pseudonym Bartholomew Cubbin, premiered on MTV on November 29, 2010. The video was censored and banned because of its elements of violence, nudity and sex. On November 28, 2010, Jared Leto posted the letter from MTV about the censorship of the video on his blog. The list features the offending scenes, such as a woman running her finger on the anus of another G-string woman, which was classified as ""restricted"". It was only this shot which had made the video completely restricted.


Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams - 2013
Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (stylized as LOVE LUST FAITH + DREAMS) was released through Virgin Records on May 17, 2013. Upon release, peaked #6 on the Billboard 200 and sold 52,000 copies in its first week of release.

Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams is a concept album revolving around the themes after which the album is named. The album is divided into four segments, each named Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, with the beginning of each segment declared by a female voice proclaiming the name of the segment before the beginning of a song or at the end of an interlude which introduces the next segment of the album.

A more specific album concept can be seen inside the CD. It is recognized by four colors, with the color red standing for Love, yellow for Lust, green for Faith, and blue for Dreams. LOVE contains ""Birth"" and ""Conquistador"". LUST contains ""Up in the Air"", ""City of Angels"", ""The Race"", ""End of All Days"" and ""Pyres of Varanasi"". FAITH contains ""Bright Lights"", ""Do or Die"" and ""Convergence"". DREAMS contains ""Northern Lights"", and ""Depuis Le Début"".

""Up in the Air"" was released as the lead single from Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams on March 19, 2013. A CD copy of the single was sent to NASA and SpaceX for launch aboard the Dragon spacecraft on SpaceX CRS-2. The mission was launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket on March 1, 2013, sending the first ever commercial copy of music into space. The spacecraft berthed and docked with the International Space Station on March 3, 2013, making the single available to play by the Expedition 35 crew aboard the station. The song made its worldwide debut aboard the station on March 18, 2013 and was released as a Digital download single on iTunes the next day. The music video was released on April 19, 2013 worldwide on Vevo.

""City of Angels"" was sent to US Modern rock radio as a promotional single from Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams on July 23, 2013. A music video for ""City of Angels"", featuring Bartholomew Cubbins as director, was released onto YouTube on October 29, 2013. It was shot over two days on August 18 and 19, 2013, in Los Angeles, California.

""Do or Die"" was released as a promotional single from Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams on September 9, 2013 in Europe. During the Summer European Tour, Jared confirmed the band was recording footage for a live video for the song. The music video was released on August 5, 2013 worldwide on Vevo.

Kaiser Chiefs,"Kaiser Chiefs are a post-britpop band which formed in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England in early 2003. The band consists of Ricky Wilson (vocals), Andrew ""Whitey"" White (guitar), Simon Rix (bass), Nick ""Peanut"" Baines (keyboards) and Vijay Mistry(drums). Nick Hodgson is the band's former drummer and main songwriter but left the band in December 2012 to focus on other projects. The band has released five albums as of 2014 and have released 16 singles, including the hits I Predict a Riot, Oh My God, Ruby and Never Miss a Beat. 

Several members of the band are ardent fans of the English football team Leeds United (as the band originates from Leeds). The band are named after the South African Kaizer Chiefs Football Club, the former team of long-serving former Leeds captain Lucas Radebe.

The band's main musical influences include The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Kinks, Blur, Eric Burdon, The Jam, and other new wave bands. Andrew White  (b. England; guitar), Ricky Wilson  (b. Charles Richard Wilson, 17 January 1975, Keighley, West Yorkshire, England; vocals), Nick  Baines  (keyboards), Nick Hodgson  (b. Nicholas Hodgson, 20 October 1977, England; drums) and Simon Rix  (b. James Simon Rix, 18 October 1977, England; bass) formed the band in early 2003, having originally played garage rock under the Parva moniker. Their energetic brand of post-millennial guitar rock, which would have been branded ""indie"" in previous decades, quickly found favour on the local gig circuit. The quintet issued their debut, the XTC-soundalike Oh My God, before they had even signed a proper recording contract, teaming up with the Drowned In Sound website in May 2004 for a limited edition release. A contract with the B-Unique label followed and the band began to attract wider interest at the end of 2004 with the release of their storming I Predict A Riot. The topical lyrics, concerning alcohol-fuelled violence in small English towns, attracted as much attention as the band's anarchic update on late 70s new wave.

The band's explosion onto the global music scene in early 2005 was epitomised when they had their first single I Predict A Riot off their debut album Employment played on the radio around the world and opened Live8 in Philadelphia. Several years prior to 2003 the members of the band had been a garage rock group called Parva (before that they had been known as Runston Parva). However, after their label Mantra Records went bust in late 2002, the band went back to their roots and adopted a more britpop sound, helping the band reach their current popularity within the UK and beyond as a consequence.

The band re-released the single Oh My God on 21 February, which charted at #6. The debut album Employment was released on 7 March 2005 and entered the charts at #3 that week. Despite becoming favourite after being shortlisted, the album failed to win the 2005 Mercury Music Prize. They covered the Marvin Gaye classic, Heard it Through the Grapevine for the War Child album Help! A Day in the Life, giving a whole new slant on the song.

A DVD, entitled Enjoyment, was released in November 2005. The basis of the DVD is a (semi-false) documentary about the band narrated by Bill Nighy. It also includes all the promo videos, live performances and more.

An internet-only (so far) music video for their song Sink that Ship has been released in September 2005. The video appears on Electronic Arts' website as a promotional tool for their game Burnout Revenge but is completely unbranded.

Wilson auctioned off his red tambourine to radio show Xfm in late 2005 to raise money for the homeless charity Shelter. The winning bid was £375.00.

On February 5th, The Kaiser Chiefs Released their next single, Ruby, which was a major success reaching #1 in the singles charts.

The Kaiser Chiefs released their new album, Yours Truly, Angry Mob on February 23, 2007 in The Netherlands and Belgium, February 26, 2007 in the United Kingdom and on March 27, 2007 in North America. A double disc edition is also available, the second disc being a DVD.

It is known that three of the band members went to a school near Highroyd, Leeds. Also, Nick (drummer) announced during a gig in Newcastle Upon Tyne that his dad went to a school called St. Cuthberts in Newcastle. Other famous people from that school include Ant & Dec and Sting.

The band released their third album, Off With Their Heads, on October 20, 2008. It contains the hit single Never Miss a Beat.

Songfacts states that the band's fourth album, The Future Is Medieval was released through the band's website on June 3, 2011. In effect the world's first bespoke album, fans are able to create their own version of the record by choosing their favorite 10 tracks from the selection of 20 on offer. One-minute excerpts allow them to make their selections and each song is represented by an object. 
After creating their own album, people can then share their version of the record with other fans, and earn £1 each time it is purchased by someone else.

5th album ""Education, Education, Education and War!"" is set to be released on 31st March 2014 on Fiction Records.

Performances

Kaiser Chiefs' first big festival show was at the dual-site Reading and Leeds Festival on 27 August 2004 and in the following year, on 16 May 2005, they appeared at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, The Netherlands. After that, things went fast. They were the opening act at the Philadelphia Live 8 concert on July 2nd 2005, one of only two British acts in the lineup (Def Leppard being the other). They performed I Predict a Riot, Everyday I Love You Less and Less and Oh My God. They played Reading and Leeds in 2006 before Franz Ferdinand and were extremely popular.

June 2005 saw them headline at the May Ball at Queens' College, Cambridge, supported by Anada, before an acclaimed appearance at a rain-soaked Glastonbury festival during the same month, whilst August's appearance at the V Festival featured a very enthusiastic set despite Ricky Wilson having his leg in plaster. Also more recently they embarked on their own headline UK Tour, supported by Maximo Park and The Cribs. Their first US tour (with The Cribs) ran through the summer of 2005, and they followed it by playing a few shows on the Foozer tour. This was followed up by opening for Foo Fighters during their Australian tour in December 2005. They also played to Jools Holland and his audience on December 31, 2005.

Their song Ruby, from the album Yours Truly, Angry Mob was featured as a bonus song in Guitar Hero III, and I Predict a Riot from Employment was eventually released as downloadable content for the game.

Kaiser Chiefs are set to return to the European festival scene this summer, having been booked for Switzerland's Gurten Festival.

Toto,"Toto is a Grammy Award winning American rock band that was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1977 by David Paich, Steve Lukather, Bobby Kimball, brothers Jeff Porcaro and Steve Porcaro, and David Hungate. The band members had met in high school and at studio sessions in the 1970s, when they became some of the busiest session musicians in the music business.

Composed entirely of seasoned studio musicians, Toto seemed to come out of nowhere. They did not get known first on the club circuit as nearly all bands do prior to being signed by a label. Their reputations in the studio were enough. For example, Paich, Hungate and Jeff Porcaro wrote songs for and performed on Boz Scaggs' album Silk Degrees.

Toto released their debut album Toto in October 1978, selling two million copies based on their top ten hit Hold the Line. The next two albums Hydra and Turn Back had little success, but Toto IV (released in 1982) featured the number one hit Africa as well as the top ten single Rosanna. Toto IV went multi-platinum and earned several Grammy Awards including 1983 Album of the Year and Record of the Year (for ""Rosanna"").

Their only film work to date was for the 1984 David Lynch science fiction film Dune. In addition to their own score, they also recorded the Prophecy Theme, composed by Brian Eno.

After the release of Toto IV, Mike Porcaro (brother to Jeff and Steve), joined the group on bass, replacing Hungate. In 1984, Bobby Kimball left the group after being arrested for selling cocaine and was replaced by Dennis Frederiksen aka Fergie Frederiksen, who was replaced not long after by Joseph Williams.

Steve Porcaro left the band in 1988, however, he still contributes as a sideman.

In 1990, Jean-Michel Byron replaced Williams for the new recordings on Past to Present 1977-1990, then left with Lukather becoming the group's lead singer.

On August 5, 1992, Jeff Porcaro died of a heart attack, days after completing work on Kingdom of Desire. The group considered disbanding, before adding British drummer Simon Phillips for the subsequent tour. In the years since Porcaro's death, Lukather has seemingly succeeded Paich as the band's de facto leader.

In 1999, Bobby Kimball returned to the lineup after a 15-year absence. stoer

Greg Phillinganes joined the lineup in 2004 to fill in for David Paich during a tour, then officially joined Toto in 2005.

After a period of rumours and some allusions, on June 5th, 2008 Steve Lukather made an official announcement on his website stevelukather.net, stating: ""The fact is yes I have left Toto. There is no more Toto."" Lukather further stated that after 31 years of recording, producing and playing with Toto without even missing one single gig, he couldn't do it anymore: ""I just can't do it anymore and at 50 years old I wanted to start over and give it one last try on my own."" With Lukather being the only original member left in the band (Bobby Kimball was also an original member, but was out of the band from 1984-1998) there was no other option than to call it quits. As the main motivation for his decision, Lukather said: ""When Dave retired that was REAL hard for me 'cause we started the band together. Hell, it's 35 years if you count High School where the core all met. When Mike fell ill and had to leave that was it for me. If there isn't Paich or at least one Porcaro how can we even call it Toto?"" Luke also stated: ""Honestly, I have just had enough. This is NOT a break. It is over. I really can't go out and play Hold The Line with a straight face anymore."" The break-up of Toto after 31 years received mixed reactions from the fans, but in general the decision was understood and many agreed with Lukather's reasons to quit the band.

On April 5th, 2008, Toto played what would be their last show ever, in Seoul, Korea, as a part of their Falling In Between Live tour. This left lots of fans without a real farewell tour.

On February 26th, 2010, Steve Lukather announced on his Twitter-account that Toto are reforming for a brief tour in Europe in the summer of 2010 to honor bass player Mike Porcaro, who's suffering from ALS syndrome. Line-up will include David Paich, Steve Lukather, Steve Porcaro, Simon Phillips, Joseph Williams and Nathan East.

Miles Davis,"Miles Davis (Miles Dewey Davis III, Alton, Illinois, May 26, 1926 – Santa Monica, California, September 28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader and composer.

Widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Miles Davis was, with his musical groups, at the forefront of several major developments in jazz music, including bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz fusion. Many well-known musicians rose to prominence as members of Davis' ensembles, including saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, George Coleman, Wayne Shorter, Dave Liebman, Branford Marsalis and Kenny Garrett; trombonist J. J. Johnson; pianists Horace Silver, Red Garland, Wynton Kelly, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea, and Keith Jarrett; guitarists John McLaughlin, John Scofield and Mike Stern; bassists Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, Dave Holland, Marcus Miller and Darryl Jones, ; and drummers Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham, Jack DeJohnette, and Al Foster.

Miles Davis was born on May 26, 1926, to a relatively affluent family in Alton, Illinois. His father, Dr. Miles Henry Davis, was a dentist. In 1927 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They also owned a substantial ranch in northern Arkansas, where Davis learned to ride horses as a boy.

Davis' mother, Cleota Mae (Henry) Davis, wanted her son to learn the piano; she was a capable blues pianist but kept this fact hidden from her son. His musical studies began at 13, when his father gave him a trumpet and arranged lessons with local musician Elwood Buchanan. Davis later suggested that his father's instrument choice was made largely to irk his wife, who disliked the trumpet's sound. Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without vibrato; he was reported to have slapped Davis' knuckles every time he started using heavy vibrato. Davis would carry his clear signature tone throughout his career. He once remarked on its importance to him, saying, ""I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can’t get that sound I can’t play anything."" Clark Terry was another important early influence.

By age 16, Davis was a member of the music society and playing professionally when not at school. At 17, he spent a year playing in Eddie Randle's band, the Blue Devils. During this time, Sonny Stitt tried to persuade him to join the Tiny Bradshaw band, then passing through town, but Davis' mother insisted that he finish his final year of high school.

In 1944, the Billy Eckstine band visited East St. Louis. Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were members of the band, and Davis was brought in on third trumpet for a couple of weeks because the regular player, Buddy Anderson, was out sick. Even after this experience, once Eckstine's band left town, Davis' parents were still keen for him to continue formal academic studies.

In the fall of 1944, following graduation from high school, Davis moved to New York City to study at the Juilliard School of Music.

Upon arriving in New York, he spent most of his first weeks in town trying to get in contact with Charlie Parker, despite being advised against doing so by several people he met during his quest, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins.

Finally locating his idol, Davis became one of the cadre of musicians who held nightly jam sessions at two of Harlem's nightclubs, Minton's Playhouse and Monroe's. The group included many of the future leaders of the bebop revolution: young players such as Fats Navarro, Freddie Webster, and J. J. Johnson. Established musicians including Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke were also regular participants.

Davis dropped out of Juilliard, after asking permission from his father. In his autobiography, Davis criticized the Juilliard classes for centering too much on the classical European and ""white"" repertoire. However, he also acknowledged that Juilliard helped give him a grounding in music theory that would prove valuable in later years.

Davis began playing professionally, performing in several 52nd Street clubs with Coleman Hawkins and Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis. In 1945, he entered a recording studio for the first time, as a member of Herbie Fields's group. This was the first of many recordings to which Davis contributed in this period, mostly as a sideman. He finally got the chance to record as a leader in 1946, with an occasional group called the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway—one of the rare occasions when Davis, by then a member of the groundbreaking Charlie Parker Quintet, can be heard accompanying singers. In these early years, recording sessions where Davis was the leader were the exception rather than the rule; his next date as leader would not come until 1947.

Around 1945, Dizzy Gillespie parted ways with Parker, and Davis was hired as Gillespie's replacement in his quintet, which also featured Max Roach on drums, Al Haig (replaced later by Sir Charles Thompson and Duke Jordan) on piano, and Curley Russell (later replaced by Tommy Potter and Leonard Gaskin) on bass.

With Parker's quintet, Davis went into the studio several times, already showing hints of the style for which he would become known. On an oft-quoted take of Parker's signature song, ""Now's the Time"", Davis takes a melodic solo, whose unbop-like quality anticipates the ""cool jazz"" period that would follow. The Parker quintet also toured widely. During a stop in Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that landed him in the Camarillo State Mental Hospital for several months, and Davis found himself stranded. He roomed and collaborated for some time with bassist Charles Mingus, before getting a job on Billy Eckstine's California tour, which eventually brought him back to New York. In 1948, Parker returned to New York, and Davis rejoined his group.

The relationships within the quintet, however, were growing tense. Parker's erratic behavior (attributable to his well-known drug addiction) and artistic choices (both Davis and Roach objected to having Duke Jordan as a pianist and would have preferred Bud Powell) became sources of friction. In December 1948, disputes over money (Davis claims he was not being paid) began to strain their relationship even further. Davis finally left the group following a confrontation with Parker at the Royal Roost.

For Davis, his departure from Parker's group marked the beginning of a period in which he worked mainly as a freelancer and as a sideman in some of the most important combos on the New York jazz scene.

In 1948 Davis grew close to the Canadian composer and arranger Gil Evans. Evans' house had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers (including Davis, Roach, pianist John Lewis, and baritone sax player Gerry Mulligan) unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumentalism that dominated the bebop scene of the time. Evans had been the arranger for the Claude Thornhill orchestra, and it was the sound of this group, as well as Duke Ellington's example, that suggested the creation of an unusual line-up: a nonet including a French horn and a tuba (this accounts for the ""tuba band"" moniker that was to be associated with the combo).

Davis took an active role in the project, so much so that it soon became ""his project"". The objective was to achieve a sound similar to the human voice, through carefully arranged compositions and by emphasizing a relaxed, melodic approach to the improvisations.

The nonet debuted in the summer of 1948, with a two-week engagement at the Royal Roost. The sign announcing the performance gave a surprising prominence to the role of the arrangers: ""Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan"". It was, in fact, so unusual that Davis had to persuade the Roost's manager, Ralph Watkins, to allow the sign to be worded in this way; he prevailed only with the help of Monte Kay, the club's artistic director.

The nonet was active until the end of 1949, along the way undergoing several changes in personnel: Roach and Davis were constantly featured, along with Mulligan, tuba player Bill Barber, and alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, who had been preferred to Sonny Stitt (whose playing was considered too bop-oriented). Over the months, John Lewis alternated with Al Haig on piano, Mike Zwerin with Kai Winding on trombone (Johnson was touring at the time), Junior Collins with Sandy Siegelstein and Gunther Schuller on French horn, and Al McKibbon with Joe Shulman on bass. Singer Kenny Hagood was added for one track during the recording sessions.

The presence of white musicians in the group angered some African American jazz players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, but Davis rebuffed their criticisms.

A contract with Capitol Records granted the nonet several recording sessions between January 1949 and April 1950. The material they recorded was released in 1956 on an album whose title, Birth of the Cool, gave its name to the ""cool jazz"" movement that developed at the same time and partly shared the musical direction begun by Davis' group.

For his part, Davis was fully aware of the importance of the project, which he pursued to the point of turning down a job with Duke Ellington's orchestra.

The importance of the nonet experience would become clear to critics and the larger public only in later years, but, at least commercially, the nonet was not a success. The liner notes of the first recordings of the Davis Quintet for Columbia Records call it one of the most spectacular failures of the jazz club scene. This was bitterly noted by Davis, who claimed the invention of the cool style and resented the success that was later enjoyed—in large part because of the media's attention—by white ""cool jazz"" musicians (Mulligan and Dave Brubeck in particular).

This experience also marked the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Davis and Gil Evans, an alliance that would bear important results in the years to follow.

The first half of the 1950s was, for Davis, a period of great personal difficulty. At the end of 1949, he went on tour in Paris with a group including Tadd Dameron, Kenny Clarke (who remained in Europe after the tour), and James Moody. Davis was fascinated by Paris and its cultural environment, where black jazz musicians, and African Americans in general, often felt better respected than they did in their homeland. While in Paris, Davis began a relationship with French actress and singer Juliette Greco.

Many of his new and old friends (Davis, in his autobiography, mentions Clarke) tried to persuade him to stay in France, but Davis decided to return to New York. Back in the States, he began to feel deeply depressed. The depression was due in part to his separation from Greco, in part to his feeling underappreciated by the critics (who were hailing Davis' former collaborators as leaders of the cool jazz movement), and in part to the unraveling of his liaison with a former St. Louis schoolmate who was living with him in New York and with whom he had two children.

These are the factors to which Davis traces a heroin habit that deeply affected him for the next four years. Though Davis denies it in his autobiography, it is also likely that the environment in which he was living played a role. Most of Davis' associates at the time, some of them perhaps in imitation of Charlie Parker, had drug addictions of their own (among them, sax players Sonny Rollins and Dexter Gordon, trumpeters Fats Navarro and Freddie Webster, and drummer Art Blakey). For the next four years, Davis supported his habit partly with his music and partly by living the life of a hustler. By 1953, his drug addiction was beginning to impair his ability to perform. Heroin had killed some of his friends (Navarro and Freddie Webster). He himself had been arrested for drug possession while on tour in Los Angeles, and his drug habit had been made public in a devastating interview that Cab Calloway gave to Down Beat.

Realizing his precarious condition, Davis tried several times to end his drug addiction, finally succeeding in 1954 after returning to his father's home in St. Louis for several months and literally locking himself in a room until he had gone through a painful withdrawal. During this period he avoided New York and played mostly in Detroit and other midwestern towns, where drugs were then harder to come by.

Despite all the personal turmoil, the 1950–54 period was actually quite fruitful for Davis artistically. He made quite a number of recordings and had several collaborations with other important musicians. He got to know the music of Chicago pianist Ahmad Jamal, whose elegant approach and use of space influenced him deeply. He also definitively severed his stylistic ties with bebop.

In 1951, Davis met Bob Weinstock, the owner of Prestige Records, and signed a contract with the label. Between 1951 and 1954, he released many records on Prestige, with several different combos. While the personnel of the recordings varied, the lineup often featured Sonny Rollins and Art Blakey. Davis was particularly fond of Rollins and tried several times, in the years that preceded his meeting with John Coltrane, to recruit him for a regular group. He never succeeded, however, mostly because Rollins was prone to make himself unavailable for months at a time. In spite of the casual occasions that generated these recordings, their quality is almost always quite high, and they document the evolution of Davis' style and sound. During this time he began using the Harmon mute, held close to the microphone, in a way that grew to be his signature, and his phrasing, especially in ballads, became spacious, melodic, and relaxed. This sound was to become so characteristic that the use of the Harmon mute by any jazz trumpet player since immediately conjures up Miles Davis.

The most important Prestige recordings of this period (Dig, Blue Haze, Bags' Groove, Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants, and Walkin') originated mostly from recording sessions in 1951 and 1954, after Davis' recovery from his addiction. Also of importance are his five Blue Note recordings, collected in the Miles Davis, Volume 1 album.

With these recordings, Davis assumed a central position in what is known as hard bop. In contrast with bebop, hard bop used slower tempos and a less radical approach to harmony and melody, often adopting popular tunes and standards from the American songbook as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop also distanced itself from cool jazz by virtue of a harder beat and by its constant reference to the blues, both in its traditional form and in the form made popular by rhythm and blues. A few critics go as far as to call Walkin' the album that created hard bop, but the point is debatable, given the number of musicians who were working along similar lines at the same time (and of course many of them recorded or played with Davis).

Also in this period Davis gained a reputation for being distant, cold, and withdrawn and for having a quick temper. Among the several factors that contributed to this reputation were his contempt for the critics and specialized press and some well-publicized confrontations with the public and with fellow musicians. (One occasion, in which he had a near fight with Thelonious Monk during the recording of Bags' Groove, received wide exposure in the specialized press.)

The ""nocturnal"" quality of Davis' playing and his somber reputation, along with his whispering voice, earned him the lasting moniker of ""prince of darkness"", adding a patina of mystery to his public persona.

Back in New York and in better health, in 1955 Davis attended the Newport Jazz Festival, where his performance (and especially his solo on ""'Round Midnight"") was greatly admired and prompted the critics to hail the ""return of Miles Davis"". At the same time, Davis recruited the players for a formation that became known as his ""first great quintet"": John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums.

None of these musicians, with the exception of Davis, had received a great deal of exposure before that time; Chambers, in particular, was very young (19 at the time), a Detroit player who had been on the New York scene for only about a year, working with the bands of Bennie Green, Paul Quinichette, George Wallington, J. J. Johnson, and Kai Winding. Coltrane was little known at the time, in spite of earlier collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, and Johnny Hodges. Davis hired Coltrane as a replacement for Sonny Rollins, after unsuccessfully trying to recruit Cannonball Adderley.

The repertoire included many bebop mainstays, standards from the Great American Songbook and the pre-bop era, and some traditional tunes. The prevailing style of the group was a development of the Davis experience in the previous years—Davis playing long, legato, and essentially melodic lines, while Coltrane, who during these years emerged as a leading figure on the musical scene, contrasted by playing high-energy solos.

With the new formation also came a new recording contract. In Newport, Davis had met Columbia Records producer George Avakian, who persuaded him to sign with his label. The quintet made its debut on record with the extremely well received 'Round About Midnight. Before leaving Prestige, however, Davis had to fulfill his obligations during two days of recording sessions in 1956. Prestige released these recordings in the following years as four albums: Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, and Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet. While the recording took place in a studio, each record of this series has the structure and feel of a live performance, with several first takes on each album. The records became almost instant classics and were instrumental in establishing Davis' quintet as one of the best on the jazz scene.

The quintet was disbanded for the first time in 1957, following a series of personal problems that Davis blames on the drug addiction of the other musicians. Davis played some gigs at the Cafe Bohemia with a short-lived formation that included Sonny Rollins and drummer Art Taylor, and then traveled to France, where he recorded the score to Louis Malle's film Ascenseur pour l'échafaud. With the aid of French session musicians Barney Wilen, Pierre Michelot, and René Urtreger, and American drummer Kenny Clarke, he recorded the entire soundtrack with an innovative procedure, without relying on written material: starting from sparse indication of the harmony and a general feel of a given piece, the group played by watching the movie on a screen in front of them and improvising.

Returning to New York in 1958, Davis recruited alto saxophonist Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley. Coltrane, who in the meantime had freed himself from his drug habits, was available after a highly fruitful experience with Thelonious Monk and was hired back, as was Philly Joe Jones. With the quintet re-formed as a sextet, Davis recorded Milestones, an album anticipating the new directions he was preparing to give to his music.

Almost immediately after the recording of Milestones, Davis fired Garland and, shortly afterward, Jones, again for behavioral problems; he replaced them with Bill Evans—a young white pianist with a strong classical background—and drummer Jimmy Cobb. With this revamped formation, Davis began a year during which the sextet performed and toured extensively and produced a record (1958 Miles, also known as 58 Sessions). Evans had a unique, impressionistic approach to the piano, and his musical ideas had a strong influence on Davis. But after only eight months on the road with the group, he was burned out and left. He was soon replaced by Wynton Kelly, a player who brought to the sextet a swinging, bluesy approach that contrasted with Evans' more delicate playing.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Davis recorded a series of albums with Gil Evans, often playing flugelhorn as well as trumpet. The first, Miles Ahead (1957), showcased his playing with a jazz big band and a horn section arranged by Evans. Songs included Dave Brubeck's ""The Duke,"" as well as Léo Delibes's ""The Maids of Cadiz,"" the first piece of European classical music Davis had recorded. Another distinctive feature of the album was the orchestral passages that Evans had devised as transitions between the different tracks, which were joined together with the innovative use of editing in the post-production phase, turning each side of the album into a seamless piece of music.

In 1958, Davis and Evans were back in the studio to record Porgy and Bess, an arrangement of pieces from George Gershwin's opera of the same name. The lineup included three members of the sextet: Paul Chambers, Philly Joe Jones, and Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley. Davis called the album one of his favorites.

Sketches of Spain (1959–1960) featured songs by contemporary Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo and also Manuel de Falla, as well as Gil Evans originals with a Spanish flavor. Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall (1961) includes Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez, along with other compositions recorded in concert with an orchestra under Evans' direction.

Sessions with Davis and Evans in 1962 resulted in the album Quiet Nights, a short collection of bossa novas that was released against the wishes of both artists: Evans stated it was only half an album, and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer Teo Macero, whom he didn't speak to for more than two years. This was the last time Evans and Davis made a full album together; despite the professional separation, however, Davis noted later that ""my best friend is Gil Evans.""

In March and April 1959, Davis re-entered the studio with his working sextet to record what is widely considered his magnum opus, Kind of Blue. He called back Bill Evans, months away from forming what would become his own seminal trio, for the album sessions, as the music had been planned around Evans' piano style. Both Davis and Evans were personally acquainted with the ideas of pianist George Russell regarding modal jazz, Davis from discussions with Russell and others before the Birth of the Cool sessions, and Evans from study with Russell in 1956. Davis, however, had neglected to inform current pianist Kelly of Evans' role in the recordings; Kelly subsequently played only on the track ""Freddie Freeloader"" and was not present at the April dates for the album. ""So What"" and ""All Blues"" had been played by the sextet at performances prior to the recording sessions, but for the other three compositions, Davis and Evans prepared skeletal harmonic frameworks that the other musicians saw for the first time on the day of recording, to allow a fresher approach to their improvisations. The resulting album has proven to be both highly popular and enormously influential. According to the RIAA, Kind of Blue is the best-selling jazz album of all time, having been certified as quadruple platinum (4 million copies sold). In December 2009, the US House of Representatives voted 409–0 to pass a resolution honoring the album as a national treasure.

The trumpet Davis used on the recording is currently displayed in the music building on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. It was donated to the school by Arthur ""Buddy"" Gist, who met Davis in 1949 and became a close friend. The gift was the reason why the jazz program at UNCG is named the ""Miles Davis Jazz Studies Program.""

Later in 1959, while taking a break outside the famous Birdland nightclub in New York City, Davis along with others were told by a police officer to clear the side walk and subsequently didn't. The officer said that he would arrest Miles and reached for his cuffs when Miles leaned toward him (boxing style), the police officer fell backward with his cuffs falling. Seconds later a detective came up behind Miles and hit him on the head with a baton resulting in blood getting on his suit. Miles was then arrested, where in the station police harassed him by bumping into him on purpose. Davis attempted to pursue the case in the courts, before eventually dropping the proceedings in a plea bargain in order to recover his suspended Cabaret Card, enabling him to return to work in New York clubs.

Davis persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. Coltrane then departed to form his classic quartet, although he returned for some of the tracks on Davis' 1961 album Someday My Prince Will Come. After Coltrane, Davis tried various saxophonists, including Jimmy Heath, Sonny Stitt, and Hank Mobley. The quintet with Hank Mobley was recorded in the studio and on several live engagements at Carnegie Hall and the Black Hawk jazz club in San Francisco. Stitt's playing with the group is found on a recording made in Olympia, Paris (where Davis and Coltrane had played a few months before) and the Live in Stockholm album.

In 1963, Davis' longtime rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb departed. He quickly got to work putting together a new group, including tenor saxophonist George Coleman and bassist Ron Carter. Davis, Coleman, Carter and a few other musicians recorded half the tracks for an album in the spring of 1963. A few weeks later, seventeen-year-old drummer Tony Williams and pianist Herbie Hancock joined the group, and soon afterward Davis, Coleman, and the new rhythm section recorded the rest of Seven Steps to Heaven.

The rhythm players melded together quickly as a section and with the horns. The group's rapid evolution can be traced through the Seven Steps to Heaven album, In Europe (July 1963), My Funny Valentine (February 1964), and Four and More (also February 1964). The quintet played essentially the same repertoire of bebop tunes and standards that earlier Davis bands had played, but they tackled them with increasing structural and rhythmic freedom and, in the case of the up-tempo material, breakneck speed.

Coleman left in the spring of 1964, to be replaced by avant-garde saxophonist Sam Rivers, on the suggestion of Tony Williams. Rivers remained in the group only briefly, but was recorded live with the quintet in Japan; this configuration can be heard on Miles in Tokyo! (July 1964).

By the end of the summer, Davis had persuaded Wayne Shorter to leave Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and join the quintet. Shorter became the group's principal composer, and some of his compositions of this era (including ""Footprints"" and ""Nefertiti"") have become standards. While on tour in Europe, the group quickly made their first official recording, Miles in Berlin (September 1964). On returning to the United States later that year, ever the musical entrepreneur, Davis (at Jackie DeShannon's urging) was instrumental in getting The Byrds signed to Columbia Records.

By the time of E.S.P. (1965), Davis' lineup consisted of Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter (bass), and Tony Williams (drums). The last of his acoustic bands, this group is often referred to as ""the second great quintet.""

A two-night Chicago performance in late 1965 is captured on The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965, released in 1995. Unlike their studio albums, the live engagement shows the group still playing primarily standards and bebop tunes. It is reasonable to point out though, that whilst some of the titles remain the same as the tunes employed by the 1950s quintet, the speed and distance of departure from the framework of the standards bears no comparison. It could even be said that the listening experience to these standards as live performances is as much of a radical take on the jazz of the time as the new compositions of the studio albums listed below.

The recording of Live at the Plugged Nickel was not issued anywhere in the 1960s, first appearing as a Japan-only partial issue in the late 1970s, then as a double-LP in the USA and Europe in 1982. It was followed by a series of studio recordings: Miles Smiles (1966), Sorcerer (1967), Nefertiti (1967), Miles in the Sky (1968), and Filles de Kilimanjaro (1968). The quintet's approach to improvisation came to be known as ""time no changes"" or ""freebop,"" because they abandoned the more conventional chord-change-based approach of bebop for a modal approach. Through Nefertiti, the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their live concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of demarcation. Davis's bands would continue to perform in this way until his retirement in 1975.

Miles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro, on which electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar were tentatively introduced on some tracks, pointed the way to the subsequent fusion phase of Davis' career. Davis also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of Filles de Kilimanjaro had been recorded, bassist Dave Holland and pianist Chick Corea had replaced Carter and Hancock in the working band, though both Carter and Hancock would occasionally contribute to future recording sessions. Davis soon began to take over the compositional duties of his sidemen.

Davis' influences included late-1960s acid rock and funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone, James Brown, and Jimi Hendrix, many of whom he met through Betty Mabry (later Betty Davis), a young model and songwriter Davis married in September 1968 and divorced a year later. The musical transition required that Davis and his band adapt to electric instruments in both live performances and the studio.

By the time In a Silent Way had been recorded in February 1969, Davis had augmented his quintet with additional players. At various times Hancock or Joe Zawinul was brought in to join Corea on electric keyboards, and guitarist John McLaughlin made the first of his many appearances with Davis. By this point, Shorter was also doubling on soprano saxophone. After recording this album, Williams left to form his group Lifetime and was replaced by Jack DeJohnette.

Six months later an even larger group of musicians, including Jack DeJohnette, Airto Moreira, and Bennie Maupin, recorded the double LP Bitches Brew, which became a huge seller, reaching gold status by 1976. This album and In a Silent Way were among the first fusions of jazz and rock that were commercially successful, building on the groundwork laid by Charles Lloyd, Larry Coryell, and others who pioneered a genre that would become known as ""jazz-rock fusion"".

During this period, Davis toured with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette. The group's repertoire included material from Bitches Brew, In a Silent Way, and the 1960s quintet albums, along with an occasional standard.

In 1972, Davis was introduced to the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen by Paul Buckmaster, leading to a period of new creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote that ""the effect of Davis' study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long. . . . Davis' own 'space music' shows Stockhausen's influence compositionally."" His recordings and performances during this period were described as ""space music"" by fans, by music critic Leonard Feather, and by Buckmaster, who described it as ""a lot of mood changes—heavy, dark, intense—definitely space music.""

Both Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way feature ""extended"" (more than 20 minutes each) compositions that were never actually ""played straight through"" by the musicians in the studio. Instead, Davis and producer Teo Macero selected musical motifs of various lengths from recorded extended improvisations and edited them together into a musical whole that exists only in the recorded version. Bitches Brew made use of such electronic effects as multi-tracking, tape loops, and other editing techniques. Both records, especially Bitches Brew, proved to be big sellers.

Starting with Bitches Brew, Davis' albums began to often feature cover art much more in line with psychedelic art or black power movements than that of his earlier albums. He took significant cuts in his usual performing fees in order to open for rock groups like the Steve Miller Band, the Grateful Dead, and Santana. Several live albums were recorded during the early 1970s at these performances: Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970) - It's About That Time, Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West, and Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East.

By the time of Live-Evil in December 1970, Davis' ensemble had transformed into a much more funk-oriented group. Davis began experimenting with wah-wah effects on his horn. The ensemble with Gary Bartz, Keith Jarrett, and Michael Henderson, often referred to as the ""Cellar Door band"" (the live portions of Live-Evil were recorded at a Washington, DC, club by that name), never recorded in the studio, but is documented in the six-CD box set The Cellar Door Sessions 1970, which was recorded over four nights in December 1970.

In 1970, Davis contributed extensively to the soundtrack of a documentary about the African-American boxer heavyweight champion Jack Johnson. Himself a devotee of boxing, Davis drew parallels between Johnson, whose career had been defined by the fruitless search for a Great White Hope to dethrone him, and Davis' own career, in which he felt the musical establishment of the time had prevented him from receiving the acclaim and rewards that were due him. The resulting album, 1971's A Tribute to Jack Johnson, contained two long pieces that featured musicians (some of whom were not credited on the record) including guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, Herbie Hancock on a Farfisa organ, and drummer Billy Cobham. McLaughlin and Cobham went on to become founding members of the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1971.

As Davis stated in his autobiography, he wanted to make music for the young African-American audience. On the Corner (1972) blended funk elements with the traditional jazz styles he had played his entire career. The album was highlighted by the appearance of saxophonist Carlos Garnett. Critics were not kind to the album; in his autobiography, Davis stated that critics could not figure out how to categorize it, and he complained that the album was not promoted by the ""traditional"" jazz radio stations.

After recording On the Corner, Davis put together a new group, with only Michael Henderson, Carlos Garnett, and percussionist Mtume returning from the previous band. It included guitarist Reggie Lucas, tabla player Badal Roy, sitarist Khalil Balakrishna, and drummer Al Foster. It was unusual in that none of the sidemen were major jazz instrumentalists; as a result, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of individual solos. This group, which recorded in the Philharmonic Hall for the album In Concert: Live at Philharmonic Hall (1972), was unsatisfactory to Davis. Through the first half of 1973, he dropped the tabla and sitar, took over keyboard duties, and added guitarist Pete Cosey. The Davis/Cosey/Lucas/Henderson/Mtume/Foster ensemble would remain virtually intact over the next two years. Initially, Dave Liebman played saxophones and flute with the band; in 1974, he was replaced by Sonny Fortune.

Big Fun (1974) was a double album containing four long improvisations, recorded between 1969 and 1972. Similarly, Get Up With It (1974) collected recordings from the previous five years. Get Up With It included ""He Loved Him Madly"", a tribute to Duke Ellington, as well as one of Davis' most lauded pieces from this era, ""Calypso Frelimo"". It was his last studio album of the 1970s.

In 1974 and 1975, Columbia recorded three double-LP live Davis albums: Dark Magus, Agharta, and Pangaea. Dark Magus captures a 1974 New York concert; the latter two are recordings of consecutive concerts from the same February 1975 day in Osaka. At the time, only Agharta was available in the US; Pangaea and Dark Magus were initially released only by CBS/Sony Japan. All three feature at least two electric guitarists (Reggie Lucas and Pete Cosey, deploying an array of Hendrix-inspired electronic distortion devices; Dominique Gaumont is a third guitarist on Dark Magus), electric bass, drums, reeds, and Davis on electric trumpet and organ. These albums were the last he was to record for five years. Davis was troubled by osteoarthritis (which led to a hip replacement operation in 1976, the first of several), sickle-cell anemia, depression, bursitis, ulcers, and a renewed dependence on alcohol and drugs (primarily cocaine), and his performances were routinely panned by critics throughout late 1974 and early 1975. By the time the group reached Japan in February 1975, Davis was nearing a physical breakdown and required copious amounts of alcohol and narcotics to make it through his engagements. Nonetheless, as noted by Richard Cook and Brian Morton, during these concerts his trumpet playing ""is of the highest and most adventurous order.""

After a Newport Jazz Festival performance at Avery Fisher Hall in New York on July 1, 1975, Davis withdrew almost completely from the public eye for six years. As Gil Evans said, ""His organism is tired. And after all the music he's contributed for 35 years, he needs a rest.""

Davis characterized this period in his memoirs as a colorful time when wealthy women lavished him with sex and drugs. In reality, he had become completely dependent on various drugs, spending nearly all of his time propped up on a couch in his apartment watching television, leaving only to find more drugs. In 1976, Rolling Stone reported rumors of his imminent demise. Although he stopped practicing trumpet on a regular basis, Davis continued to compose intermittently and made three attempts at recording during his exile from performing; these sessions (one with the assistance of Paul Buckmaster and Gil Evans, who left after not receiving promised compensation) bore little fruit and remain unreleased.

In 1979, he placed in the yearly top-ten trumpeter poll of Down Beat. Columbia continued to issue compilation albums and records of unreleased vault material to fulfill contractual obligations.

During his period of inactivity, Davis saw the fusion music that he had spearheaded over the past decade enter into the mainstream. When he emerged from retirement, Davis' musical descendants would be in the realm of New Wave rock, and in particular the styling of Prince.

By 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress Cicely Tyson. With Tyson, Davis would overcome his cocaine addiction and regain his enthusiasm for music. As he had not played trumpet for the better part of three years, regaining his famed embouchure proved to be particularly arduous. While recording The Man with the Horn (sessions were spread sporadically over 1979–1981), Davis played mostly wahwah with a younger, larger band.

The initial large band was eventually abandoned in favor of a smaller combo featuring saxophonist Bill Evans and bass player Marcus Miller, both of whom would be among Davis' most regular collaborators throughout the decade. He married Tyson in 1981; they would divorce in 1988. The Man with the Horn was finally released in 1981 and received a poor critical reception despite selling fairly well. In May, the new band played two dates as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. The concerts, as well as the live recording We Want Miles from the ensuing tour, received positive reviews.

By late 1982, Davis' band included French percussionist Mino Cinelu and guitarist John Scofield, with whom he worked closely on the album Star People. In mid-1983, while working on the tracks for Decoy, an album mixing soul music and electronica that was released in 1984, Davis brought in producer, composer and keyboardist Robert Irving III, who had earlier collaborated with him on The Man with the Horn. With a seven-piece band, including Scofield, Evans, keyboardist and music director Irving, drummer Al Foster and bassist Darryl Jones (later of The Rolling Stones), Davis played a series of European gigs to positive receptions. While in Europe, he took part in the recording of Aura, an orchestral tribute to Davis composed by Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg. You're Under Arrest, Davis' next album, was released in 1985 and included another brief stylistic detour. Included on the album were his interpretations of Cyndi Lauper's ballad ""Time After Time,"" and ""Human Nature"" from Michael Jackson. Davis considered releasing an entire album of pop songs and recorded dozens of them, but the idea was scrapped. Davis noted that many of today's accepted jazz standards were in fact pop songs from Broadway theater, and that he was simply updating the ""standards"" repertoire with new material.

You're Under Arrest also proved to be Davis' final album for Columbia. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis publicly dismissed Davis' more recent fusion recordings as not being ""'true' jazz"", comments Davis initially shrugged off, calling Marsalis ""a nice young man, only confused"". This changed after Marsalis appeared, unannounced, onstage in the midst of a Davis performance. Marsalis whispered into Davis' ear that ""someone"" had told him to do so; Davis responded by ordering him off the stage.

Davis grew irritated at Columbia's delay releasing Aura. The breaking point in the label-artist relationship appears to have come when a Columbia jazz producer requested Davis place a goodwill birthday call to Marsalis. Davis signed with Warner Brothers shortly thereafter.

Davis collaborated with a number of figures from the British new wave movement during this period, including Scritti Politti. At the invitation of producer Bill Laswell, Davis recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for Public Image Ltd's Album, according to Public Image's John Lydon in the liner notes of their Plastic Box box set. In Lydon's words, however, ""strangely enough, we didn't use (his contributions)."" (Also according to Lydon in the Plastic Box notes, Davis favorably compared Lydon's singing voice to his trumpet sound.)

Having first taken part in the Artists United Against Apartheid recording, Davis signed with Warner Brothers records and reunited with Marcus Miller. The resulting record, Tutu (1986), would be his first to use modern studio tools — programmed synthesizers, samples and drum loops — to create an entirely new setting for Davis' playing. Ecstatically reviewed on its release, the album would frequently be described as the modern counterpart of Sketches of Spain and won a Grammy in 1987.

He followed Tutu with Amandla, another collaboration with Miller and George Duke, plus the soundtracks to four movies: Street Smart, Siesta, The Hot Spot, and Dingo. He continued to tour with a band of constantly rotating personnel and a critical stock at a level higher than it had been for 15 years. His last recordings, both released posthumously, were the hip hop-influenced studio album Doo-Bop and Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux, a collaboration with Quincy Jones for the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival in which Davis performed the repertoire from his 1940s and 1950s recordings for the first time in decades.

In 1988 he had a small part as a street musician in the film Scrooged, starring Bill Murray. He received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. In 1989, Miles was interviewed on the television show '60 minutes' by Harry Reasoner.

In early 1991, he appeared in the Rolf de Heer film Dingo as a jazz musician. In the film's opening sequence, Davis and his band unexpectedly land on a remote airstrip in the Australian outback and proceed to perform for the stunned locals. The performance was one of Davis' last on film.

Miles Davis died on September 28, 1991 from a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure in Santa Monica, California at the age of 65. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.

Miles Davis is regarded as one of the most innovative, influential and respected figures in the history of jazz music. He has been described as “one of the great innovators in jazz”. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll noted ""Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-'40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style - in attitude and fashion - as well as music"". His album Kind of Blue is the best-selling album in the history of jazz music and was praised by the United States House of Representatives to ""pass a symbolic resolution honoring the masterpiece and reaffirming jazz as a national treasure.""

As an innovative bandleader and composer, Miles Davis has influenced many notable musicians and bands from diverse genres. These include Wayne Shorter, Cannonball Adderley, Herbie Hancock, Lalo Schifrin, Tangerine Dream, Brand X, Mtume, Benny Bailey, Joe Bonner, Don Cherry, Urszula Dudziak, Bill Evans, Bill Hardman, The Lounge Lizards, Hugh Masekela , John McLaughlin, King Crimson, Steely Dan, Frank Zappa, Radiohead, The Flaming Lips, Lydia Lunch, Talk Talk, Michael Franks, Sting, Lonnie Liston Smith, Jiří Stivín, Tim Hagans, Julie Christensen, Vassar Clements, Snooky Young, Prince and Christian Scott.

Miles' influence on the people who played with him has been described by music writer and author Christopher Smith as follows:

Miles Davis' artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary. [...] Miles' performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.

His approach, owing largely to the African American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians.

In 1986, the New England Conservatory awarded Miles Davis an Honorary Doctorate for his extraordinary contributions to music. Since 1960 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) has honored him with eight Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Taylor Swift,"Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989 in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania) is an American country pop singer-songwriter and actress. Swift is a 8-time Grammy winner with a total of 23 nominations (Feb 2016).

In 2006, she released her debut single ""Tim McGraw"", then her self-titled debut album, which was subsequently certified multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

In November 2008, Swift released her second album, Fearless, which featured a number of more pop oriented songs such as ""You Belong With Me"" and ""Love Story"". Fearless was the best-selling album in 2009 in the USA and was awarded with 4 Grammy's.

Swift's third and fourth albums, 2010's ""Speak Now"" and 2012's ""Red"", both sold over one million copies within the first week of their US release. “Speak Now” won two Grammy Awards, while “Red’s” singles "" We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together "" and "" I Knew You Were Trouble"" were worldwide hits.

The 1989 was released on October 27, 2014. It marked a move away from her earlier country sounds and fully into pop. Both the title (""1989"") and the overall sound of the album - synth pop - were a nod to her birth year and nostalgia with the 1980s. It became the best-selling album of 2014, selling 3.66m copies in USA, and as of April 2015, it had sold 4.5m copies in the US (9m worldwide).  The first single from the album was ""Shake It Off"" (released on August 18, 2014), which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

On February 15, 2016, Taylor Swift won ""album of the year"" at the 58th Grammy Awards for ""1989"".

Alice in Chains,"Alice in Chains is a hard rock band that was formed in 1987 in  Seattle, Washington, United States. Drawing equally from the heavy riffing of metal and the gloomy strains of what would become grunge, the band developed a bleak, nihilistic sound that balanced grinding riffs with subtly textured acoustic moments. They were hard enough for metal fans, but their dark subject matter and punk-fueled attack placed them among the front ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands. This dichotomy helped the group soar to critical acclaim and multi-platinum status with their first albums, 1990's 'Facelift' and 1992's 'Dirt', yet it also divided them. Guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter Jerry Cantrell always leaned toward the mainstream, while singer-songwriter Layne Staley felt fascinated with the seamy underground lyrically and musically. Such tension drove the band toward stardom in their early years. Following 'Dirt', however, Alice in Chains suffered from near-crippling internal tensions that kept the band off the road for the remainder of the 90s, and personal tragedy soon would strike. 

The idea for the group arose from the band members' mutual interest in dark, powerful heavy metal and energetic rock music. Formed in 1987 by Staley, guitarist Jerry Cantrell, bassist Mike Starr, and drummer Sean Kinney, the outfit was first named “Alice N’ Chains” and featured a different image in terms of clothes and stage performances, although they still had a tough edge to their music. The guys later changed it to ""Alice in Chains"" as things came together.  Combining the unique voice and intense delivery of Staley with the evocative songwriting and vocal harmonies of Cantrell, Alice in Chains created an immediately identifiable sound that also proved to be quite versatile as their repertoire grew to include both driving, angry rock songs and mellow acoustic compositions.

The unique vocal harmonies of Staley and Cantrell included at times overlapping passages and dual lead vocals. Alyssa Burrows has said the band's distinctive sound ""came from Staley's vocal style and his lyrics dealing with personal struggles and addiction"". Staley's songs were often considered ""black"" or ""dark"" as stated before, with themes such as drug abuse, depression, and suicide displayed, while Cantrell's lyrics dealt more with personal relationships. Both of them expressed a desire to convey a sense of reality and a powerful 'in-the-moment' feel in the band's music, with a big emphasis on strong guitar riffs.

Although Alice in Chains has attracted many genre labels over the years, Cantrell identifies his band as primarily metal with diverse influences blended in. He told the magazine 'Guitar World' in 1996: ""We're a lot of different things... I don't quite know what the mixture is, but there's definitely metal, blues, rock and roll, maybe a touch of punk. The metal part will never leave, and I never want it to"". Alice in Chains has cited musical influences such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Metallica as setting the path for their sound.

Cantrell's guitar style combines what Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic has called ""pummeling riffs and expansive guitar textures"" to create ""slow, brooding minor-key grinds"". While down-tuned, distorted guitars mixed with Staley's distinctive ""snarl-to-a-scream"" vocals appealed to many heavy metal and punk rock fans, the band also had ""a sense of melody that was undeniable"" in numerous songs, conveying the rebellious yet tuneful spirit of traditional ""rock and roll"" as Cantrell had remarked. Thus, Alice in Chains broke through to a mainstream audience outside of the metal underground in a big way in the 90s and onward, even though many other groups with perhaps less talented songwriting struggled.

The band found artistic and commercial success not long after their formation, but things really shifted into high gear through the release of 1992's 'Dirt', which displayed highly skilled work while also highlighting Staley’s increasingly apparent addiction to heroin. The band appeared on the successful Lollapalooza tour in 1993 and released the 'Jar of Flies' EP in 1994. However, the guys often found their attempts to follow up past successes in the studio or on the road hampered by Staley’s erratic, drug-fueled behavior. That artist's compelling talents appeared matched by his strong personal demons. Former Ozzy Osbourne bassist Mike Inez came in to replace Starr, and the band would eventually record a third studio LP as well as undergo a famous performance on the 'MTV Unplugged' program that many would remember in rock history. 

Ultimately, however, Alice in Chains would fail to maintain a consistent career in the post-grunge music world. The time around the turn of the millennium represented a shifting moment musically, with various genres outside of dark-sounding hard rock and metal getting spotlights in the mainstream. The band limped into hiatus when Cantrell turned his attention to solo projects, which garnered some critical praise and often included contributions from Kinney and Inez. Yet his personal work never received the same attention as that of Alice in Chains, the group's first two albums reliably selling well for years and years. Sadly, Staley finally succumbed to his afflictions when he overdosed in April 2002.

Although Alice in Chains never officially disbanded, Staley had become a recluse as the years had dragged on, rarely leaving his Seattle condominium following the death of his fiancée in 1996 (due to bacterial endocarditis). ""Drugs worked for me for years"", Staley told the magazine 'Rolling Stone' in 1996, ""and now they're turning against me, now I'm walking through hell"". In 1998, Staley briefly reunited with Alice in Chains to record two new songs, which were titled ""Get Born Again"" and ""Died"". Originally written for a Cantrell solo album, the songs were released in the fall of 1999 as a part of a box set called 'Music Bank'. The set contains a full 48 songs, including rarities, demos, and previous album tracks. The band also released a 15-track compilation titled 'Nothing Safe: Best of the Box', serving as a sampler for 'Music Bank'. The group's first greatest hits compilation also appeared. Another official release of note is a live album, simply titled 'Live', which was released on December 5, 2000.

Staley, found dead in his condominium on April 19, 2002, would be subject to an autopsy that revealed that he had died from a mixture of heroin and cocaine fourteen days previously. In his last interview, which was given months before his death, Staley admitted, ""I know I'm near death, I did crack and heroin for years. I never wanted to end my life this way."" Cantrell, shaken by the death of his friend and former band-mate, dedicated his 2002 solo album, titled 'Degradation Trip', to Staley's memory.

Jerry Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney reformed and played shows in late 2005 and early 2006 with a variety of guest vocalists, including  Billy Corgan, Pat Lachman, Wes Scantlin, Maynard James Keenan, Ann Wilson and Phil Anselmo. For their European and U.S. tours of mid-late 2006, William Duvall (Comes With The Fall) performed lead vocals.

Vocalist for Comes With the Fall, William DuVall, joined Alice in Chains as lead singer during the band's reunion concerts. Velvet Revolver and ex-Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan also joined the band for the reunion tour, playing rhythm guitar on selected songs. Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains. However, AliceinChains.com reported that the band has begun writing new material, with DuVall on lead vocals. In September 2009 the band released their first studio album since 1995. The album is called 'Black Gives Way to Blue' and is a surprisingly good album and is received worldwide with good critisism. During the last months of 2009 they tour Europe and almost everywhere the shows are sold out. 

Alice in Chains has sold more than twenty million albums in the United States (and an estimated 40 million worldwide), released two number-one albums and 19 top 40 singles, and has received six Grammy nominations. The band was ranked number 34 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. Alice in Chains has had a large impact on many bands, such as Godsmack, who, according to Jon Wiederhorn of MTV, ""have sonically followed Alice in Chains' lead while adding their own distinctive edge"". Godsmack singer Sully Erna has also cited Layne Staley as his primary influence. Staind has covered Alice in Chains' song ""Nutshell"" live, which appears on the compilation The Singles: 1996-2006, and also wrote a song entitled ""Layne"", in Staley's dedication, on the album 14 Shades of Grey. Other bands that have been inspired by Alice in Chains include Taproot, Puddle of Mudd, Smile Empty Soul, Creed, Nickelback, Cold and Tantric. Metallica, who originally influenced Alice in Chains, in turn said they always wanted to tour with the band, citing Alice in Chains as a major influence on the vocal melodies for Metallica's eighth studio album St. Anger.

Dr. Dre,"André Romelle Young (born February 18, 1965 in Los Angeles, California), better known by his stage name Dr. Dre, is an American record producer, rapper, actor and record executive. He is the founder and current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and a former co-owner and artist of Death Row Records, also having produced albums for and overseeing the careers of many rappers signed to those record labels. As a producer he is credited as a key figure in the popularization of West Coast G-funk, a style of rap music characterized as synthesizer-based with slow, bass heavy beats. 
Dr. Dre began his career in music as a member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru and he later found fame with the influential gangsta rap group N.W.A, which popularized the use of explicit lyrics in rap to detail the violence of street life. His 1992 solo debut The Chronic, released under Death Row Records, led him to become one of the best-selling American performing artists of 1993. In 1996 he left Death Row to found his own label Aftermath Entertainment, producing a compilation album, Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, in 1997 and releasing a solo album titled 2001 in 1999.

During the 2000s he focused his career on production for other artists, while occasionally contributing vocals in other artists' songs. Rolling Stone named him among the highest-paid performers of 2001 and 2004. Dr. Dre also had acting roles in the 2001 films The Wash and Training Day. In 2011, his final solo studio album, Detox, is set to be released following much delay and speculation.

Early life

The first child of Verna and Theodore Young, Dr. Dre was born as André Romelle Young on February 18, 1965. His mother was only 16 years old at the time of his birth, after being impregnated by teenage boyfriend Theodore, whom she later married. Young's middle name, ""Romelle"", came from Theodore Young's unsigned, amateur R&B singing group The Romells. In 1968 his mother divorced Theodore Young for another man, Curtis Crayon, and had other children with him, including two sons named Jerome and Tyree (both of whom are now deceased)[8][9] and daughter Shameka.[10] As a young child, Young was fascinated with vinyl records spinning on phonographs; his family's record collection included many popular R&B albums of the 1960s and 1970s, from such singers as Diana Ross, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin. According to an interview with the Los Angeles Times, his mother Verna found R&B music to be a relief from the two jobs she had to work daily.[11] Despite economic troubles, she continued to encourage Young not to give up in life. During Verna's second marriage, Young and his step-brother Tyree were raised primarily by their grandmother and Curtis Crayon, as their mother spent much time in search of work.[12]

In 1976 Young began attending Vanguard Junior High School and had a new sister named Shameka. However, due to gang violence around Vanguard, he transferred to nearby Roosevelt Junior High School.[13] Verna later married Warren Griffin, whom she met at her new job in Long Beach,[14] which added three new stepsisters and one new stepbrother to the family. The stepbrother, Warren Griffin III, would eventually become a rapper under the stage name Warren G.[15]

Young attended Centennial High School in Compton during his freshman year in 1979 but transferred to Fremont High School due to poor grades. On December 15, 1981, Young fathered a son with Lisa Johnson, however Curtis Young was not brought up by his father and they only met when Curtis had become rapper Hood Surgeon about 20 years later.[16] He was nearly enrolled to an apprenticeship program at Northrop Aviation Company until poor grades at school made him ineligible. Therefore, he focused on social life and entertainment for most of his high school years.[17]

Music career

World Class Wreckin' Cru (1984–1985)

    Main article: World Class Wreckin' Cru

Inspired by the Grandmaster Flash song ""The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel"", he often attended a club called The Eve After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live. Thus, he became a DJ in the club, initially under the name ""Dr. J"" based on the nickname for Julius Erving, his favorite basketball player. At the club, he met aspiring rapper Antoine Carraby, later to become member DJ Yella of his group N.W.A.[18] Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr. Dre, a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name, referring to himself as the ""Master of Mixology"".[19] He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin' Cru under the independent Kru-Cut Records in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early 1980s West Coast hip hop, and their first hit ""Surgery"" would prominently feature Dr. Dre on the turntables and sell 50,000 copies within the Compton area.[20] Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station KDAY, boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show The Traffic Jam.[21]

Due to the amount of time Dr. Dre was spending on his rap music he frequently skipped school, affecting his education. His absences also jeopardized his position as a diver for his school's swim team. However, when he did attend he received good grades in certain classes. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother's demands for him to get a job or go to school. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother's house.[22] He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.[23]

N.W.A and Ruthless Records (1986–1991)

In 1986 he met rapper Ice Cube, who collaborated with Dr. Dre to record songs for Ruthless Records, a rap record label run by local rapper and drug dealer Eazy-E. N.W.A however, along with fellow west coast rapper Ice T, debuted with rhymes including profanity and gritty depictions of crime and life on the street. No longer constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as Public Enemy or Boogie Down Productions, N.W.A shot out with hardcore and realistic perspective of street violence and local black gangster lifestyle. Propelled by the hit ""Fuck tha Police"", the group's first full album Straight Outta Compton became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours and warnings from the FBI.[2] The FBI sent letters to Arabian Prince, Ice Cube and Eazy-E urging them to stop releasing their music as a response to the large amount of complaints they had received about the group's lyrical content and use of expletives.[24]

After Ice Cube left N.W.A over financial disputes, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group's second album Efil4zaggin. He also produced tracks for a number of other rap acts on Ruthless Records, including Above the Law, and The D.O.C. for the album No One Can Do It Better.[25] In 1991 at a music industry party in Hollywood, he assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, after he felt dissatisfied by a news report of hers on the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Thus, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500 and given two years' probation and 240 hours of community service, as well as a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television.[26][27]

The Chronic and Death Row Records (1992–1995)

    Further information: Death Row Records

After a dispute with Wright, Young left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Wright release Young from his contract and, using Dr. Dre as his flagship artist, found Death Row Records. In 1992 Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with a rapper whom he met through his own stepbrother and rapper Warren G, Snoop Dogg.[2] Dr. Dre's debut album was The Chronic under Death Row Records. Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content.[28]

On the strength of singles such as ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"", featuring protegé Snoop Doggy Dogg and hits like ""Let Me Ride"" and ""Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody's Celebratin')"" (known as ""Dre Day"" for radio and television play), The Chronic became a cultural phenomenon, its G-funk sound dominating much of hip hop music for the early 1990s.[2] In 1993 the Recording Industry Association of America certified the album multi-platinum,[29] and Dr. Dre also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for his performance in ""Let Me Ride"".[30] For that year, Billboard magazine also ranked Dr. Dre as the eighth best-selling musical artist, The Chronic as the sixth best-selling album, and ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"" as the 11th best-selling single.[3]

Besides working on his own material, Dr. Dre produced Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle, which became the first debut album for an artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 album charts.[31] Young also produced other West Coast rap albums of Death Row Records, including Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound and the album Regulate...G Funk Era by his stepbrother Warren G. In 1994 Dr. Dre produced the soundtracks to the films Above the Rim and Murder Was the Case and the single ""No Diggity"" by Blackstreet. He collaborated with fellow N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song ""Natural Born Killaz"" in 1995.[2]

In 1995, just as Death Row Records was signing rapper 2Pac and positioning him as their major star, Young left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that label boss Suge Knight was corrupt, financially dishonest and out of control. Thus, in 1996, he formed his own label Aftermath Entertainment directly underneath the distributor label for Death Row Records, Interscope Records.[2] Consequently, Death Row Records suffered poor sales by 1997, especially following the death of 2Pac and the racketeering charges brought against Knight.[32]

Move to Aftermath Entertainment (1996–1998)

    Further information: Aftermath Entertainment

The Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album, released on November 26, 1996, featured songs by Dr. Dre himself as well as by newly signed Aftermath artists, and a solo track ""Been There, Done That"", intended as a symbolic farewell to gangsta rap.[33] Despite being classified platinum by the RIAA[34], the album was not very popular among music fans.[2] In October 1996 Dr. Dre appeared on the sketch comedy program Saturday Night Live, broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States, to perform ""Been There, Done That"".[35] In 1997 Young produced several tracks on Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album; although the album went platinum, it was met with similarly negative reviews from critics. Rumors began to abound that Aftermath was facing financial difficulties.[36]

The turning point for Aftermath came in 1998, when Jimmy Iovine, the head of Aftermath's parent label Interscope, suggested that Young sign the white Detroit rapper Marshall Mathers, artistically known as Eminem, to Aftermath. Young produced three songs and provided vocals for two on his controversial album, (""My Name Is"", ""Guilty Conscience"" and ""Role Model"") in 1999.[37]

2001 (1999–2000)

    Main article: 2001 (album)

Dr. Dre's second solo album, 2001, released in the fall of 1999, was considered an ostentatious return to his gangsta rap roots.[38] It was initially titled The Chronic 2000 to imply being a sequel to his debut album The Chronic but was re-titled 2001 after Death Row Records released an unrelated compilation album earlier in 1999. Other tentative titles included The Chronic 2001 and Dr. Dre.[39] The album featured numerous collaborators, including Devin the Dude, Hittman, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg and Eminem. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website All Music Guide described the sound of the album as ""adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae"" to Dr. Dre's style.[38] The album was highly successful, charting at number two on the Billboard 200 charts[40] and has since been certified six times platinum,[29] thus reaffirming a recurring theme featured in its lyrics, stating that Dr. Dre was still a force to be reckoned with, despite the lack of major releases in the previous few years. The album included popular hit singles ""Still D.R.E."" and ""Forgot About Dre"", both of which Dr. Dre performed on NBC's Saturday Night Live on October 23, 1999.[41] Dr. Dre won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year in 2000,[2] and joined the Up in Smoke Tour with fellow rappers Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube that year as well.[42]

During the course of the popularity of 2001, Dr. Dre was involved in several lawsuits. Lucasfilm Ltd., the film company behind the Star Wars film franchise, sued him over the use of the THX-trademarked ""Deep Note"".[43] The Fatback Band also sued Dr. Dre over alleged infringement of its song ""Backstrokin'"" in his song ""Let's Get High"" from the 2001 album; Dr. Dre was ordered to pay $1.5 million to the band in 2003.[44] The online music file-sharing company Napster also settled a lawsuit with him and heavy metal rock band Metallica in the summer of 2001, agreeing to block access to certain files that artists do not want to have shared on the network.[45]

Focus on production (2001–present)

Following the success of 2001, Dr. Dre focused on producing songs and albums for other artists. He produced the single ""Family Affair"" by R&B singer Mary J. Blige for her album No More Drama in 2001.[4] Other successful albums that he produced for Aftermath have included the major-label debut album by Queens, New York-based rapper 50 Cent, Get Rich or Die Tryin', in 2003. The album featured the Dr. Dre-produced hit single ""In da Club"", as a joint production between Aftermath, Eminem's boutique label Shady Records and Interscope.[46] Dr. Dre also produced ""How We Do"", a 2005 hit single of rapper The Game from his album The Documentary.[47]

Another copyright-related lawsuit came upon Dr. Dre in the fall of 2002, when Sa Re Ga Ma, a film and music company based in Calcutta, India, sued Aftermath Entertainment over an uncredited sample of the Lata Mangeshkar song ""Thoda Resham Lagta Hai"" on the Aftermath-produced song ""Addictive"" by singer Truth Hurts. In February 2003, a judge ruled that Aftermath would have to halt sales of Truth Hurts' album Truthfully Speaking if the company would not credit Mangeshkar.[48] In April 2003 rapper Ja Rule released a mixtape of freestyle raps criticizing Dr. Dre and his associated artists 50 Cent and Eminem.[49] At the Vibe magazine awards show in November 2004, Dr. Dre was attacked by a fan named Jimmy James Johnson, who was asking for an autograph. Johnson, in September 2005, was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to stay away from Dr. Dre until 2008.[50] For an issue of Rolling Stone magazine in April 2005, Kanye West praised Dr. Dre as among the greatest performing artists of all time.[51]

In November 2006 Dr. Dre began working with Raekwon on his album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II.[52] He also contributed to the rap albums Buck the World by Young Buck[53] and Curtis by 50 Cent.[54] Other upcoming albums that he is involved with includeThe Reformation by Bishop Lamont,[55] The Nacirema Dream by Papoose,[56] Here I Am by Eve,[57] and L.A.X. by The Game.[58] Among planned but unreleased albums during Dr. Dre's tenure at Aftermath have included a full-length reunion with Snoop Dogg titled Breakup to Makeup, an album with fellow former N.W.A member Ice Cube which was to be titled Heltah Skeltah, an N.W.A reunion album, and a joint album with fellow producer Timbaland titled Chairmen of the Board.[59][25][60]

Detox: Final album

    Main article: Detox (Dr. Dre album)

Detox is to be Dr. Dre's final album.[7] In 2002, Dre told Corey Moss of MTV News that he intended Detox to be a concept album.[6] Work for the album dates back to early 2004,[61] but later in that year he decided to stop working on the album to focus on producing for other artists but then changed his mind; the album had initially been set for a fall 2005 release.[62] After several delays, the album was finally scheduled to be released sometime in 2008 by Interscope Records, which has not set a firm release date for the album as of September 2007.[7] Producers confirmed to work on the album include Bernard ""Focus"" Edwards Jr.,[63] Hi-Tek,[64] J.R. Rotem,[65] RZA,[66] Jay-Z,[67] and Warren G.[68]

Film career

In 2001 Dr. Dre appeared in the movies The Wash and Training Day.[69] A song of his, ""Bad Intentions"" (featuring Knoc-Turn'Al) and produced by Mahogany, was featured on The Wash soundtrack.[70] Dr. Dre also appeared on two other songs ""On the Blvd."" and ""The Wash"" along with his co-star Snoop Dogg. In February 2007 it was announced that Dr. Dre would produce dark comedies and horror films for New Line-owned company Crucial Films, along with longtime video director Phillip Atwell. Dr. Dre announced ""This is a natural switch for me, since I've directed a lot of music videos, and I eventually want to get into directing.""[71]

Musical influences and style

Dr. Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo.[59] In 2001 he told Time magazine, ""I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better.""[72] Other equipment he uses include the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland.[73]

After founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996, Dr. Dre took on producer Mel-Man as a co-producer, and his music took on a more synthesizer-based sound, using fewer vocal samples (as he had used on ""Lil' Ghetto Boy"" and ""Let Me Ride"" on The Chronic, for example). Mel-Man has not shared co-production credits with Dr. Dre since approximately 2002, but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel-Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound.[74]

In 1999 Dr. Dre started working with Mike Elizondo, a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as Poe, Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette,[75] for his album 2001. Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr. Dre's productions.[76][77] Dr. Dre also told Scratch magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter Burt Bacharach by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future.[59]

Work ethic

Dr. Dre has stated that he is a perfectionist, and is known to pressure the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances.[59] In 2006 Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr. Dre had made new artist Chauncey Black re-record a single bar of vocals 107 times.[78] Dr. Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his like-minded work ethic.[59]

A consequence of this perfectionism is that some artists that initially sign deals with Dr. Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash. featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr. Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman and 1980s rap icon Rakim.[79]

However, over the years word of other collaborators has surfaced. During his tenure at Death Row Records, it was alleged that Dr. Dre's half brother Warren G and Tha Dogg Pound member Daz made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album The Chronic and Snoop Doggy Dogg's album Doggystyle (Daz received production credits on Snoop's similar-sounding, albeit less successful album Tha Doggfather after Young left Death Row Records).[80]

It is known that Scott Storch, who has since gone on to become a successful producer in his own right, contributed to Dr. Dre's second album 2001; Storch is credited as a songwriter on several songs and played keyboards on several tracks. In 2006 he told Rolling Stone:

    ""At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something,"" Storch says. ""He needed a fuel injection, and Dr. Dre utilized me as the nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [Elizondo] was on the bass guitar, and Dr. Dre was on the drum machine"".[81]

Current collaborator Mike Elizondo, when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians. In 2004 he claimed to Songwriter Universe magazine that he had written the foundations of the hit Eminem song ""The Real Slim Shady"", stating, ""I initially played a bass line on the song, and Dr. Dre, Tommy Coster Jr. and I built the track from there. Eminem then heard the track, and he wrote the rap to it.""[77] This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book Angry Blonde, stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr. Dre was out of the studio but later programmed the song's beat after returning.[82]

Furthermore, in the September 2003 issue of The Source, a group of disgruntled former associates of Dr. Dre complained that they had not received their full due for work on the label. A producer named Neff-U claimed to have produced the songs ""Say What You Say"" and ""My Dad's Gone Crazy"" on The Eminem Show, the songs ""If I Can't"" and ""Back Down"" on 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin', and the beat featured on Dr. Dre's commercial for Coors beer.[79]

Although Young studies piano and musical theory, he serves as more of a conductor than a musician himself, as Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine has noted:

    Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound. ""My greatest talent,"" Dre says, ""is knowing exactly what I want to hear.""[72]

Although Snoop Dogg retains working relationships with Warren G and Daz, who are alleged to be uncredited contributors on the hit albums The Chronic and Doggystyle, he states that Dr. Dre is capable of making beats without the help of collaborators.[83] It should be noted that Dr. Dre's prominent studio collaborators, including Scott Storch, Elizondo, Mark Batson and Dawaun Parker, have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer.

It is also widely acknowledged that most of Dr. Dre's raps are written for him by others, though he retains ultimate control over his lyrics and the themes of his songs. As Aftermath Producer Mahogany told Scratch: ""It's like a class room in [the booth]. He'll have three writers in there. They'll bring in something, he'll recite it, then he'll say. 'Change this line, change this word,' like he's grading papers.""[84] As seen in the credits for tracks Young has appeared on, there are often multiple people who contribute to his songs (although it should be noted that often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, even the producer). As a member of N.W.A, The D.O.C. wrote lyrics for him while he stuck with producing.[85] Popular rapper Jay-Z ghostwrote lyrics for the single ""Still D.R.E."" from Dr. Dre's album 2001.[39]

Personal life

Marriages and family

From 1990 to 1996 Dr. Dre dated singer Michel'le, who frequently contributed vocals to Death Row Records albums. In 1991 the couple had a son, Marcel. In May 1996 Dr. Dre married Nicole Threatt, who was formerly married to NBA player Sedale Threatt.[86] Dr. Dre and Nicole have two children together: a son named Truth (born 1997) and a daughter named Truly (born 2001).[87] He is also the biological father of rapper Hood Surgeon (real name Curtis Young), impregnating his mother, Lisa Johnson, at 16 when he was 17.[88]

Income

In 2001, Dr. Dre earned a total of about $52 million from selling part of his share of Aftermath Entertainment to Interscope Records and his production of such hit songs that year as ""Family Affair"" by Mary J. Blige. Rolling Stone magazine thus named him the second highest-paid artist of the year.[4] Dr. Dre was ranked 44th in 2004 from earnings of just $11.4 million, primarily from production royalties from such projects as albums from G-Unit and D12 and the single ""Rich Girl"" by singer Gwen Stefani and rapper Eve.[5]

Chance the Rapper,"Chancelor Bennett (born April 16, 1993), better known by his stage name Chance The Rapper, is an American hip hop recording artist from Chicago, Illinois. In 2013, he began to gain recognition following the release of his first two mixtapes. Chance first made some noise on the Chicago hip-hop blog Fake Shore Drive with his video for Nostalgia in early 2011. His latest mixtape, Coloring Book, was released for free on Apple Music on 12 May 2016.

Chance achieved some success with his first mixtape 10Day, which details his 10 day long suspension from his high school. On April 30, 2013, Chance's second mixtape, Acid Rap dropped. It received diamond status from Datpiff. The Social Experiment, Chance's band with Donnie Trumpet, Peter Cottontail, and members of the O'My's, released their free album, Surf, on May 28, 2015. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Chance+the+Rapper"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

DJ Shadow,"Considered a prominent figure in the development of instrumental hip-hop, DJ Shadow (real name Josh Davis) has proven himself with groundbreaking, genre-defining solo output on such respected labels as Solesides and Mo' Wax.

DJ Shadow spent his teenage years in Davis, California and was a DJ at the community radio station KDVS. During his time as a radio disc jockey, DJ Shadow was significant in developing the experimental instrumental hip-hop style associated with the California-based Solesides record label. His early singles for the label, including In/Flux and Lost and Found (S.F.L.), were genre-bending works of art merging elements of funk, rock, hip-hop, ambient, jazz, soul, and used-bin found records. DJ Shadow is often cited as a leading creator of trip-hop, though this is a label he strongly contests.

Although he previously released a couple of original works (during 1991-1992 for Hollywood Records) by the time Mo' Wax's James Lavelle contacted him about releasing In/Flux on the fledgling imprint, it wasn't until his distribution association with Mo' Wax that his sound began to mature and cohere.

Shadow's first full-length work, Endtroducing....., was released in late 1996 to immense critical acclaim. Following the success of this album, he acted as a shadow producer for Rage Against The Machine for their album, Evil Empire. It is said he influenced the solo on their song ""Bulls On Parade"". Endtroducing... made the Guinness World Records book for ""First Completely Sampled Album"" in 2001. Preemptive Strike, a compilation of early singles, followed in early 1998. Later that year, Shadow produced tracks for Psyence Fiction, the debut album by U.N.K.L.E., a long-time Mo' Wax production team that gained superstar guests including Thom Yorke (of Radiohead), Richard Ashcroft (of The Verve), Mike D (of the Beastie Boys) and others. His next project came in 1999, with the transformation of Solesides into a new label, Quannum Projects. Nearly six years after his debut production album, his second album, The Private Press, was released in June 2002. In the same year, the movie ""Scratch"" (2001, Doug Pray) was released to DVD with DJ Shadow appearing several times throughout the movie.

The documentary films ""Dark Days"" and ""Wisconsin Death Trip"" feature music of DJ Shadow while ""Scratch"" features an interview and more music.

DJ Shadow has also collaborated with fellow artist Cut Chemist. Together they have made two CDs entitled Brainfreeze and Product Placement. These albums fuse jazz, funk, and soul in the framework of a cohesive concept. The second of these (Product Placement) followed a very similar pattern to the first, but using remixes/other versions of the songs in roughly the same order.

In the year 2004, Shadow released his feature length DVD, In Tune and On Time. The DVD features a live performance in London, emphasizing intricate visuals.

In 2005, Shadow released a Deluxe Edition of his first album, Endtroducing.... and a new album, titled ""The Outsider"" in 2006.

While Shadow's earlier works, especially 'Endtroducing.....', are known for their innovation in genres such as hip-hop, ambient, and trip-hop, his fourth full length album, The Outsider, had several tracks dedicated to Hyphy. This decision has been controversial, leaving many fans feeling alienated. DJ Shadow addressed this point in an August, 2006 interview, in which stated, ""Repeat Endtroducing over and over again? That was never, ever in the game plan. Fuck that. So I think it's time for certain fans to decide if they are fans of the album, or the artist.""

Also in 2005, Brian Udelhofen began work on the Shadow Percussion Project, an attempt to adapt some of the tracks from Endtroducing... for a live performance group. The result was largely successful and well-received by DJ Shadow himself.

In 2007 DJ Shadow was contacted by the Hollywood Bowl to do a show featuring Freeze with Cut Chemist. However, not wanting to repeat old material DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist came up with a whole new routine entitled The Hard Sell. In 2007 and 2008 they went on The Hard Sell tour and were accompanied on stage by two large video screens with visuals created for the tour.

Wilco,"Wilco is a rock band which formed in 1994 in Chicago, Illinois, United States by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure from that group. Wilco's lineup has changed frequently, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. The other current members are guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalists Pat Sansone and Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released e⃥i⃥g⃥h⃥t⃥ nine studio albums, a live double album, and three collaborations: two with Billy Bragg, and one with The Minus 5.

Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay and Television, and has in turn influenced music by The National and Cherry Ghost. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music.

Wilco garnered media attention for its fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say that the album showed ""how screwed up the music business [was] in the early twenty-first century."" Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 590,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost Is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album.

The I Might Songfacts reports that Wilco's eighth album, The Whole Love (2011), marked the first ever release on the band's own label dBpm.

Formation

Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo. Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 supposedly because of a soured relationship with co-singer Jeff Tweedy. Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including bassist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band. The group named itself ""Wilco"" after the CB radio voice procedure for ""I Will Comply"". [N.B. this term originates in World War 2 Battle of Britain Fighter pilot slang for will co-operate, if not earlier in the Royal Air Force]

A.M. and Being There

After collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song, ""The T.B. is Whipping Me"" (released in September 1994 on the Red Hot + Country compilation), Wilco began recording tracks for A.M., their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1995. A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract. Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission—John Stirratt's ""It's Just That Simple""—appeared on A.M.. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was solely written by a member besides Tweedy.

Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on A.M. was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as ""trying to tread some water with a perceived audience."" A.M. peaked at number twenty-seven on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, Son Volt. The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the Village Voice's 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt's album, the Wilco members perceived A.M. to be a failure. Shortly after the release of the album, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band, providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist.

Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, Missouri (the band was billed for the occasion as ""Black Shampoo"").

During the two hundred-date tour supporting A.M., Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated:
""The whole No Depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on 'Misunderstood,' where I'm playing guitar.""
A number of songs were recorded with this theme, including ""Sunken Treasure"" and ""Hotel Arizona"", however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of A.M. Wilco named the album Being There after a Peter Sellers film of the same name. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio, playing pedal steel guitar on ""Far, Far Away"" and ""Dreamer in My Dreams"", and then became an official member in September 1996.

Unlike the A.M. recording sessions, the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort. The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied. Being There was well-received by critics from several major media outlets, including Rolling Stone. The album reached #73 on the Billboard album charts, a significant improvement from A.M., and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996.

Summerteeth and the Mermaid Avenue sessions

In November 1997, Wilco entered Willie Nelson's recording studio in Spicewood, Texas to record a third studio album. The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century literature. Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's ""bold, but depressing"" lyrics. Wilco recorded several songs, including ""Via Chicago"" and ""She's a Jar,"" but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.

Nora Guthrie contacted singer-songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer Woody Guthrie. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington's disease. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a ""relic"" to the MTV generation, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was ""the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody."" Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.

Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their Being There tour. Bragg was particularly fond of Being There because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols—Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Bragg mostly recorded the politically-charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a ""freak weirdo."" The recording of Mermaid Avenue began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of BBC's Man in the Sand documentary film.

Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded with ""you make your record, and I'll make mine, fucker."" Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.

Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies. The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998. After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach.

After the completion of the Mermaid Avenue sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, Summerteeth. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools. Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:""The story of Summerteeth is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness … It reminds me of Heart of Darkness, where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for.""
During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc.. As a result, Warner's imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, Howie Klein, who had previously authorized the release of Being There as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce Summerteeth without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this ""once and once only"" and recorded a radio-friendly version of ""Can't Stand It"" at the request of David Kahne, the head of the A&R department. The single version of ""Can't Stand It"" failed to cross over from Triple-A radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than Being There. This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999.

After the release of Summerteeth, the band resumed the Mermaid Avenue sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II. ""Someday Some Morning Sometime,"" featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo, was identified by Tweedy as being the ""piece to the puzzle"" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions.

Yankee Hotel Foxtrot

Shortly after the recording sessions for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II, Wilco purchased a studio in Irving Park, Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft. The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O'Rourke at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's Bad Timing. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur. Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.

Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities against those of O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground. Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"", and the results impressed the other band members—even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as ""Poor Places"", only featured the Loose Fur trio. The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett left the band immediately afterwards. The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.

Time Warner, which owned Warner Brothers, merged with America Online in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise. Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions. He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.

Wilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy-out from Reprise. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request. However, Allmusic claims that Wilco ""bought the finished studio tapes from Warner/Reprise for a reported $50,000 and left the label altogether"" after Wilco was ""unwilling to change the album to make it more 'commercially viable.'"" To curb the negative publicity, Reprise began to invest more in bands such as The Flaming Lips. Lead singer Wayne Coyne once remarked: ""We are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, 'we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again.' They'd tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me!""
As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it at their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality MP3s. The band signed with Nonesuch Records, another Time Warner subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002. When it was released, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot reached number thirteen on the Billboard 200, Wilco's highest chart position to that date. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sold over 590,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco's best selling album. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was met with wide critical acclaim: it topped 2002's Pazz & Jop critics' poll, was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by Q Magazine, and was named one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time by Rolling Stone.

Down with Wilco, A Ghost Is Born, and Kicking Television: Live in Chicago

While waiting for the commercial release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco agreed to support R.E.M. collaborator Scott McCaughey for an album release by The Minus 5. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the 9/11 terrorist attacks that day. Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to ""create something good in the world right now"" and record some material. Influenced by Bill Fay's Time of the Last Persecution, The Minus 5's Down with Wilco was released in 2003.

In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. Unlike Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost Is Born featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live. The album featured the song ""Less Than You Think"", which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called ""the track that everyone will hate"". Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song: ""I know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say its a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great … I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it.""
Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album's completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago. Like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release. Instead of using their own web page, the band streamed it in MPEG-4 form on Apple's website. Wilco sought to substantially change their lineup after Bach's departure, and added Mikael Jorgensen, who had engineered Down with Wilco, Pat Sansone of The Autumn Defense, and avant-garde guitarist Nels Cline to the lineup. Just as the band was about to tour to promote the album, Tweedy checked himself in to a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago for an addiction to painkillers. As a result, tour plans for Europe were canceled, and the release date for the album was set back several weeks. A Ghost Is Born was released on June 22, 2004, and became Wilco's first top ten album in the U.S. The album earned Wilco Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005. It also placed thirteenth on 2004's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.

In 2004, the band released The Wilco Book, a picture book detailing the creation of A Ghost Is Born. The book also contains writings and drawings from band members, as well as a CD with demos from the A Ghost Is Born recording sessions. Also that year, Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot released a biography of the band entitled Wilco: Learning How to Die. The new six-piece Wilco lineup debuted on Kicking Television: Live in Chicago, a two disc live album recorded at The Vic Theater in Chicago. Released on November 15, 2005, the album received high accolades from Spin, Billboard, and Entertainment Weekly. As of 2007, it has sold over 114,000 copies.

Sky Blue Sky

Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by The Byrds and Fairport Convention, the band considered Sky Blue Sky to be less experimental than previous releases. Also unlike previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations.

Wilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song ""What Light"" as a free MP3 download. To further publicize the album, Wilco licensed several songs from the Sky Blue Sky recording sessions for use in a Volkswagen advertising campaign. The move was criticized by both critics and fans; Wilco responded by noting that they had previously done advertising campaigns with Apple Computers and Telefónica Móviles (Movistar). The album was released on May 15, 2007, and was a commercial success: it sold over 87,000 copies in its first week and peaked in the top five in the U.S. album charts. It also was a top forty hit in seven other countries.

Reviewer James Brubaker states that Wilco “shines on a handful of the songs” on Sky Blue Sky, such as the “light, and straightforward” songs. While he calls the album “great traditional rock and folk album at times”, he states that “once you get past the handful of masterful and lovely performances… the rest of the record comes off at times as dull, and forced”. The allaboutjazz review also had mixed comments. While praising the album as “deceptively insinuating, almost intoxicating to listen to” and noting its “impeccable sound quality”, the reviewer claimed that “Sky Blue Sky becomes the first Wilco album that sounds too careful for its own good.”

Pabs Hernandez, a reviewer for Lost at Sea praised the album’s “breezy atmosphere and pacing”, and noted that it is not “easily judged upon first listen.” Overall, Hernandez stated that it “may be no masterpiece, but at worst it's a more than worthy entry into Wilco's laudable catalogue.” Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as “one of the best albums of the year”, calling it a “timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class” and “a lean, mean, soulful album.” Like Hernandez, Locke acknowledged that the album could not be properly judged just on the first listening. The NPR review also had a positive take on the record. While the NPR reviewer stated that the recording “isn't groundbreaking”, they praised its “coherent musical expression” and emphasis on “solid songcraft without pretense” which created a “satisfying and melodically sound albu[m].”

Musical style and influence

Wilco's music is typically categorized as alternative rock and alternative country. Despite their career long association with a major record label, they are generally associated with indie rock. Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres, but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974. John Cale's Paris 1919 was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, ""It was eye-opening that I wasn't the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they'd been given credit for—that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y'know?""

Other recording artists from that timespan appreciated by the band include John Lennon, Neil Young, and Brian Wilson. For his thirty-fourth birthday, Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from Richard Lloyd of Television; Tweedy was a big fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work, which he wanted to incorporate into his music. Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as Jason & the Scorchers and The Minutemen, influencing the recording of Wilco's A.M.. Tweedy and O'Rourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Derek Bailey; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The lyrical structure of Wilco's songs were dictated by classic literature and cadavre exquis—an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously written line. Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H. Gass's In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, and Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry.

Some critics have dubbed Wilco the ""American Radiohead"", due to their stylistically diverse catalog. A critic from the New York Times argues that Wilco has a ""roots-rock...[sound which] reached back to proven materials: the twang of country, the steady chug of 1960s rock, the undulating sheen of the Beach Boys, the honky-tonk hymns of the Band and the melodic symmetries of pop.""

Rolling Stone described Wilco as ""one of America's most consistently interesting bands"" and ""America's foremost rock impressionists."" Despite critical acclaim, Wilco's influence on modern rock has been limited. Bands that have been influenced by Wilco include Derek Webb (of Caedmon's Call), The National, and Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. English indie rock band Cherry Ghost took its name from a lyric from the Wilco song ""Theologians"" (from A Ghost Is Born)—lead singer Simon Aldred is a self-proclaimed ""massive Wilco fan"". Pete Yorn's song ""Crystal Village"" was influenced by Wilco's ""She's A Jar."" On his 2004 album Live From New Jersey he introduces the song by saying, ""Someone accused me of ripping off Cat Stevens. And I was like, 'That's bullshit, man. I would never rip off Cat Stevens.' I ripped off Wilco on that song.""

Miley Cyrus,"Miley Ray Cyrus (born Destiny Hope Cyrus; November 23, 1992 in Nashville, Tennessee, United States) is an American actress and pop singer. She gained fame for her role as Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel sitcom Hannah Montana, which began in 2006 and ended in 2010. Cyrus recorded music for the soundtracks Hannah Montana (2006) and Hannah Montana 2/Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), released by Walt Disney Records, which helped establish her as a teen idol. In 2007, Cyrus signed to Hollywood Records for a solo career. She went on the Best of Both Worlds Tour the same year; the tour was eventually turned into a high-grossing concert film entitled Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert (2008).
In April 2008, Cyrus released her first solo album, Breakout (2008), which experienced international success and she was included in Time magazine's 2008 Top 100. She began her foray into films by providing the voice of ""Penny"" in the animated film Bolt (2008) and by reprising the role of Miley in Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009). Bolt's theme song, ""I Thought I Lost You"", earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Hannah Montana: The Movie' soundtrack introduced her to new audiences within country and adult contemporary markets.
She began to cultivate an adult image in 2009 with the release of The Time of Our Lives (2009), an extended play which presented a more mainstream pop sound, and by filming The Last Song (2010), a coming-of-age drama film. The former included Cyrus's best-selling single, ""Party in the U.S.A."" (2009). Cyrus ranked number twenty-nine on Forbes' 2009 Celebrity 100. An upcoming studio album titled Can't Be Tamed will be released in 2010 and presents a new dance-pop sound. The music video and lyrics of the album's lead single, ""Can't Be Tamed"", portrays a more sexualized image for the entertainer. Cyrus has stated that she intends to focus on acting rather than singing in the future. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Iggy Pop,"Iggy Pop (born James Newell Osterberg, Jr.; April 21, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Though widely known as an innovator and ""godfather"" of punk rock, Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the years, including pop, hard rock, jazz and blues. Pop became known as 'Iggy' in high school, during which time he served as drummer for local blues band The Iguanas. He is vocalist of influential proto-punk band The Stooges (Pop and the other surviving members of the group reunited in 2003), having become known, since the late 1960s, for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics.

Though his popularity has fluctuated through the years, many of Pop's songs have become well-known, including ""Lust for Life"", ""The Passenger"", ""Real Wild Child"", ""Candy"" (a duet with Kate Pierson of The B-52's), ""China Girl"", ""Nightclubbing"", ""Search and Destroy"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"".

In 2010, The Stooges were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Pop was the lead singer of The Stooges, a late 1960s/early 1970s band that featured brothers Ron and Scott Asheton and Dave Alexander and was highly influential in the development of hard rock. The debut album was produced by the Velvet Underground's John Cale. The band's ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" is a garage punk standard.

Raw Power was first released in1973, perhaps the first record that could truly be called punk. It was the confluence of The Stooges ages, hormones, creativity, ability, experience, tastes, lack of supervision, contempt for authority and ambition that has made Raw Power one of the most influential albums of all time.

The Stooges were infamous for performances in which Pop leapt off the stage (hence, the ""stage dive""), smeared raw meat or peanut butter over his chest and cut himself with broken bottles. A glimpse of the vibrating intensity of Iggy live can be seen in the Ramones movie ""End of the Century."" Guitarist James Williamson became a key collaborator, a partnership documented on the 1978 album Kill City.

In 25 years as a solo artist, Pop's best-known songs have included the thumping Lust for Life, to be heard on the soundtrack of the find-a-vein, shoot-it-up movie Trainspotting, I'm Bored and The Passenger (the latter based on a poem written by Jim Morrison). David Bowie played a key role in reinvigorating Pop's post-Stooges career and was a collaborator on the albums Lust for Life and The Idiot. Iggy may be under-rated as a songwriter. Bowie and Tina Turner covered his ""Tonight"". Bowie also put out his own version of ""China Girl,"" while Grace Jones covered the icey ""Nightclubbing"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Iggy+Pop"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lynyrd Skynyrd,"Lynyrd Skynyrd (pronounced /ˌlɛnərd ˈskɪnərd/ LEN-ərd-SKIN-ərd) is a Southern Rock band, formed in Jacksonville, Florida, USA in 1964. The band became prominent in the Southern United States in 1973, and rose to worldwide recognition before three members and one road crew member died in an airplane crash in 1977. The band reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with lead singer Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother Johnny as the frontman. Lynyrd Skynyrd continues to tour and record. Of its original members, only Gary Rossington remains with the band as of 2010. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006.

History
Early years

In the summer of 1964, teenage friends Ronnie Van Zant, Allen Collins, and Gary Rossington, formed the band ""The Noble Five"", which then changed in 1965 to ""My Backyard"", when Larry Junstrom and Bob Burns joined in Jacksonville, Florida. Their early influences included British Invasion bands such as Free, The Yardbirds, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles, as well as Southern blues and country & western music. In 1968, the group won a local Battle of the Bands contest and the opening slot on several Southeast shows for the California-based psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock.

In 1970, Van Zant sought a new name. ""One Percent"" and ""The Noble Five"" were each considered before the group settled on Leonard Skinnerd, a mocking tribute to a physical-education teacher at Robert E. Lee High School, Leonard Skinner, who was notorious for strictly enforcing the school's policy against boys having long hair. The more distinctive spelling was adopted before they released their first album. Despite their high school acrimony, the band developed a friendlier relationship with Skinner in later years, and invited him to introduce them at a concert in the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum.

In 1970, the band auditioned for Alan Walden, who would later become their manager on the newly formed Hustler's Inc. Walden worked with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Pete Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving, blues-rock sound and image, and experimenting with making studio recordings.

During this time, they went through a number of member changes, with Van Zant, Collins and Rossington remaining the only constants. Burns and Junstrom left the band, and were briefly replaced by Rickey Medlocke on drums and Greg Walker on bass. In 1971, with this lineup, they made some recordings at the famous Muscle Shoals studio. By the time they made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns had rejoined the band and Leon Wilkeson had become Larry Junstrom's permanent replacement on bass, with Medlocke and Walker having left to play with the southern rock band Blackfoot. Around this time, the band occasionally played shows with both Burns and Medlocke participating, utilizing a dual-drummer approach similar to that of The Allman Brothers. Also in 1972, roadie Billy Powell became the keyboardist for the band.

Peak years (1973–1977)

In 1972 the band was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer Al Kooper of Blood, Sweat, and Tears, who had attended one of their shows at a club in Atlanta. They changed the spelling of their name to ""Lynyrd Skynyrd"", (pronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd) and Kooper signed them to MCA Records, producing their first album (pronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd). Leon Wilkeson left just before the band was to record the album (Wilkeson rejoined the band shortly thereafter at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover).[citation needed] Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King joined the band and played Wilkeson's parts on the album, along with some guitar. King switched to guitar after the album's release, allowing the band to replicate the three-guitar mix used in the studio. Released January 1, 1973, the album featured the hit song ""Free Bird"", which received national airplay, eventually reaching #19 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, and is still considered a rock and roll anthem today.

Lynyrd Skynyrd's fan base continued to grow rapidly throughout 1973, largely due to their opening slot on The Who's Quadrophenia tour in the United States. On their 1974 follow-up, Second Helping, the band successfully avoided sophomore slump, with King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting. The album was the band's breakthrough hit, and featured their most popular single, ""Sweet Home Alabama"" (#8 on the charts in August 1974), a response to Neil Young's ""Alabama"" and ""Southern Man."" (Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other's music and good friends; Young even wrote the song ""Powderfinger"" for the band, but they never recorded it. Van Zant, meanwhile, can be seen on the cover of Street Survivors wearing a Neil Young t-shirt.) The album reached #12 in 1974, eventually going multi-platinum. In July of that year, Lynyrd Skynyrd was one of the headline acts at The Ozark Music Festival at the Missouri State Fairgrounds in Sedalia, Missouri.

In January, 1975, Burns left the band and was replaced by Kentucky native Artimus Pyle on drums. Lynyrd Skynyrd's third album, Nuthin' Fancy, was released the same year. The album had lower sales than its predecessor, and Kooper was eventually fired. Midway through the tour, Ed King left the band, citing tour exhaustion. In January 1976, backup singers Leslie Hawkins, Cassie Gaines and JoJo Billingsley (collectively known as The Honkettes) were added to the band, although they were not considered as official members. Lynyrd Skynyrd's fourth album Gimme Back My Bullets was released in the new year, but did not achieve the same success as the previous two albums. Van Zant and Collins both felt that the band was seriously missing the three-guitar attack that had been one of its early hallmarks. Although Skynyrd auditioned several guitarists, including such high-profile names as Leslie West, the solution was closer than they realized.

Soon after joining Skynyrd, Cassie Gaines began touting the guitar and songwriting prowess of her younger brother, Steve. The junior Gaines, who led his own band, Crawdad (which occasionally would perform Skynyrd's ""Saturday Night Special"" in their set), was invited to audition onstage with Skynyrd at a concert in Kansas City on May 11, 1976. Liking what they heard, the group also jammed informally with the Oklahoma native several times, then invited him into the group in June. With Gaines on board, the newly-reconstituted band recorded the double-live album One More From the Road at the Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia) in Atlanta, and performed at the Knebworth festival, which also featured The Rolling Stones.

Both Collins and Rossington had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976 which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous ""That Smell"" - a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he's the ""Prince Charming"" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on Quaaludes. Van Zant, at least, was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.

1977's Street Survivors turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist Steve Gaines, who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the multiple talents of Skynyrd's newest member, claiming that the band would ""all be in his shadow one day."" Gaines' contributions included his co-lead vocal with Van Zant on the co-written ""You Got That Right"" and the rousing guitar boogie ""I Know A Little"" which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Gaines' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy ""Ain't No Good Life"" - the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles ""What's Your Name"" and ""That Smell"". The band was poised for their biggest tour yet, including fulfilling Van Zant's lifelong dream of headlining New York's Madison Square Garden.

Plane crash (1977)

On Thursday, October 20, 1977, just three days after the release of Street Survivors, and five shows into their most successful headlining tour to date, Lynyrd Skynyrd's chartered Convair 240 ran out of fuel near the end of their flight from Greenville, South Carolina, where they had just performed at the Greenville Memorial Auditorium, to LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Though the pilots attempted an emergency landing on a small airstrip, the plane crashed in a forest in Gillsburg, Mississippi. Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot William Gray were all killed on impact; the other bandmembers suffered serious injuries.

Following the crash and the ensuing press, Street Survivors became the band's second platinum album and reached #5 on the U.S. album chart. The single ""What's Your Name"" reached #13 on the single airplay charts in January 1978.

The original cover sleeve for Street Survivors had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, engulfed in flames. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve's widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with a similar image of the band against a simple black background. Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of Street Survivors, the original ""flames"" cover was restored.

Lynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting just once to perform an instrumental version of ""Free Bird"" at Charlie Daniels' Volunteer Jam in January 1979. Collins, Rossington, Powell and Pyle performed the song with Charlie Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins.

Hiatus (1977–1987)

Rossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed The Rossington-Collins Band, which released two albums between 1980 and 1982. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, Dale Krantz, as lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgment of their past, the band's concert encore would always be an instrumental version of ""Free Bird"". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed the Rossington Band, which released two albums in the late 1980s and opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987-1988.

The other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era.Leon Wilkeson on bass and  Billy Powellon keyboards played  in a Christian Rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker Mylon LeFevre (who, like Skynyrd, had once opened for The Who). During Vision concerts, Powell's trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash. Pyle formed The Artimus Pyle Band in 1982, which occasionally featured former Honkettes JoJo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins.

In 1980 Allen Collins' wife Kathy died of a massive hemorrhage while miscarrying their third child. He formed the Allen Collins Band in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington-Collins Band, releasing one tepidly-received album, but many around him believed that the guitarist's heart just wasn't in it anymore. Most point to his wife's death as the moment that Collins' life began to spin out of control; he spent several years bingeing on drugs and alcohol. In 1986 Collins crashed his car while driving drunk near his home in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend and leaving him permanently paralyzed from the chest down. Collins eventually pled no contest to DUI manslaughter, but was not given a prison sentence since his injuries made it obvious that he would never drive or be a danger to society again.

Return (1987–present)

In 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the post-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to Collins' paralysis from the 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. As part of his plea deal, Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of ""That Smell"", which had been partially directed at him). Collins was stricken with pneumonia in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990.

The reunited band was meant to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album Southern By The Grace Of God/Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour - 1987. The fact that the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not ""exploit"" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso which forces any band touring as ""Lynyrd Skynyrd"" to include at least two from among Rossington, Collins, Powell, Pyle, Wilkeson and King. Apparently, that proviso is not being enforced, seeing that Rossington is now the sole member of that group left in Lynyrd Skynyrd, as King was not allowed to remain in the band after missing a tour unable to tour due to heart problems, Pyle is on the outs with Rossington and Johnny Van Zant, and the others are now dead. Pyle has insisted in public appearances that ""Ronnie Van Zandt IS Lynyrd Skynyrd"", and wishes nothing to do with the current makeup of the band bearing that name. Two other founding members of the band remain alive, original drummer Bob Burns and bassist Larry Junstrom Bob Burns, but they have not participated in the post-crash band.

The reconstituted Lynyrd Skynyrd has gone through a large number of lineup changes and continues to record and tour today. One by one, the members of the pre-crash band have left, been forced out, or have passed away. Artimus Pyle left the band in 1991 and his place has been taken by a variety of drummers since, with Michael Cartellone finally becoming his permanent replacement. Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes in 1993. Ed King had to take a break from touring in 1996. In his absence, he was replaced by Hughie Thomasson. King has stated that his break from the band was to be temporary, but the band did not let him rejoin after he recovered. At the same time, Mike Estes was replaced by Rickey Medlocke, who had briefly played drums with the band in the early 1970's. Leon Wilkeson, Skynyrd's bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001; his death was found to be due to emphysema and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by Ean Evans. The remaining members released a double album called Thyrty which had songs from the original line up to the present. Lynyrd Skynyrd also released a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour and on June 22, 2004, Lynyrd Skynyrd released the album Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour. On December 10, 2004, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a show for CMT, Crossroads, a concert featuring country duo Montgomery Gentry and other genres of music. In the beginning of 2005 Hughie Thomasson left the band to reform his disbanded Southern Rock band Outlaws. Thomasson died in his sleep on September 9, 2007 of an apparent heart attack in his home in Brooksville, Florida. He was 55 years old.

On February 5, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a Super Bowl party back in Jacksonville with special guests 3 Doors Down, Jo Dee Messina, Charlie Daniels and Ronnie and Johnny Van Zant's brother Donnie Van Zant of 38 Special. On February 13 of that year Lynyrd Skynyrd did a tribute to Southern Rock on the Grammy Awards with Gretchen Wilson, Tim McGraw, Keith Urban and Dickey Betts. On May 10, 2005, Johnny and Donnie Van Zant released a country album called Get Right with the Man which featured the hit single ""Help Somebody"". In the summer of 2005, lead singer Johnny Van Zant had to have surgery on his vocal cord to have a polyp removed. He was told not to sing for three months. On September 10, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd performed without Johnny Van Zant at the Music Relief Concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, with Kid Rock standing in for Johnny. In December 2005, Johnny Van Zant returned to sing for Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band performed live at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, as a part of their 2007 tour. The concert was recorded in high definition for HDNet and premiered on December 1, 2007.
The band in 2008

Mark ""Sparky"" Matejka, formerly of the country music band Hot Apple Pie, joined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 2006 as Thomasson's replacement. On November 2, 2007, the band performed at Gator Growl, the world's largest student-run pep rally, in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium - also known as ""The Swamp."" The event's 50,000-person attendance marked the largest crowd that Lynyrd Skynyrd had ever played in front of in the United States, until the July 2008 Bama Jam in Enterprise, Alabama where more than 111,000 people were in attendance.

On January 28, 2009, keyboardist Billy Powell died at age 56 at his home near Jacksonville, Florida. Powell called 911 at 12:55 a.m., complaining of shortness of breath. He had previously missed his doctor's appointment on the day before his death; the appointment was for a checkup on his heart. The EMS responders found Powell unconscious and unresponsive, with the telephone still in his hand. Rescue crews performed CPR, but he was pronounced dead at 1:52 a.m. Although a heart attack was suspected, and it was originally reported that an autopsy was to be performed, none in fact was ever done. Powell's death left Gary Rossington as the sole pre-crash member of the band, unless Rickey Medlocke's brief stint with the band in the early 1970's is counted. On March 17, 2009, it was announced that Skynyrd had signed a worldwide deal with Roadrunner Records, in association with their label, Loud & Proud Records, and released their new album God & Guns on September 29 of that year. They toured Europe and the United States in 2009 with Peter Keys of the 420 Funk Mob on keyboards and Robert Kearns of The Bottle Rockets on bass (in place of Ean Evans, who died of cancer at age 48 on May 6, 2009, at his home in Columbus, Mississippi). Scottish rock band Gun have been confirmed as special guests for the UK leg of Skynyrds tour in 2010.

Deep Purple,"Deep Purple is an English hard rock band that formed in Hertfordshire in 1968. Together with groups such as  Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, they're considered as heavy metal pioneers. Especially influential to later metal bands were Ian Gillan's powerful screams and Ritchie Blackmore's virtuoso solos. Deep Purple were also very influential to progressive music as well, with their style evolving over the years and incorporating a variety of genres from art rock to blues to psychedelia and more.

The Early Days:
Deep Purple's early output ranged from energetic rock (such as their cover of Joe South's ""Hush"", which became an iconic radio hit that climbed to #4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart) to strongly classically influenced pieces (such as ""April"", a fan-loved gem from their third album). Their first few albums contained very long solos, such as those on the band's covers of ""Hey Joe"" and ""I'm So Glad"". The appeal of the more heavy, arena-friendly tracks from the group brought them considerable success in the U.S., setting them apart from many English contemporaries, particularly in their 1968 debut album 'Shades of Deep Purple'.

After their third album, founding member and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore in particular felt the band should move in a harder direction. He additionally felt that then singer Rod Evans and bassist Nicky Simper were incapable of working in that direction. Both were therefore let go, and Blackmore had them replaced with singer Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover from pop rock group Episode Six. What is now thought of as the classic Deep Purple line-up came to be when keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice came in, this line-up being often labeled as 'MK II' (in contrast to the previous 'MK I' with Evans and Simper). 

The first output of this revamped group was a mixed electric and orchestral album with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, 'Deep Purple in Concert', with the centrepiece being Lord's ""Concerto for Group and Orchestra"". The 1969 release earned some international commercial success despite (or, prehaps, because of) its novetly, reaching #149 on the Billboard 200 chart. The whole project was reputedly initiated after idle chat with the band's manager about the possibility led to him book the orchestra and give the inexperienced composer a deadline to produce the work of a public concert.	 

Following on from this unusual venture were four very influential studio albums over the next four years: 'Deep Purple in Rock', 'Fireball, Machine Head', and 'Who Do We Think We Are?', and the live album 'Made in Japan'. Aside from earning widespread critical acclaim, the band's influence spread as many new hard rock groups looked to their sound. American audiences ate the English group up, with album after album rising up the Billboard 200 chart.
	 
Though this lineup still recorded some songs with a lighter, almost pop-like tone such as ""Strange Kind of Woman"" and ""Black Night"", the influence of their new blood and the impetus this provided to the existing members pushed the band strongly in the direction of heavy rock music. Songs such as ""Speed King"", ""Child in Time"", and the massively popular ""Smoke on the Water"" showed the fiery spirit of the group, with Deep Purple achieving sustained international commercial success.

In 1973, creative tensions led to Gillan and Glover leaving the band, being replaced by previously unknown singer David Coverdale and ex-Trapeze bassist/singer Glenn Hughes. This new lineup continued the success of their predecessors, recording the albums Burn and Stormbringer, and further successful tours and live albums. However, Blackmore became disenchanted with the increasing funk direction he felt the band was taking and left to form Rainbow (a name inspired by the stage set when they performed at the California Jam music festival) with former members of Elf, who had previously toured with Deep Purple as a support act.	 

The band recruited former James Gang guitarist Tommy Bolin and recording Come Taste the Band. It was on the 75/76 tour that the tensions within the band really came to the surface, finishing with their final performance in Liverpool in March 1976, where Coverdale resigned and the band ceased to exist. Tommy Bolin died of a heroin overdose in December 1976 whilst on tour with his solo band.	 

Coverdale went on to form Whitesnake, with Paice and Lord joining Tony Ashton to form the short-lived Paice, Ashton and Lord before they too joined Coverdale in Whitesnake. Hughes completed a solo album but spent most of the 70s and 80s fighting drug addiction which he finally overcome in the 90s and has since produced a string of solo albums.	 

Back again (MK II the 2nd):	 
In 1984, Deep Purple's best-known second lineup (Ian Gillan, Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Roger Glover, and Richie Blackmore) reunited to produce the albums Perfect Strangers and The House of Blue Light. Tensions returned however, and Gillan was fired and replaced by Joe Lynn Turner, formerly of Rainbow. This lineup only lasted for one album, Slaves and Masters, before Ian Gillan returned again for The Battle Rages On. Blackmore subsequently departed the band for good while touring in support of this album, being temporarily replaced by Joe Satriani. During this time, many archival live albums of the original Deep Purple lineup were released, such as Scandinavian Nights (a 1988 release of a 1970 concert) and King Biscuit Flower Hour (a 1995 release of two 1976 concerts)	 

The remaining members recruited Dixie Dregs/Kansas guitarist Steve Morse and, revitalised, produced what many regarded as their best work in many years, Purpendicular, then Abandon before Lord retired and was replaced by former Rainbow and Ozzy Osbourne keyboardist Don Airey. This lineup has since recorded the albums Bananas and Rapture of the Deep.	 

While not as influential or commercially successful as in their original incarnation, the band have remained a successful studio and live act throughout this latest period.

Aretha Franklin,"Aretha Franklin (March 25, 1942) is a Memphis, Tennessee-born but Detroit, Michigan-reared American iconic gospel, soul, and R&B singer. Many have called her ""The Queen Of Soul"" and ""Lady Soul"".

She is renowned for her soul and R&B recordings (on many, of which, she accompanies herself on keyboards and piano -- a skill she learned at an early age, learning to play by ear, according to lifetime friend Smokey Robinson) but is also adept at jazz, rock, blues, pop, and gospel.

She is generally regarded as one of the best vocalists ever by such industry publications/media outlets as Rolling Stone and VH1, due to her phenomenal technical and interpretative talents.

Adept at the piano as well as having a gifted voice, Franklin became a child prodigy. By the age of fourteen, she signed a record deal with Battle Records, where her father Reverend C.L. Franklin recorded his sermons and gospel vocal recordings, and she issued Songs of Faith in 1956.

She is the second most honored female popular singer in Grammy history (after Alison Krauss), having won eighteen competitive Grammys (including an unprecedented eleven for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, eight of them consecutive). The state of Michigan has declared her voice to be a natural wonder.

Franklin is perhaps best-known for her interpretation of Otis Redding's Respect, recorded in 1967 with sisters Carolyn Franklin and Erma Franklin. Many of her songs, however, were originals that have since been covered by other artists. Some of her best-known compositions include (Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You've Been Gone, Ain't No Way, All the King's Horses, Baby, Baby, Baby, Call Me, Dr. Feelgood, Rock Steady, Spirit in the Dark, and Think (which she performed in the film The Blues Brothers). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Aretha+Franklin"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Elliott Smith,"Steven Paul ""Elliott"" Smith (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003) was an American songwriter and musician. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass, drums and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his ""whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery"" and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies.

After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song ""Miss Misery"", included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting, was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1997.

Smith battled with depression, alcoholism and drug addiction for years, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was released posthumously on October 19, 2004.

Early life

Steven Paul Smith was born at Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. His mother, Bunny Welch (née Bunny Kay Berryman), was a music teacher at an elementary school, and his father, Gary Smith, was a University of Nebraska medical student at the time. His parents divorced about a year later, and Smith moved with his mother to live in Duncanville, Texas. Much later in his life, Smith got a tattoo of a map of Texas on his upper arm and said, ""I didn't get it because I like Texas, kinda the opposite. But I won't forget about it although I'm tempted to 'cause I don't like it there."" Smith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie. Smith reflected the impact of this part of his life in the lyrics of ""Some Song"": ""Charlie beat you up week after week, and when you grow up you're going to be a freak."" The name ""Charlie"" also appeared in the lyrics for ""Flowers for Charlie"" and ""No Confidence Man"". The family was a part of the Community of Christ through much of Smith's childhood, but eventually began attending services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him ""really scared of hell"". In a 2001 interview, he stated, ""I don't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it"". At the age of nine, Smith began playing the piano, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father. At this age he also composed an original piano piece, ""Fantasy,"" which won him a prize at an arts festival. Many of the people on his mother's side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer and his grandmother sang in a glee club.

At 14, Smith moved from Texas to Portland, Oregon, to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith first began trying drugs and alcohol with friends as well as experimenting with recording for the first time, borrowing a four-track recorder. During high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and also played guitar, piano and sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction, A Murder of Crows and The Greenhouse, billed as either Steven Smith or ""Johnny Panic"". He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.

After graduation, Steven Smith began calling himself ""Elliott"", saying that he thought ""Steve"" sounded too much like a ""jock"" name, and that ""Steven"" sounded ""too bookish"". Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that it was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates that it was so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey.

Heatmiser

Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science. ""Went straight through in four years,"" he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. ""I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day."" After he graduated he ""worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and legal theory."" While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After graduating from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and Speeder (1994) as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records, and were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album Mic City Sons (1996).

Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to Mic City Sons' release, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser's record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought-out by DreamWorks prior to the release of his album, XO.

Roman Candle

His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith's girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of ""the most recent eight songs that [he’d] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar"" to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was only expecting a deal for a seven-inch record. Regarding the record, Smith said ""I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular. [...] The thing is that album was really well-received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed Heatmiser unfortunately."" Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: ""The idea of playing [my music] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest – Mudhoney and Nirvana – and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off."" The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled ""Kiwi Maddog 20/20"" (a reference to the bum wine MD 20/20), had full band instrumentation.

Smith's debut solo performance was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set comprised of B-sides, Heatmiser tunes, and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, he was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. Several more short tours followed, and Smith helped her record one of his songs ""I Figured You Out"", which he once called ""a stupid pop song [written] in about a minute"" that he discarded for ""[sounding] like the fucking Eagles.""
Elliott Smith and Either/Or

In 1995, the self-titled album Elliott Smith was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a similar style of recording to Roman Candle, but not without hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on ""St. Ides Heaven"", and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on ""Single File"". Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album's pervasive mood gave him ""a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person,"" and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.

In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film Lucky Three: an Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, another Kill Rock Stars release that came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass, drums, keyboards and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, which deals with such themes as existential despair, dread, death and God.

By this time, Smith's already-heavy drinking was now being compounded with use of anti-depressants. At the end of the Either/Or tour, an intervention was staged by close friends of his in Chicago, but it proved ineffective.

Miss Misery and the Oscars

In 1996, Smith was tapped by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film, Good Will Hunting. Smith recorded an orchestral version of ""Between the Bars (Orchestral)"" with acclaimed composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, ""Miss Misery,"" and three other previously released tracks (""No Name #3"", from Roman Candle, and ""Angeles"" and ""Say Yes"", from Either/Or). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for ""Miss Misery"". Not eager to step into the limelight, he only agreed to perform the song at the ceremony after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night — either by him or another musician of their choosing.

On March 5, 1998, Smith made his network television debut on Late Night With Conan O'Brien performing ""Miss Misery"" solo on acoustic guitar. A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars, accompanied by the house orchestra. James Horner and Will Jennings won the award that night for best song with ""My Heart Will Go On"" (sung by Celine Dion) from the film Titanic. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award.

Smith commented on the surrealism of the Oscars experience: ""That's exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn't come to hear me play. I wouldn't want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day.""
XO and Figure 8

In 1998, after the success of Either/Or and ""Miss Misery"", Smith signed to a bigger independent record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, speaking openly of considering suicide, and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, ""Um, yeah – I jumped off a cliff. But it didn't work."" Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released Roman Candle), said about this time in Smith's life: ""I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him."" Smith's first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled XO, it was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins and elaborate string arrangements and even a drum loop on the song ""Independence Day"". His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style was still apparent. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and sold 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith's backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes's ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass, guitar or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed ""Waltz #2."" His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf and Sam Coomes.

In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said: ""...sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they're actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there's a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music."" Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting.

Figure 8, which was released in 2000, featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker, and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England. The album garnered generally positive reviews and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200. The album garnered praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a ""sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures."" However, some reviewers felt that Smith's trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the songs to ""the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary.""

Album art and promotional pictures showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, including television appearances on Late Night With Conan O'Brien and The Late Show With David Letterman. However, Smith's condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the Figure 8 tour.

Final years and recording of From a Basement on the Hill

A follow-up to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned to happen with Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album, when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work up until that point. He later said: ""There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs."" When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer voiced what he believed to be intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell, a member of the band Goldenboy. McConnell told SPIN that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd (of The Flaming Lips) and Scott McPherson played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.

One of the few highlights for Smith in 2001 was inclusion of his song ""Needle in the Hay"" in Wes Anderson's dark comedy The Royal Tenenbaums. The song plays during a suicide attempt. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles' ""Hey Jude"" for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use The Mutato Muzika Orchestra's version of the track instead. Anderson would later say that Smith ""was in a bad state"" at the time.

Smith's live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland's Crystal Ballroom stated concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long; his face was bearded and gaunt; and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of ""memory-loss and butterfingers"". The crowd would often have to shout out the lyrics (and in some cases, guitar chords) when Smith could not think of them.

In the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University's ""A&O Ball"" with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. Smith's performance was described as ""undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician"" and an ""excruciating... nightmare"". A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise made the statement ""...it would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.""

On November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a Flaming Lips/Beck concert. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. Assuming that Smith was homeless, the officers allegedly beat and arrested him and his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith's hand and back were injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith's, stated concern over Smith's appearance and actions, saying that he ""saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn't want in a person. It's not like when you think of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner."" Smith had attempted to go to rehab several times, but said he ""couldn't honestly do the first step... I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it."" In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center: ""What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic."" After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugar and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith's troubles and apparent recovery: ""I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth… He went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on a Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music."" With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with noise music and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba's iMac with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar. Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording ""The California Frown"" (a play on the Beach Boys' ""California Sound""). He said of the songs: ""They're kind of more noisy with the pitch all distorted. Some are more acoustic, but there aren't too many like that. Lately I've just been making up a lot of noise."" He was also in the process of recording songs for the Thumbsucker soundtrack, including Big Star's ""Thirteen"", and Cat Stevens' ""Trouble"". In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition vinyl single for ""Pretty (Ugly Before)"", a song that Smith had been playing since the Figure 8 tour. Steve Hanft described the last six months of Smith's life as being ""like the light at the end of the tunnel"" and was convinced that Smith was clean and recovered.

Death and reactions

Elliott Smith died on October 21, 2003, at age 34 from two stab wounds to the chest. According to girlfriend Jennifer Chiba, with whom he was living at the time, the two were arguing, and she locked herself in the bathroom. Chiba heard him scream, and upon opening the door, saw Smith standing with a kitchen knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called 911. Smith died in the hospital with the time of death listed as 1:36 p.m. While Smith's death was originally reported as a suicide, the official autopsy report released in December 2003 left open the question of possible homicide. A possible suicide note, written on a Post-it, read, ""I'm so sorry—love, Elliott. God forgive me."" According to Pitchfork, producer Larry Crane reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote: ""I hadn't talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I'd like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith's album]. I said yes, of course, and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, 'I don't understand, he was so healthy."" The coroner's report revealed that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in his system at the time of his death. The coroner did find anti-depressant and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications in his system, but at prescribed levels. With his death not being officially declared a suicide, a journalist noted that some have suspected foul play, but also that the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.

Soon after his death, a fan memorial was initiated outside of Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site at which the cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, flowers were brought and photos, candles and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith's songs were left. The owner of Solutions has, as of April 2008, allowed the memorial to stand. Memorial concerts were held in several cities in America and England. A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the Silver Lake area a memorial park in Smith's honor. It received over 10,000 signatures, but no plans to go forth with the park have been announced. Another memorial is located inside Smith's former high school, Lincoln High, and was erected in July 2006.

Since Smith's death, many musical acts have paid him tribute. Songs in tribute to, or about Smith have been released by Rilo Kiley (""Ripchord"" and ""It Just Is"" on More Adventurous), Sparta (""Bombs and Us""), Ben Folds (""Late"" on Songs for Silverman), Third Eye Blind (""Elliott Smith"" on Symphony of Decay), Mary Lorson (""Lonely Boy"" on Realistic), Rhett Miller (""The Believer"" on The Believer), Earlimart (""Heaven Adores You"" on Treble and Tremble), Pete Yorn (""Bandstand in the Sky"" on Nightcrawler, a song jointly dedicated to Jeff Buckley), and Ginger Sling (""Faith"" on the ""Room"" EP). Several tribute albums have been released since his death: To: Elliott From: Portland, Home to Oblivion: Elliott Smith Tribute, Remote Memory: A Tribute to Elliott Smith, A Tribute to Elliott Smith and The String Quartet Tribute to Elliott Smith.

Posthumous releases

From a Basement on the Hill, with almost four years in production, was released October 19, 2004 by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records). With Smith's family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith's ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through and mix the album. Although predicted by Smith to be a double album (or a regular album with a ""bonus disc""), it was released as a 15-track single album. Many of the darkest songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as ""True Love"" (which deals graphically with addiction and rehab), ""Abused"", ""Stickman"" and ""Suicide Machine"" (a reworking of the Figure 8 era unreleased instrumental, ""Tiny Time Machine""). It is rumored that it was the family's wishes not to have these songs on the record, as they had the final say in what should and should not be released. Reviews of the album were mostly very positive, but some were more critical; The Onion's A.V. Club wrote that ""the album he left behind turns out to be messy, complicated, and unquestionably not his defining work...the album still earns its place—not at the top, and unfortunately as a bookend—in a jarringly important body of work."" Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing, a biography by Benjamin Nugent, was rushed to publication and hit stores shortly after From a Basement on the Hill, barely beyond the first anniversary of the musician's death. Smith's family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed and did not support the publication of the book. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and Pete Krebs. The book received mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking that while ""Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith's life, he can offer little meaningful insight"" and that Smith's fans ""will be disappointed by this short and shallow biography.""

On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc compilation album entitled New Moon was released by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label. The songs consisted of demos, early versions, previously released b-sides and some unfinished tracks. In the U.S., the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic's 16th best-reviewed album of 2007. A significant portion of the proceeds from album sales are to go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.

On October 25, 2007, a book titled Elliott Smith was released by Autumn de Wilde, which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics and ""revealing talks with Smith's inner circle"". De Wilde was responsible for the Figure 8 sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at Club Largo in Los Angeles was included in the release.

Musical style and influences

Smith respected and was inspired by many artists and styles, including U2, The Kinks, Elvis Costello, Motown and flamenco records, AC/DC, Scorpions, and Modest Mouse. Smith claimed to listen exclusively to select albums (such as The Marble Index by Nico) for months. Sean Croghan (a former roommate of Smith's and member of bands Jr. High and Crackerbash) said that Smith ""listened almost exclusively to slow jams"" in his senior year at college. Smith was also known to gain inspiration from novels, religion and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially Samuel Beckett, T. S. Eliot, and Fyodor Dostoevsky (and other Russian novelists).

Smith mentioned his admiration for Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: ""My father taught me how to play ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"". I love Dylan's words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words."" Smith covered Dylan's ""When I Paint My Masterpiece"" several times in concert.

Smith was a dedicated fan of The Beatles (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about ""four years old"" and also claimed that hearing The White Album was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith recorded and contributed a cover of the Beatles song ""Because"" to the American Beauty soundtrack, which can be heard during the closing credits of the film. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least one other (""Revolution (Beatles Cover)"", during the sessions for XO), and played many songs by both the band and the members' solo projects at live concerts. 

Regarding his songwriting, Smith said: “The way I think about it is... I don't really think about it in terms of language, I think about it more like shapes. That's an interesting thing to talk about but it's difficult. I'm really into chord changes. That was the thing that I liked when I was a kid. So, I'm not like a... I don't make up 'a riff' really. It's usually like... that sequence that has some implied melody in it or something like that.” Smith said that transitions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more impressionistic music closer to pop rather than folk music. Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to. When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of him writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Meghan Trainor,"Meghan Elizabeth Trainor (born December 22, 1993 in Nantucket, Massachusetts, U.S.) is an American singer, songwriter, and producer. Trainor rose to prominence with her 2014 debut single ""All About That Bass"", which topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks and topped the charts in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

At age 17, Trainor won the worldwide Sonicbids 2011 Tennessee Concerts Song Contest with her song ""You're Good With Me."" She also attended the Durango Songwriter's Expo and Big Al Anderson of NRBQ introduced her to Carla Wallace of Big Yellow Dog Music. Trainor signed as a songwriter with Big Yellow Dog Music shortly after her 18th birthday, while she was still in high school. In 2011, Trainor wrote and self-released two albums, I'll Sing With You and Only 17. She went on several writing trips to Los Angeles, New York City, and Nashville. She settled in Nashville full-time when she was 19. She has had songwriting cuts with Rascal Flatts, Sabrina Carpenter, R5, and many others.

On one of Trainor's writing trips, she met and wrote with Grammy-nominated producer Kevin Kadish. They wrote ""All About That Bass"" in 2014, and her publishing company told her that many artists might be interested in recording the song. L.A. Reid heard Trainor's own demo of the song and signed her to Epic Records, where she was able to release the song as a solo artist. ""All About That Bass"" has since become her first #1 single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, and has topped charts in various other countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark and New Zealand. On September 28, 2014, the UK's Official Charts Company confirmed that ""All About That Bass"" made chart history in the UK by becoming the first act to officially enter the Official Singles Chart Top 40 based on streams alone. The song then remained at the top of the UK chart for four weeks, becoming the longest-running number one by a female act in 2014.

Trainor's debut EP ""Title"", was released in September 2014. It debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number fifteen.It peaked at number seventeen on the Canadian Albums Chart. ""Dear Future Husband"" was originally announced as the second single in an interview with PopJustice; however, in an interview with MTV, Trainor revealed that she had chosen ""Title"" as the second single instead. The song was canceled as a single, but peaked at number 9 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. Meghan Trainor was nominated for an American Music Award in 2014 for New Artist of the Year.

On October 21, 2014, Trainor released the single ""Lips Are Movin"" to contemporary hit radio stations as the lead single from her upcoming third studio album ""Title"", which is set to be released on January 13, 2015.

In late 2014, Trainor announced her first-ever headlining tour That Bass Tour, which is scheduled to begin on February 11, 2015 in Vancouver, Canada and end on March 20, 2015 in Nashville, Tennessee. Trainor's fans have since adopted the collective, ""Megatrons"".

One Direction,"There are two bands under the name One Direction:

1. One Direction is a well known boy band from the United Kingdom and Ireland

2. One Direction is a pop punk band of the United States

1. UK band
One Direction (commonly abbreviated to 1D) is a UK-Irish boy band. The original 5-member group was made up of Liam Payne (born 29 August 1993) from Wolverhampton, Louis Tomlinson (born 24 December 1991) from Doncaster, Niall Horan (born 13th September 1993) from Mullingar, Westmeath, Ireland, Harry Styles, (born 1 February 1994) from Holmes Chapel, Cheshire and Zayn Malik, (born 12 January 1993) from East Bowling, Bradford: Zayn Malik announced he was to leave the band on March 25, 2015, and the remainder of the group confirmed they would continue as a 4-piece band. They applied as solo candidates on the 2010 edition of the X Factor, but the judges, after a suggestion by Simon Cowell, put them in a band in London, UK; therefore qualifying for the Groups category.

One Direction's first single, What Makes You Beautiful, received its first airplay on August 10, 2011 and was released a month later on September 11, 2011. It was the fastest selling single of the year 2011 and peaked at #1 on the UK Singles Chart. The boys released their second single Gotta Be You on November 13th peaking at #3 on the UK Singles Chart. Their album Up All Night followed on November 21st reaching #2 on the UK Albums Chart, narrowly missing out on #1 to Rihanna. When their album Up All Night was released in the USA, it debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts, setting the record for the highest-selling debut album by a British boy band.

Tickets for their first headlining UK tour went on sale October 1st 2011 and all 22 dates sold out within 12 minutes.

Malik Exits One Direction (March 2015)
On March 25th, 2015, Zayn Malik announced he was to leave the band. Commenting on his exit from the band, he said ""My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band"".

A Band Break-(up?) from March 2016
On Aug 23, 2015, The Sun newspaper in the UK reported that the band are to ""take a break"" from March 2016, after they finish promoting their fifth studio album (due for release in Nov 2015). A source said, ""The guys have been together for five years, which is an incredible run for any boy band. They fully deserve to have at least a year to work on their own projects. There is absolutely no bad blood between them and they are all 100% behind the decision. It is definitely not a split and they fully intend to get back together at some time in the future.""

2. US pop punk band

Tears for Fears,"Tears for Fears, named after a phrase found in Arthur Janov's book Prisoners of Pain, is a British pop/rock outfit formed in 1981 in Bath, England. Founder members Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith had been friends since their early teens and had already been in the shortlived ska band Graduate. Initially associated with the new wave and synthesiser bands of the early 1980s, Tears For Fears' earlier work, as evidenced on their 1983 debut album The Hurting , was explicitly based around the emotional angst of adolescence. The album reached number one in the UK and contained three UK Top 5 singles. Orzabal and Smith made their major international breakthrough with their second album, Songs from the Big Chair (1985), which sold over 10 million copies worldwide and topped the US album charts for five weeks (it peaked at #2 in the UK and spent six months in the Top 10). Five singles from the album reached the UK Top 30, with Shout reaching #4, and their highest charting hit, Everybody Wants to Rule the World, reaching #2.  Both singles reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100.

After a lengthy break from the music industry, the band's third album was the jazz/blues/Beatles influenced The Seeds of Love, released in 1989. The album featured American soul singer/pianist Oleta Adams whom the duo had discovered playing in a Kansas hotel bar during their 1985 tour. The Seeds of Love became their second #1 album in the UK, after the title track Sowing the Seeds of Love, had given them another UK and US Top 5 hit. However, after another world tour, Orzabal and Smith had an extremely acrimonious falling out and went their separate ways. The split was ultimately blamed on Orzabal's intricate but frustrating approach to production and Smith's desire to lead the jetset lifestyle now afforded to him which lessened his involvement in the studio. The two spent the next decade working separately.

Orzabal retained the band name and, now working with longterm associate Alan Griffiths, released the 1992 single Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down), which appeared on that year's compilation  Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82-92).  In 1993, Orzabal released the full-length album Elemental, also under the Tears for Fears name, though still effectively him and Griffiths. Another album, Raoul and the Kings of Spain, was released in 1995. Orzabal released Tomcats Screaming Outside, his first album under his own name, in 2001. 

Smith also released a solo album, Soul on Board, in 1993, but this sank without trace in the UK and was not released elsewhere. Finding his own writing partner (Charlton Pettus) in the US where he now lived, he released another album in 1997 under the name Mayfield.

In 2000, routine paperwork obligations led to Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith's first conversation in nearly a decade. The two patched up their differences and decided to work together again. Fourteen new songs were written and recorded, and the ensuing album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, was eventually released in September 2004.

By this time, the band's earlier song Head Over Heels, as well as a cover of Mad World performed by Gary Jules and Michael Andrews, appeared in the 2001 film Donnie Darko, providing the band with some rejuvenation for newer generations. The Jules/Andrews version of ""Mad World"" was released as a single in 2003 and became a UK number 1.

Since the reunion, Tears For Fears has been touring internationally on a semi-regular basis. In April 2010, they joined the reformed 80s pop group Spandau Ballet on their 7-date tour of Australia and New Zealand, before a 4-date headlining tour of their own in South East Asia (Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan) and a 17-date tour of the USA.[14] The band, then, continued to perform small scale tours on an annual basis. In 2011 and 2012, they played dates in the US, Japan, South Korea, Manila and South America.

In May 2013, Smith confirmed that he was writing and recording new Tears for Fears material with Orzabal and Charlton Pettus. 3-4 songs were worked on in the UK at Orzabal’s home studio, Neptune’s Kitchen, in April of 2013. Further work on a new Tears For Fears album commenced in L.A. in July of 2013. According to Orzabal, they have been producing of more dark, dramatic pieces of music, which gave the pending album the tongue-in-cheek working title of Tears for Fears: The Musical. “There’s one track that’s a combination of Portishead and Queen. It’s just crazy,” Orzabal stated.

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the band’s debut album The Hurting, Universal Music are re-releasing it in two Deluxe Editions (one a 2-disc set and the other a 4-disc set with a DVD of the 1983 In My Mind’s Eye concert) in October 2013.

In August 2013, Tears For Fears released their first newly recorded material in nearly decade, with a cover of Arcade Fire’s “Ready to Start” made available on SoundCloud. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tears+for+Fears"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Nicolas Jaar,"Nicolas Jaar is a Chilean-American composer and recording artist based in New York. Nicolas Jaar was born the 10th of January 1990 in New York but spent most of his childhood in Santiago de Chile, only to return to his place of birth as a teenager. Haunted by Mulatu Astatke, Erik Satie, Ezekiel Honig and Villalobos’ “Thé au Harem d’Archimède”; Nico started to make organic electronic music in 2004 at the age of 14.

At 17, he debuted with ""The Student EP"" on Wolf + Lamb Music, with remixes by Seth Troxler and Kasper. At 18 he continued producing and played live at Club der Visionäre and Arena in Berlin, at the Marcy in Brooklyn and at Mutek in Mexico City, alongside Deadbeat, Flying Lotus and Guillaume & the Coutu Dumonts, amongst others. At 19 he studied at Brown University in Rhode Island. Nico has many releases coming up, including some on Circus Company, Wolf + Lamb (with remixes by Ryan Crosson) and on his own label, Clown and Sunset, of which he is the owner and founder.

Jaar then spent four years in underground dance circles, crafting rough, hip hop influenced house music (examples include ""Love you gotta lose again"", ""Angles""). Initially made as jokes to make his mother laugh and dance, Jaar made two songs where he sang in his native Spanish (""Mi Mujer"" and ""El Bandido""). Jaar did not intend for them to come out. He changed his mind in 2010, as he felt the songs were his way of answering to what he deemed as exploitative sampling of Latin American culture by white European DJs.

He released his debut album, Space Is Only Noise, in January 2011 to critical acclaim, receiving a score of 8.4 and the title of Best New Music from Pitchfork [5] and four stars from the Guardian.[6] It was ranked #1 album of the year by Resident Advisor, Mixmag, and Crack Mag.

Jaar toured the album for three years with guitarist Dave Harrington (later of Darkside) and keyboardist Will Epstein. Jaar was voted # 1 Live Act on Resident Advisor for the 3 years he toured the record.[7]

In 2012, he debuted a live concept called From Scratch, where, in front of a live audience, he samples records he bought that day. The first iteration happened in Queens, NY at MOMA PS1; it was a 5-hour concert with collaborator Will Epstein, videographer Ryan Staake, dancer Lizzie Feidelson and singer Sasha Spielberg. He has also performed From Scratch at the Museum of Modern Art in Denver, Colorado and Montreal.

On May 18, 2012 Nicolas Jaar made his BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix' debut,[8] which was voted Radio 1's Essential Mix Of The Year of 2012.[9]

On October 4, 2013, the debut album from Darkside, Jaar's project with longtime collaborator Dave Harrington, was released to critical acclaim and a 9.0 score on Pitchfork.[10] The band toured the record for the entirety of 2014.[11]

In February 2015, Jaar released a largely ambient record entitled Pomegranates, which he intended as an alternate soundtrack to The Color of Pomegranates.[12][13]

Later that year, Jaar scored the soundtrack to Dheepan, a thriller by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard about a family of Sri Lankan refugees living in the suburbs of Paris. It was the winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes 2015.[2]

Jaar is the owner and founder of the New York-based imprint Other People. Notable releases include works by Lydia Lunch, DJ Slugo, William Basinski, Valentin Stip, VTGNIKE, Lucretia Dalt and 12z. Although the label predominantly releases vinyl, it also offers a membership where fans can download new releases and gain access to the entire Other People archive for $4 a month.

Lily Allen,"Lily Rose Beatrice Cooper (née Allen; born 2 May 1985), known professionally as Lily Allen, is an English singer/songwriter, haling from London, United Kingdom and actress. She is the daughter of Keith Allen and film producer Alison Owen. Allen left school when she was 15 and concentrated on improving her performing and compositional skills. She started her musical career in 2002 by signing to London Records. In 2005, she made some of her recordings public on Myspace and the publicity resulted in airplay on BBC Radio 1 and a contract with Regal Recordings.

Her first mainstream single, ""Smile"", reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in July 2006. Her debut record, Alright, Still, was well received, selling over 2.6 million copies worldwide and brought Allen a nomination at the Grammy Awards, BRIT Awards and MTV Video Music Awards. She began hosting her own talk-show, Lily Allen and Friends, on BBC Three.

Her second studio album, It's Not Me, It's You, saw a genre shift, having more of an electropop feel, rather than the ska and reggae influences of the first one. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian ARIA Charts and was well received by critics, noting the singer's musical evolution and maturity. It spawned the hit singles ""The Fear"" and ""Fuck You"", popular mostly in Europe. Allen and Amy Winehouse have been credited with starting a process that led to the media-proclaimed ""year of the women"" in 2009 that saw five female artists making music of ""experimentalism and fearlessness"" nominated for the Mercury Prize. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Allen"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Marina & the Diamonds,
Snow Patrol,"Snow Patrol are an alternative rock band that formed in Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom in 1994 and currently based in Bangor, Northern Ireland, where most of the band members are from. They consist of Gary Lightbody (vocals, guitar), Nathan Connolly (guitar, vocals), Paul Wilson (bass), Tom Simpson (keyboards) and Jonny Quinn (drums). Lightbody and Quinn are the only original members who remain in the band. 

The band became wildly successful on both sides of the Atlantic on the back of their fourth record, 2006's Eyes Open and the ballad ""Chasing Cars"" - a song that has spent a near-record breaking 90 weeks on the UK Top 75. Some of their other well known songs are Run, Spitting Games,  You're All I Have,  Hands Open and  Take Back the City.

The main thing to get about Snow Patrol is that, 14 years after they started out as a student band at Dundee University, they're still flying, gloriously and unpredictably, by the seat of their pants. ""The great and terrifying thing about our band,"" declares their leader and main songwriter Gary Lightbody, ""Is that everything has always happened as it's going along. There's been very little masterplan. We allow things to happen as much by accident as by deliberate intention."" One notable early accident was their name. Lightbody's band used to be known as Polar Bear - hence their 1998 debut album Songs For Polarbears - but were obliged to change it after discovering that this was what the bassist of Jane's Addiction was calling his side project. 'Snow Patrol' had already been chosen for them by a friend who didn't care for the Polar Bear moniker; and so it came to pass that Snow Patrol signed in 1995 to Jeepster, home of their Glaswegian indie heroes at the time, Belle and Sebastian.

Now that the band have become feted as commercial giants - their last album Eyes Open was the UK's best-seller of 2006 - it's worth remembering that Snow Patrol spent the 1990's so broke that at one low point Lightbody had to sell his record collection to pay the rent. Jeepster finally dropped them in 2001 after their second album, the presciently titled  When It's All Over We Still Have To Clear Up , failed to connect beyond their passionate but stubbornly tiny fanbase. ""We spent 10 years making records that 6000 people bought,"" Lightbody confirms. ""Success to us isn't a chart thing, it's when you turn up to play a gig and find the place is full."" In the early days, their largest audiences were back in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, as Bangor-born Lightbody grew up in Northern Ireland before moving to Scotland as a student. ""We're very lucky in that we seem to have three home town audiences in Belfast, Dublin and Glasgow, although we get an extraordinary reception whenever we play anywhere in Ireland or Scotland.""

Snow Patrol began to get considerably bigger all over the UK and in America after signing to Fiction in 2003 and hooking up with the producer Garrett 'Jacknife' Lee. ""An amazing influence,"" in Lightbody's estimation, ""Jacknife has become like an indispensable member of the band. I can't imagine working with any other producer."" Under Lee's inspired guidance, Snow Patrol and their increasingly charismatic vocalist Lightbody, shed some of their indie rough edges and began to hone their pop smarts. In 2003 they released  Final Straw their first number one album, which yielded the band's first top 5 hit,  Run. It also won them the inaugural Ivor Novello for best album in 2004. In 2005 they moved into a remote studio in the middle of Ireland, Grouse Lodge, and completed  Eyes Open, home of one of the most emotionally potent tunes of the 21st century,  Chasing Cars. With over 100,000 radio plays in the UK, 2m downloads in the US, and the accolade of 'Best Song of All Time' from the listeners of Virgin Radio,  Chasing Cars also had the rare distinction of closing the BBC's long running TV chart show Top Of The Pops in July 2006. The effect was phenomenal, leading to Eyes Open selling 4.7m copies worldwide.

At this point most similarly blessed bands would probably have either taken a long, expensive holiday, or re-grouped for another assault on the global pop charts. Lightbody and co did neither, opting instead to call up Jacknife Lee and make an album which took them on an unexpected creative odyssey from Galway in the West Of Ireland, back to Grouse Lodge in County Meath and on to the legendary Hansa studio in Berlin where Bowie and many other luminaries from the 1970's recorded seminal work. In line with the innovative traditions of the studio the album,  A Hundred Million Suns, is Snow Patrol's most ambitious and exhilarating collection so far; and one in which Lightbody feels his band has, accidentally of course, squared its own circle. 

In 2009 Snow Patrol continued their success by touring with U2 and Coldplay

The lead single from Fallen Empires (their sixth studio album released on 11/11/11), was Called Out In The Dark, premiered on Zane Lowe's Radio 1 show on July 21st 2011 and released on September 2nd. (Called Out In The Dark Songfacts). The second single This Isn't Everything You Are was released on October 14th. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Snow+Patrol"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Nickelback,"Nickelback is a rock band which formed in Hanna, Alberta, Canada in 1995. Nickelback is one of the most commercially successful Canadian groups, having sold 30 million records worldwide. Nickelback ranks as the 11th best selling music act of the 2000s, and places as the 2nd best selling foreign act in the US behind The Beatles for the 2000s.

The band consists of Chad Kroeger (vocals, guitar), Ryan Peake (guitar, vocals), Mike Kroeger (bass) and Daniel Adair (drums). The band's original drummer, Brandon Kroeger, left the group in 1997, and was replaced first by Mitch Guidon from 1997 to 1998 and then Ryan Vikedal from 1998 to 2005. The band has released seven albums: ""Curb"" (1996), ""The State"" (1998), ""Silver Side Up"" (2001), ""The Long Road"" (2003), ""All the Right Reasons"", ""Dark Horse"" (2008) and ""Here and Now"" (2011).

The band is now based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Its name originates from the nickel in change that band member Mike Kroeger gave customers at his Starbucks job, he would frequently say, ""Here's your nickel back"".

The band is signed to EMI in Canada and Roadrunner Records for the rest of the world. In July 2008, the band signed with Live Nation for three touring and album cycles, with an option for a fourth cycle. The contract includes recordings, touring, merchandise and other rights.


Early years: 1995–2000

The band was formed in the early 1990s as a cover band called the ""Village Idiots"" by Chad Kroeger, Ryan Peake, Mike Kroeger, and Brandon Kroeger. The band performed covers of songs from Led Zeppelin and Metallica. Nickelback's first release was a seven-track EP called Hesher in 1996. In the same year, Nickelback recorded their first full-length album Curb. ""Fly"" was released on Hesher and Curb and was the first single produced by Nickelback. It did not chart and was only played on local radio stations.

The following album The State was recorded in 1998 and was released as an independent record the same year. Nickelback signed a record deal with EMI and Roadrunner Records. The State was then re-released in 2000 by EMI and Roadrunner Records. Two singles from the album, ""Leader of Men"" and ""Breathe"" were fairly successful and resulted in the album being certificated gold in Canada and the United States. It was certified Platinum in 2008.

Mainstream success: 2001–2007

In 2001, Nickelback released the Silver Side Up album, which propelled them into the mainstream. The single ""How You Remind Me"" was a huge success, peaking at #1 on both the American and Canadian charts at the same time. In the U.S., it was a #1 single on the Mainstream and Modern rock charts, as well as the pop chart. It also peaked at #2 on Adult Top 40. ""How You Remind Me"" became the Billboard Hot 100 #1 single of the year for 2002. The next single was ""Too Bad"", which also hit #1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart and had a small amount of success on the pop chart. The final single from the album was ""Never Again"", another #1 hit on Mainstream Rock.

In 2002, Chad Kroeger collaborated with Josey Scott and Gaige Corvo who played the lead guitar on the Spider-Man theme song, ""Hero."" This also featured Tyler Connolly, Mike Kroeger, Matt Cameron, and Jeremy Taggart.

In 2003, Nickelback released The Long Road. The lead single was ""Someday"" and the album went on to sell five million copies worldwide. The band also released ""Feelin' Way Too Damn Good"" as a single, which peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock Charts. ""Figured You Out"" was also released as a single and topped the Mainstream Rock Charts for 13 consecutive weeks.

Nickelback's fifth studio album, All the Right Reasons, produced five U.S. Hot 100 top 20 singles: ""Photograph"", ""Savin' Me"", ""Far Away"", ""If Everyone Cared"", ""Rockstar"". Three of these became U.S. Hot 100 top 10 singles. All the Right Reasons has sold 7,163,130 copies in the US as of June 13, 2009. In total, All the Right Reasons has sold abut 11 million copies worldwide since its 2005 release. Aside from all the success of All the Right Reasons, lead singer Kroeger began his own label named 604 Records in 2005 and holds the position of executive producer.

Dark Horse 2008-2010

After taking much of 2007 off, the band started recording a new album in earnest. In July 2008, the band signed with Live Nation for three touring and album cycles, with an option for a fourth. 

On September 4, 2008 Roadrunner Records announced that the first single from their upcoming album was originally going to be ""If Today Was Your Last Day"" and was to be released September 30, 2008. However, the song was scrapped as the first single, and ""Gotta Be Somebody"" was the lead single instead. The new album, titled Dark Horse, was released on November 18, 2008. The album was produced by Mutt Lange. Something in Your Mouth was released as the second single to rock radio only on December 15, where it reached #1. ""If Today Was Your Last Day"" was released as the second major single instead. Two more singles have been released,""I'd Come for You"" and ""Burn It to the Ground"".

The album also remained in the top 20 on the Billboard 200 for weeks after its release. The album was certified two times platinum in April 2009, and had by April 2010 sold over 3 million copies in the U.S. However, critical reception of the album has been mostly mixed to negative. In 2009, the band won three Juno Awards for Juno Fan Choice Award, group of the year, and album of the year; the band performed their single ""Something In Your Mouth"" at the ceremony. In 2010, Billboard year end charts listed Dark Horse as the top-selling rock and metal album of the year. The band was also listed at the top selling hard rock artist. On January 29, 2010 they released a Tap-Tap rhythm game for on the App Store, contrary to the band's prior comments against other music related video games such as Guitar Hero. On February 28, 2010, Nickelback gave a performance at the beginning of the concert portion of the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony, performing ""Burn It to the Ground"". On October 2010 Nickelback finished their Dark Horse Tour.

Here and Now 2011-present
Chad Kroeger said in an interview with Billboard.com in September 2010 that songwriting for the next Nickelback album was planned to commence as early as February 2011 with ""about four tunes"" already in mind. Adair mentioned that the band wanted to go back to the musical style of All The Right Reasons, which he described as ""more organic.""

Nickelback announced their new album, Here and Now, on September 8, 2011, along with its two lead singles, ""Bottoms Up"" and ""When We Stand Together"". Kroeger said “We’re four people who love making music, the way we like to make it. We entered the studio this year with a vision, and it all came together. We’re extremely happy with the results, and can’t wait to share them with our fans.” The album was released on November 21, 2011, with the band calling it ""Nickelblack Monday"", a play on Nickelback and Black Monday. Two singles were released to radio stations on September 26, and September 27 for purchase on iTunes.

Here and Now peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 226,714 copies in its first week of release, with Christmas by Michael Bublé taking number one by a margin of only 419 copies

According to an interview with Chad Kroeger, the band planned to release a greatest hits album in 2013 and a new album in 2014. The band officially announced the compilation album The Best of Nickelback Volume 1 through social media on October 3, 2013. Frontman Chad Kroeger had previously stated in an interview that the greatest hits album was to feature songs from previous albums along with new songs but the unveiled track listing ultimately contained only previously released material.

Criticism

In various points in their career, Nickelback has received widespread negative reviews from various sources. Review aggregator Metacritic reports the three of their most recent studio albums since becoming a mainstream act, The Long Road, All the Right Reasons and Dark Horse, to have scores of 62%, 41% and 49% respectively.

They have at times, been ridiculed for their lack of originality. In 2001, Rolling Stone criticised the band's musical style, saying, ""if you're looking for originality, you might want a full refund instead of a Nickelback."" Rolling Stone also said their 2003 release, The Long Road, was ""Brazenly consistent, if unimaginative."" Whilst Allmusic also stated, ""Nickelback can now afford a little more time in the studio and a little more time to indulge themselves, and they turn out the same record, only slicker, which only highlights just how oppressively and needlessly sullen this group is.""

In 2005, Rolling Stone said ""All the Right Reasons is so depressing, you're almost glad Kurt's not around to hear it."" Tiny Mix Tapes also expressed concern over the release; ""Like all Nickelback releases before it, All The Right Reasons was made for all the wrong ones and follows all the formulas and clichés you should be bored to death of by now."" Stephen Thomas Erlewin of Allmusic reviewed Dark Horse, claiming that ""Nickelback are a gnarled, vulgar band reveling in their ignorance of the very notion of taste, lacking either the smarts or savvy to wallow in bad taste so they just get ugly, knocking out knuckle-dragging riffs that seem rarefied in comparison to their thick, boneheaded words.""

Despite a barrage from critics, Nickelback has still managed to please various sources with each of their mainstream albums. Allmusic reviewer Liana Jones complimented Nickelback after their commercial breakthrough, Silver Side Up; ""what gives the group an upper hand over its peers is intensity and raw passion... Nickelback ups the ante by offering realistic storytelling that listeners can relate to."" Following their 2008 album, Dark Horse, ChartAttack credited the band's success to knowing their target audience, ""Chad Kroeger is a genius because he knows exactly what people want and precisely how far he can go. He turned out an extremely racy album that's loaded with songs about gettin' drunk and doin' it all without breaking any taboos, and with enough love and moral authority to grease its passage into the mainstream. Rejoice, North America. This is your world."" Billboard also praised the band; ""The bulletproof Nickelback provides affordable fun that promises good returns in hard times.""

In 2007, USA Today reported that ""few bands inspire such intense hatred as Nickelback."" The article questioned whether Nickelback's commercial success made ""critics wrong"", and published multiple statements from various sources within the music industry. Nathan Brackett, a senior editor at Rolling Stone said, ""There are some bands that, let's face it, are critic-proof"". Both Brackett and Craig Marks, editor in chief of Blender, credit a lot of the band's success to young people who are introduced to them on the radio and ""very casual music fans who don't buy a lot of CDs"". Marks complimented Nickelback's popularity despite the critical response, saying ""it is a tribute to their success.""

Zedd,"Zedd is a Grammy-award winning electro-house DJ and record producer from Kaiserslautern, Germany. Born Anton Zaslavski, he was surrounded by a family of musicians, he began playing the piano at the age of four. After several years of learning to master the piano, Anton began playing the drums in a band, and composed and produced numerous rocksongs in his band's own studio. In 2009 he began producing electronic clubmusic, to much and quick acclaim. After a period of only few months he attained a remarkable level and participated in Beatport's ""Armand Van Helden / Strictly Rhythm Remix Contest"", which he went on to win. This opened up a number of new possibilities for Zedd, and only shortly after, he won his second contest on Beatport, the ""Fatboy Slim / Skint Remix Contest""! This was the foundation for several cooperations with artists such as Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga, P. Diddy, Skrillex, Fatboy Slim, Armand Van Helden and labels like mau5trap, Interscope, Atlantic, Strictly Rhythm or Skint Records. His first release ""The Anthem"" entered the Beatport charts top 20, and even made it to the second place of Track It Down charts. His remix for Skrillex' 'Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites', released on 'mau5trap recordings' climbed up the charts to #4 on Beatport and #2 on Beatport's Electro House charts. Zedd released his single ""Shave It"" on October 4th 2011 via Beatport under Skrillex's new label OWSLA. ""Shave It"" is Zedd's first single with OWSLA. One of the reasons for this rapid development is undoubtedly Zedd's unique and highly recognizable style of composition. It stands out as very detailed and carefully produced Electro House, very playful and the same time remarkably catchy. Zedd is definitely an artist to look out for in the future... <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Zedd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lou Reed,"Lou Reed (March 2, 1942 - October 27, 2013) was an American rock artist originally from Brooklyn, New York, USA. Especially while a member of the The Velvet Underground in the 1960s, Reed broke new ground for the rock genre in several important dimensions, introducing more mature and intellectual themes to what was then considered a largely simplistic genre of music.

In 1964 Reed moved to New York City and began working as an in-house songwriter for Pickwick Records. In 1964 he scored a minor hit with the single ""The Ostrich"", a parody of popular dance songs of the time, which included lines such as ""put your head on the floor and have somebody step on it.""

Reed first found prominence as the guitarist and principal singer-songwriter of The Velvet Underground. The band, which lasted from 1965 until 1973 (with Reed departing in late 1970 after the Loaded sessions), gained relatively little notice during its life but is often considered the seed from which most alternative and underground traditions of rock music sprang. As the Velvet's songwriter, Reed wrote about such taboo subjects as S&M (Venus in Furs), transvestites and transsexuals (Sister Ray, and Lady Godiva's Operation), prostitution (There She Goes Again), and drug addiction (I'm Waiting for the Man, White Light/White Heat, Heroin). 

As a guitarist, he made innovative use of abrasive distortion, volume-driven feedback, and nonstandard tunings. Reed's flat, New York voice, stripped of superficial emotions and, like Bob Dylan's, flaunting its lack of conventional training, was no less important to the music's radical effect. One of rock's most volatile personalities, Reed made inconsistent albums that frustrated critics. The reputation he established more than forty years ago with The Velvet Underground has both haunted and elevated him to near-mythic stature.

Reed began a long and varied solo career in 1972. He scored a hit that year with Walk on the Wild Side off the Bowie-produced Transformer. For more than a decade he then seemed purposely to evade mainstream commercial success.  Transformer was followed by the dark and challenging Berlin, an album that shed his fan base just as he'd cultivated it. 

Albums such as the one-take low-ball wonder Sally Can't Dance and Metal Machine Music continued his nose-thumbing at mainstream success and his label. Metal Machine Music, upon which Reed later commented, ""no one is supposed to be able to do a thing like that and survive."", although considered a contract-fulfilling joke upon its release, has been widely recognized as the invention of ""noise music,"" and many artists, such as Japan's Merzbow have regarded it as a pioneering classic.

Despite his best efforts, the 70's were not without artistically and commercially successful albums. He had a major success with the live Rock 'n Roll AnimalLP, recorded following the release of Transformer, which received vast FM airplay in the mid-to late '70s due in no small part to the superb guitar solos of Steve Hunter. Coney Island Baby contained some of the best written and performed songs in Reed's oeuvre and Street Hassle saw Reed brave new-wave stylings.

Rock and Rule, an animated film centered around rock music in a post - apocalyptic future, featured music by Reed and other similar artists.  His contribution vividly helped define the evil character Mok, and reflected his ongoing exploration of dark subjects.  Although released within a couple of years of another animation cult classic, Heavy Metal, the 1983 release of R&R was a commercial failure.  Despite the advanced animation, lack of marketing support by the parent company doomed it.  The movie was relegated to late - night cable TV, where it built a small but persistent fan base. 

Despite erratic turns, Reed's work won him wide recognition by the late 1980s  as an essential elder statesman of rock. For decades he has written about intense subjects including heroin, transexuals, and S&M - not to mention the horror stories on Berlin - which had never been presented in rock and roll before. The industry had matured, to the extent that his commercial position as an ""art rocker"" was secure.

Reed has lived in New York City for most of his life and much of his music evokes the city, earning the singer comparisons (which he has encouraged) to William Faulkner and James Joyce as writers of regional interest. He also cites the poet Delmore Schwartz as a great influence. Reed studied creative writing under Schwartz at Syracuse University in the early 60s. The song My House tells the story of a Ouija board which spells out Delmore, and how this event inspired Reed.

In May 2000, Reed performed before Pope John Paul II at the Great Jubilee Concert in Rome. In 2000, a new collaboration with Robert Wilson called ""Poe-Try"" was staged at the Thalia Theater in Germany. As with the previous collaboration ""Time Rocker,"" ""Poe-Try"" was also inspired by the works of a 19th century writer: Edgar Allan Poe. Reed became interested in Poe after producer and long-time friend Hal Willner suggested he read some of Poe's text at a Halloween benefit he was curating at St. Ann's Episcopal Church in Brooklyn.[24] For this new collaboration, Reed reworked and even rewrote some of Poe's text as well as included some new songs based on the theme explored in the texts. In 2001, Reed made a cameo appearance in the movie adaptation of Prozac Nation. On October 6, 2001, the New York Times published a Reed poem called Laurie Sadly Listening in which he reflects upon the 9/11 terrorist attacks.[25]

Incorrect reports of Reed's death were broadcast by numerous U.S. radio stations in 2001, caused by a hoax email (purporting to be from Reuters) which said he had died of a drug overdose. In 2003, he released a 2-CD set, The Raven, based on ""Poe-Try."" Besides Reed and his band, the album featured a wide range of actors and musicians including singers David Bowie, Laurie Anderson, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, The Blind Boys of Alabama and Antony Hegarty, saxophonist and long-time idol Ornette Coleman, and actors Elizabeth Ashley, Christopher Walken, Steve Buscemi, Willem Dafoe, Amanda Plummer, Fisher Stevens and Kate Valk. The album consisted of songs written by Reed and spoken-word performances of reworked and rewritten texts of Edgar Allan Poe by the actors, set to electronic music composed by Reed. At the same time a single disc CD version of the albums, focusing on the music, was also released.

Lou Reed teamed up with The Killers on the track Tranquilize for their new compilation album Sawdust, which was released on November 13, 2007.

In December 2006, Reed played a first series of show at St. Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn, based on his 1973 Berlin song cycle. Reed was reunited on stage with guitarist Steve Hunter, who played on the original album as well as on Rock 'n' Roll Animal, as well as joined by singers Antony Hegarty and Sharon Jones, pianist Rupert Christie, a horn and string section and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus. The show was being produced by Bob Ezrin, who also produced the original album, and Hal Willner. The stage was designed by painter Julian Schnabel and a film about protagonist ""Caroline"" directed by his daughter, Lola Schnabel, was being projected to the stage. A live recording of these concerts was also published as a film (directed by Schnabel) which was released spring 2008. The show was also played at the Sydney Festival in January 2007 and throughout Europe during June and July 2007. The album version of the concert, entitled Berlin: Live At St. Ann's Warehouse, was released in 2008.

 On October 1, 2008, Reed joined Richard Barone via projected video on a spoken/sung duet of Reed's ""I'll Be Your Mirror,"" with cellist Jane Scarpantoni, in Barone's FRONTMAN: A Musical Reading at Carnegie Hall.

On October 2 and 3, 2008, he premiered his new group, which later was named Metal Machine Trio, at REDCAT (Walt Disney Concert Hall Complex, Los Angeles). The live recordings of the concerts were released under the title The Creation of the Universe. The Trio features Ulrich Krieger (saxophone) and Sarth Calhoun (electronics), and plays free improvised instrumental music inspired by Reed's 1975 album Metal Machine Music. The music ranges from ambient soundscapes to free rock to contemporary noise. The trio played further shows at New York's Gramercy Theater in April 2009, and appeared as part of Reed's band at the 2009 Lollapalooza, including a ten minute free trio improvisation. At Lollapalooza, held in Chicago's Grant Park, Reed played ""Sweet Jane"" and ""White Light/White Heat"" with Metallica at Madison Square Garden as part of the twenty-fifth anniversary celebration of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on October 30, 2009. Reed's recent activity in films include providing the voice of Maltazard, the villain in the forthcoming Luc Besson animated film, Arthur and the Vengeance of Maltazard, and playing the role of himself in Wim Wenders' movie Palermo Shooting (2008).

In 2009, Reed became an active member of the Jazz Foundation of America (JFA). He was a featured performer at the JFA's annual benefit ""A Great Night in Harlem"" in May 2009.

Reed has remained active doing benefits and composing music. He has contributed vocals on the third Gorillaz album, Plastic Beach, on the song ""Some Kind Of Nature"" and co-wrote and performed backup music for a Chen Style T'ai Chi instructional DVD. He has a co-production credit on Laurie Anderson's Homeland.

Lou Reed performed a cover of the Buddy Holly song ""Peggy Sue"" which is featured on the tribute album Rave On Buddy Holly.

In 2010, French/American underground electronic recording artist, Uffie used an instrumental sample of The Velvet Underground track ""Rock & Roll"" for her debut album's title track ""Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans"", written about her 2009 divorce to André Saraiva. Before the release of the album there was a contract-conflict between Uffie and Lou Reed as to who would be credited as the writer of the title track. The only way Lou Reed would allow her to use the sample was by calling ""Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans"" an ""adaptation"" of ""Rock & Roll"" as well as receiving the sole credit as the songwriter for the track. This dispute once again delayed the album by about six months and Uffie notoriously labeled Lou Reed as ""fucking difficult"" and when asked if he had heard the song, she stated ""yes he has, he had to clear it. And it was a very not nice experience dealing with him, I have to say. I don't know what this guy's problem is but on the credits I think it even says something like he wrote it. He gets everything.""

Reed also began touring with the Metal Machine Trio, which was widely viewed as a return to his exploration of noise and sound. In 2011, heavy metal band Metallica recorded a full length collaboration with Lou Reed entitled Lulu, released November 1 in North America and October 31 everywhere else. After he initially refused Susan Boyle the right to perform ""Perfect Day"" on an American television special (""America's Got Talent""), he subsequently agreed to direct her video rendition.

In January, 2012, Reed and John Cale sued the Andy Warhol Foundation for the license to use the yellow banana image from Warhol's art for The Velvet Underground & Nico album.

Reed contributed vocals to the track ""The Wanderlust"" on Metric's 2012 album Synthetica.

He influenced a large list of artists such as David Bowie, Tom Waits, Ian Hunter, Talking Heads, Julian Thome, R.E.M., Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, Sonic Youth and The Strokes. He died on October 27, 2013. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His debut album, Early in the Morning, was released in February 2010 via Believe Recordings in Ireland. The album's momentum was initially slow, but the use of one of the album's songs on Grey's Anatomy sparked interest in the US and in Europe. The album was released to the rest of the world in March 2011; and charted in the top 30 in Ireland and Norway.

Ludovico Einaudi,"Ludovico Einaudi (born 23 November 1955 in Turin, Italy) is an Italian composer and pianist particularly noted for the use of developing melodious phrases in his piano compositions.

He began his musical training at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan, gaining a diploma in composition. Later, he studied with Luciano Berio. In 1982 he gained a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Festival. He currently resides on a vineyard in the region of Piemonte.

Although Einaudi would prefer not to be labeled as any particular type of composer, he is generally considered a minimalist.

""In general I don't like definitions, but 'minimalist' is a term that means elegance and openness, so I would prefer to be called a minimalist than something else."" - Ludovico Einaudi

Official website: http://www.ludovicoeinaudi.com

(2) Pianist and composer Ludovico Einaudi was born in Turin, November 23, 1955. His mother, also a pianist, would play for him as a young child, planting the seeds for what would become a fruitful, illustrious career. Einaudi studied under Luciano Berio at the Conservatory of Milan, graduating with a diploma in composition. In 1982 his talents would win him a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Festival. The experience opened Einaudi's ears to new ideas like minimalism, world music influences, and aspects of pop music. He spent the next several years composing for the ballet, including Sul Filo d'Orfeo (1984), Time-Out (1988), and The Wild Man (1991). Einaudi turned a corner in 1996 with the release of his first collection of solo performances, entitled Le Onde. This record started Einaudi down the path toward becoming one of Europe's best-selling pianist/composers. 1999's Eden Roc and 2001's I Giorni, both for BMG, captured the solo piano world's attention, both remaining best-sellers for years to come. While seemingly at the top of the composition world, Einaudi ventured into the world of film composition, a journey punctuated by his Best Film Score award in 2002 for his work on Luce Dei Miei Occhi. Einaudi noted in interviews during that period that he missed concertizing, and began performing again regularly. New works blossomed from this effort, including 2004's Una Mattina and 2006's Diario Mali. 2007 welcomed Einaudi's seventh studio album, titled Divenire, where he was accompanied by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. The follow-up, 2009's Nightbook, was much more self-consciously reductionist, featuring solo piano minimally adorned with electronics, and saw Einaudi begin to be appreciated by fans of the ""post-classical"" school that he had arguably, at least in part, inspired. A double-disc best-of, Islands, was released in 2011, and at the beginning of 2013 he signed a new deal with Decca and unveiled the long-gestating In a Time Lapse, which had been recorded in a remote monastery near Verona and saw a return to a more ""classical"" chamber music sound. 2015 brought the release of Elements, which featured violinist Daniel Hope, the Amsterdam Sinfonietta, electronica's Robert Lippok, and Brazilian percussionist Mauro Refosco, among its several guest performers. Recorded at his home studio in Italy, it was inspired by nature, math, science, music, art, and how parts connect to form a whole. ~ Evan C.

LCD Soundsystem,"LCD Soundsystem is the musical project of producer James Murphy, co-founder of dance-punk label DFA Records. Formed in 2001 in New York City, New York, United States, the music of LCD Soundsystem can also be described as a mix of alternative dance and post punk, along with elements of disco and other styles. 

During the band's final years, Murphy was accompanied by Al Doyle (guitar, percussion -- also of Hot Chip), Tyler Pope (!!! / Out Hud) (bass), Nancy Whang (keyboards) and Pat Mahoney (drums). Members that played live with Murphy under the LCD Soundsystem name before this time include Phil Mossman (guitar, percussion) and Phil Skarich (bass).

LCD Soundsystem gained attention with its first single, ""Losing My Edge"". The song, which sounds like the boastings of a music geek put to an electronic beat, received acclaim in 2002. Murphy released a double album simply titled LCD Soundsystem in February of 2005 to critical acclaim. The first disk of the album contains new music and the second contains re-releases of songs previously released as singles. The opening track ""Daft Punk Is Playing At My House"" entered the UK Top 40 in March 2005.

On December 8, 2005 the group received nominations for two Grammys in the Electronica category for their self-titled album and in the Dance category for ""Daft Punk Is Playing At My House"". This album was also chosen as one of Amazon.com's Top 100 Editor's Picks of 2005.

In March 2007, the band released their second album entitled Sound Of Silver. The album has spawned four singles including ""North American Scum"", ""All My Friends"", ""Someone Great"" and ""Time To Get Away"". Sound Of Silver saw a move towards a more traditional song writing approach whilst still maintaining the production values of their eponymous debut effort. This has resulted in the album appearing in numerous critic's end of year lists and another Grammy nomination for best electronic/dance album of 2007.

On November 18, 2008 Al Doyle seemed to suggest in an interview with 6 Music that the band would soon be discontinued. However, the following day both Doyle and James Murphy quashed this rumor, with Murphy indicating a new LCD Soundsystem album was on the way. Murphy began recording in the summer of 2009 in Los Angeles. Possible song titles mentioned at that time included ""Why Do You Hate Music?"" and ""Love in LA."" For the 2009 Record Store Day the band released a cover of Suicide member Alan Vega's song ""Bye Bye Bayou"".

On February 23, 2010, the official LCD Soundsystem website announced that the album had been completed. The first single was set to be ""Drunk Girls"" and on March 25, a stream of the song was put on music site One Thirty BPM. The title of the album and the cover were revealed on the DFA site on March 30. The album, titled This Is Happening, was released in the UK on May 17, 2010 and in the US on May 18, 2010. Prior to the release Murphy promised that it will be ""definitely better than the other two."" Murphy also stated that it was likely to be the last LCD Soundsystem album.

On February 5th, 2011, Murphy announced the band's breakup, citing an interest in pursuing other projects as a record producer. The same day, the band's final performance was announced -- their biggest headlining show ever at New York's Madison Square Garden on April 2nd of 2011. In the show's controversial onsale, the arena sold out in seconds due to scalpers allegedly buying tickets in mass amounts, and denying the opportunity for most fans to buy tickets. After public outrage, the band announced four more shows at New York's Terminal 5, to take place the week before the final show at MSG.

On January 5th, 2016, James announced the band's reunion, a new album to be released 2016, and a tour, ""not just playing coachella. we’re playing all over"".

Pitbull,"There are at least 5 artists called Pitbull:
1) Pitbull is an American rapper from Miami.
2) Pitbull was an American indie rock band from Boston.
3) Pitbull is a Belarusian heavy metal project by Petr Elfimov.
4) Pitbull was a hardcore band from Detroit.
5) Pitbull was an Oi! band from Germany



Armando Christian Pérez (born January 15, 1981 in Miami, Florida), better known by the stage name Pitbull , is a Cuban-American rapper signed to his own label, Mr 305 Inc. The Give Me Everything (Tonight) Songfacts reports that he adopted his canine moniker because, ""They bite to lock. The dog is too stupid to lose. And they're outlawed in Dade County. They're basically everything that I am. It's been a constant fight.""

His first recorded performance was on Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz album Kings of Crunk in 2002, after which he released his debut album, M.I.A.M.I., in 2004. He has since released 2006's El Mariel, 2007's The Boatlift and 2009's Rebelution, which debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200. 

Pitbull's breakout hit was the Lil Jon collabo ""Culo"" produced by Lil Jon & The Diaz Brothers. In addition, Pitbull has also released several mixtapes, the most recent being Unleashed Volume 6, which are mostly composed of freestyles and remixes of popular rap music. Both thematically and musically, the 25-year-old is seen as a modern-day equivalent of earlier Miami rappers such as the 2 Live Crew and Afro-Rican. It was in fact former 2 Live Crew leader Luther Campbell who gave the up and coming rapper his first chance to shine. Apart from Crunk, his album shows clear influences from both Miami bass and freestyle. In addition to his musical work, Pitbull has also been featured in The Source expressing his stance on Dictator Fidel Castro and he was also part of their Unsigned Hype Section. He contributed to an essay published in the New York Post that criticized Che Guevara's iconization in clothing and other areas. In video games, Pitbull's hit single ""Dammit Man"" produced by Jim Jonsin is featured in Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition, and he also plays himself in the upcoming video game based on the 1980's Scarface. His super hit ""Toma"" is featured in WWE Day of Reckoning 2. Also, an album cut, ""Back Up"" produced by The Diaz Brothers, is featured on the EA game Fight Night: Round 2. In late 2005 he re-released ""M.I.A.M.I."" as a separate charting entry, whilst his ""Welcome to the 305"" mixtape was released. In January 2006 he guest-starred in UPN's South Beach. Also in 2006 he recorded ""Nuestro Himno"" in collaboration with Wyclef Jean, Carlos Ponce, and Olga Tañón.

The first single from El Mariel has been released, entitled ""Bojangles"". The album, slated for an October 31st release, will feature guest artists Lil Jon, Ken-Y of Rakim y Ken-Y, Rick Ross, Bun B and the Ying Yang Twins. El Mariel will lead up to Pitbull's 2007 release of an all-Spanish album entitled ""Armando"", which will have an Afro-Cuban feel[1]
 
The cover of Pitbull's 2005 album Money Is Still A Major Issue.Pitbull has a global music publishing deal with BMG Music Publishing.

On the evening of July 31st, 2006, when Cuban Dictator Fidel Castro announced that he was transferring his duties to his brother Raúl Castro, Pitbull jumped into the studio at 11:00PM to write the Ya Se Acabo (which means 'it is over') single. Stating the verse 'hasta luego' (which means 'see you later') during the duration of the song. The song is currently being played widely on Miami radio stations, most noteably Power 96.

Pitbull has contributed much to the Reggaeton music movement. He has worked alongside Zion Y Lennox in the song ""Jump & Spread Out"" featuring Miri Ben-Ari. He also participated in Daddy Yankee's ""Gasolina"" remix featuring N.O.R.E.. He was also featured in Yaga & Mackie Rank's ""Muevete"" hot Reggaeton single, and Elephant Man's ""Rah Rah Medley"" Remix. He appeared in Don Omar's pobre diabla remix and otra noche remix.

Pitbull is also known to appear in various remixes like an alternative remix to Salt Shaker by the Ying Yang Twins, Here We Go by Dirtbag & Timbaland, Promiscuous by Nelly Furtado & Timbaland , and Lovers and Friends by Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz featuring Usher & Ludacris by adding his own verses to the songs. In October 2006, Pitbull hosted a mixtape which featured him in remixes, side by side today's hottest rappers. The Mixtape was created by Blend DJ, DJ ACV. The two worked together in 2005, aswell. The mixtape has since been avaliable for download on the dj's website djknowskillz.com

Her parents, who are ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, had left Prishtina in the 1990s. Among the schools she attended was the Sylvia Young Theatre School. She moved with her family to Kosovo in 2008, the year the country declared its independence from Serbia. At the age of 15, she moved back to London and lived with friends, because she wanted to build a career in music. She began working as a model at age 16. Lipa grew up listening to her father, the Kosovan rock singer Dukagjin Lipa, sing. At the age of 14 she began posting covers of her favourite songs by artists such as Christina Aguilera and Nelly Furtado on YouTube.

Keane,"Keane is an English rock band, first established in Battle, East Sussex, United Kingdom in 1995, taking their current name in 1997. The group is comprised of composer, bassist, and pianist Tim Rice-Oxley, lead vocalist Tom Chaplin and drummer Richard Hughes. Their original line-up included founder and guitarist Dominic Scott, who left in 2001. For their 2008 album ""Perfect Symmetry"" and the following tour, Jesse Quin joined the band on stage to play bass. He also played a large role in recording the album itself, and he subsequently joined the band fully in 2011. 

Keane are known for using a piano as their lead instrument instead of guitars, significantly differentiating them from most rock bands. The inclusion of a distorted piano effect since 2006 and various synthesizers are now a common feature in their music that nowadays combines the pure piano rock sound used during their first album and the alternative rock sound which developed during 2005. Acoustic and power ballads are also a highlight in the group's music and have evolved into many fan favourite songs such as ""On a Day Like Today"" and ""We Might As Well Be Strangers"".

Keane's first two studio albums, Hopes and Fears and Under the Iron Sea, achieved great success in the United Kingdom upon release and very high sales worldwide: their multi-award-winning debut was the best-selling British album of 2004 and their follow-up sold 222,297 copies during its first week on sale in June 2006. 

Their third album, Perfect Symmetry was released on 13th October 2008. First single 'Spiralling' was available for free download, and half a million copies were downloaded worldwide. The album has clear 80s influences, and is compared in Q magazine to both David Bowie's 'Scary Monsters' and The Dandy Warhols' 'Welcome To The Monkey House'. The band have cited Talking Heads as another key influence. This was their first album to include guitar, successfully breaking away from their original set-up.

The Silenced By The Night Songfacts reports that their fourth album, Strangeland will be released from 4 May 2012 through Island Records. First single 'Silenced By The Night' was originally only to be released as a commercial single in the United States, but was released worldwide apart from the United Kingdom on March 13, 2012. The single was finally dropped in Keane's home country April 15, 2012.

Metronomy,"Metronomy is an electropop group which formed in 1999 in Totnes, Devon, United Kingdom, originally as the solo project of Joseph Mount. The project later expanded into a full band, which currently consists of Joseph Mount (vocals, keyboards, guitar), Oscar Cash (keyboards, saxophone, vocals), Gbenga Adelekan (bass, vocals) and Anna Prior (drums, vocals). The band has released five albums: ""Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe)"" (2006), ""Nights Out"" (2008), ""The English Riviera"" (2011), ""Love Letters"" (2014) and ""Summer 08"" (2016).

Metronomy began in the tiny, bohemian market town of Totnes, Devon, when Joseph’s Dad sold his son a computer so he could sit in his bedroom and make electronic music. He was inspired by the likes of Autechre, LFO and Aphex Twin, more as a creative hobby than a pop masterplan.

After decamping to Brighton for Uni, Metronomy released their debut album in June 2006. It was called Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe), and its obtuse but fascinating, largely instrumental electro-pop reflected the eccentricity of its title, and the enduring influence of Totnes.

Joseph admits that he only, finally, saw the commercial possibilities of Metronomy when DJ, producer, Trash founder and electro-punk avatar Erol Alkan began to feature the single You Could Easily Have Me in his sets, and asked Metronomy to play at his club. Cue the need for a proper live show, and the additions of Gabriel Stebbing, Oscar Cash, dance routines and clothes that blink. 

Move on 2 years and Nights Out a wonky love-child of Giorgio Moroder, New Order, Pet Shop Boys and Unfinished Sympathy is a second album that feels like a debut. The first to be vocal-led, with the self-effacing Joseph stepping up and grabbing the mic for most of the tracks; and, crucially, the first to introduce Metronomy as a fully live propsition, rather than a pseudonym for Joseph‘s solo work. 

As Metronomy’s busy touring schedule built a buzz amongst kids who instinctively get the dance/art crossover, In April 2009 the Metronomy show took another leap in its evolution, with the addition for the first time of a live drummer in Anna Prior, and bassist Gbenga Adelekan. The new Metronomy was completely live, proving it is possible for electronic bands to put on show as authentic as any rock band. 

Meanwhile Joseph has embarked on a series of prestigious remixes for the likes of Klaxons, Franz Ferdinand, Gorillaz and collaborations with Kate Nash and Florence and The Machine. Metronomy produced part of the highly acclaimed Roots Manuva album Slime and Reason. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Metronomy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Scorpions,"Scorpions is a rock band from Hannover, Germany that was formed in 1965. Internationally acclaimed for their 1984 rock anthem ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" as well as other popular singles such as ""Big City Nights"", ""No One Like You"", ""Send Me an Angel"", ""Still Loving You"", and ""Wind of Change"", the band has sold over 100 million records worldwide. Along with metal contemporaries such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica, Whitesnake, and others, Scorpions is one of the most successful acts in heavy metal and hard rock in history as well as, by far, the most successful German rock band in the U.K. and the U.S.

Rudolf Schenker, the band's rhythm guitarist, once explained in an interview with Songfacts that: ""In the beginning of our career, we had a problem in Germany because nobody expects a German band to play rock music. With rock music, there are more bands from England or America, which are more exotic than the Scorpions, who are from Germany. But when we went to America in '79, we became the exotic ones. They said, 'Hey, what kind of crazy guys are these?' We were already exotic, with a different view, and we also play our Rock music with a little bit of an ethnic touch. You'll notice that Americans come from the blues side, whereas we come from the classical side, which is different."" 

Formation and early history (1965-1973) 

Young German musician Rudolf Schenker set out to find his way in music in 1965. At first, his group was a school-kid outfit with British invasion influences, featuring Schenker himself on vocals. Things began to come together in 1969 when Schenker's younger brother Michael and vocalist Klaus Meine joined the band. In 1972, the rock group recorded and released their debut album, titled 'Lonesome Crow', with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums. The album showcased a group that still was finding its voice lyrically and in style terms, thus picking up a muted reaction commercially. During the related tour for the album, Scorpions opened for up-and-coming British heavy metal outfit UFO. At the end of the tour, the members of UFO offered Michael Schenker the lead guitar job; the offer proved so tantalizing that he soon accepted. Musician Uli Jon Roth ended up being called in temporarily to finish off the tour. 

The departure of Michael Schenker led to Scorpions as a band going on hiatus. In 1973, Roth, a friend of the Schenker brothers serving in a band called Dawn Road, turned down the role as lead guitarist in Scorpions after Michael Schenker's departure. Yet Roth invited Rudolf Schenker to join his own band instead. With a line-up established of Roth, Schenker, and Francis Buchholz (bass), Achim Kirschning (keyboards), and Jurgen Rosenthal (drums), Dawn Road felt primed for something huge. Roth even managed to get Klaus Meine to join the outfit before too long. Finally, even the ""Scorpions"" name came back as the guys wanted to build on the name's past fame in the German hard rock scene. 
 
Rise to widespread popularity (1974-1978) 

In 1974, the new line-up of Scorpions released an album titled 'Fly to the Rainbow'. The release proved considerably more successful than their former album, with songs such as ""Speedy's Coming"" and the title track establishing the band's shift more and more away from psychedelic rock and towards aggressive, heavy-sounding music. Though sadly possessing what has been regarded as one of the worst album covers of all time, 'Fly to the Rainbow' has additionally earned critical praise over the years. Achim Kirschning decided to leave after the recording came out for other opportunities, but he subsequently guested on keyboards for the next two albums.

+ Soon after, Jürgen Rosenthal had to leave as he was being drafted into the army, and was replaced by a Belgian drummer, Rudy Lenners. He later joined German progressive rock band called Eloy in 1976 and recorded three albums with them. It wasn't until the following year that the band hit their stride with the release of In Trance. In Trance marked the beginning of Scorpions' long collaboration with German producer Dieter Dierks. The album was a huge step forward for Scorpions and firmly established their hard rock formula, while at the same time garnering a substantial fan base, both at home and abroad.  
  +  
  + In 1976, Scorpions released Virgin Killer. The album's cover, which featured a fully nude prepubescent girl, brought the band considerable criticism and was ultimately pulled or replaced in several countries. In spite of the controversy - lead singer Klaus Meine even expressed shock - the album garnered significant praise from critics and fans alike. The following year, Rudy Lenners resigned due to health reasons and was replaced by Herman Rarebell. 
  +  
  + The follow-up to Virgin Killer, Taken by Force, was the first Scorpions record to be aggressively promoted in the United States. The album's single, ""Steamrock Fever"", was added to some of RCA's radio promotional records. Roth was not happy with the label's efforts and the commercial direction the band was taking. Although he performed on the band's Japan tour, he departed to form his own band, Electric Sun prior to the release of the resultant double live album Tokyo Tapes. Tokyo Tapes was released in the US and Europe six months after its Japanese release. By that time in mid 1978, Scorpions recruited new guitarist Matthias Jabs. 
  +  
  + Commercial success and height of popularity (1979-1990) 
  +  
  + Following the addition of Jabs, Scorpions left RCA for Mercury Records to record their next album. Just weeks after being evicted from UFO for his alcohol abuse, Michael Schenker also returned to the group for a short period during the recordings of the album. The result was Lovedrive. Containing such fan favorites as ""Loving You Sunday Morning"", ""Holiday"" and the instrumental ""Coast to Coast"", the ""Scorpions formula"" of hard rock songs mixed in with melodic ballads was firmly cemented. Lovedrive peaked at #55 on the US charts proving that Scorpions were gathering an international following. After the completion and release of the album, the band decided to retain Michael in the band, thus forcing Matthias Jabs to leave. But after a few weeks of the tour, Michael, still coping with alcoholism, kept missing a few gigs and Matthias Jabs was brought back to fill in for him on those occasions when he couldn't perform. In April 1979, during their tour in France, Matthias Jabs was brought in permanently to replace Michael Schenker. 
  +  
  + In 1980, the band released Animal Magnetism, again with a provocative cover showing a girl kneeling in front of a man's crotch. While Animal Magnetism contained classics such as ""The Zoo"" and ""Make It Real"", it was a critical disappointment when compared with Lovedrive.  
  +  
  + The band then began working on their next album. Blackout was released in 1982 and quickly became the band's best selling to date, eventually going platinum. Blackout spawned three hit singles: ""Dynamite,"" ""Blackout"" and ""No One Like You"". 
  +  
  + It was not until 1984 and the release of Love at First Sting that the band finally cemented their status as rock superstars. Propelled by the single ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"", Love at First Sting went up the charts and went double platinum a few months after its release. MTV gave the album's videos ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"", ""Bad Boys Running Wild"", ""Big City Nights"", and the power ballad ""Still Loving You"" significant airtime, greatly contributing to the album's success. 
  +  
  + The band toured extensively behind Love at First Sting and decided to record and release their second live album, World Wide Live. Recorded over a year long period and released at the height of their popularity, the album was another success for the band, peaking at #17 on the charts. 
  +  
  + After their extensive world tours, the band finally returned to the studio to record Savage Amusement. Released in 1988, four years after their previous studio album, Savage Amusement represented a more polished pop sound similar to the style Def Leppard had found success with.  
  +  
  + On the Savage Amusement tour in '88, Scorpions became only the second Western group to play in the Soviet Union (the first being Uriah Heep in December 1987), with a performance in Leningrad. The following year the band returned to perform at the Moscow Music Peace Festival. 
  +  
  + Wishing to distance themselves from the Savage Amusement style, the band separated from their long-time producer and ""Sixth Scorpion,"" Dieter Dierks, ultimately replacing him with Keith Olsen when they returned to the studio in 1990. Crazy World was released that same year and displayed a less polished sound. The album was a hit, propelled in large part by the massive success of the ballad ""Wind of Change"".  
  +  
  + Later days (1991-present) 
  +  
  + After the release of Crazy World Francis Buchholz, the band's long-serving bassist, left the group. Replacing him was Ralph Rieckermann who handled bass duties until 2002.  
  +  
  + In 1993 Scorpions released Face the Heat. For the recording process, Scorpions brought in producer Bruce Fairbairn. The album's sound was more metallic than melodic. Face the Heat was a moderate success. 
  +  
  + In 1995, a new live album, Live Bites, was produced. The disc documented live performances from their Savage Amusement Tour in 1988, all the way through the Face the Heat Tour in 1994. While the album had a much cleaner sound in comparison to their best-selling live album, World Wide Live, it was not as successful. 
  +  
  + Prior to recording their 13th studio album, 1996's Pure Instinct, drummer Herman Rarebell left the band to set up a recording company. Curt Cress and Pitty Hecht took charge of the drumsticks for the album before James Kottak took over permanently.  
  +  
  + 1999 saw the release of Eye II Eye and a significant change in the band's style, mixing in elements of pop and techno. While the album was slickly produced, fans were unsure what to make of the band, responding negatively to almost everything from pop-soul backup singers to the electronic drums present on several songs. The video to the album's first European single, ""To Be No. 1"", featured a Monica Lewinsky lookalike which did little to improve its popularity. 
  +  
  + The following year Scorpions had a fairly successful collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic that resulted in a 10-song album named Moment of Glory. The album went a long way towards rebuilding the band's reputation after the harsh criticism of Eye II Eye.  
  +  
  + In 2001, Scorpions released Acoustica, a live unplugged album featuring acoustic reworkings of the band's biggest hits, plus new tracks. While appreciated by fans, the lack of a new studio album was frustrating to some, and Acoustica did little to return the band to the spotlight. 
  +  
  + In 2004, the band released Unbreakable, an album that was hailed by critics as a long awaited return to form. The album was the heaviest the band had released since Face the Heat, and fans responded well to tracks such as ""New Generation"", ""Love 'em or Leave 'em"" and ""Deep and Dark"". Whether a result of poor promotion by the band's label or the long time between studio releases, Unbreakable received little airplay and did not chart. Scorpions toured extensively behind the album, and played as special guests with Judas Priest during the 2005 British tour. 
  +  
  + In early 2006, Scorpions released the DVD 1 Night in Vienna that included 14 live tracks and a complete rockumentary.  
  +  
  + In May of 2007, Scorpions released Humanity - Hour 1 in Europe. Humanity - Hour 1 became available in the U.S. on August 28, 2007 on New Door Records, entering the Billboard charts at number #63.

Van Morrison,"Sir George Ivan ""Van"" Morrison, OBE (generally known as Van Morrison) (born 31 August 1945) is a Grammy Award-winning artist from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He's a singer, songwriter, author, poet, and multi-instrumentalist, who has been a professional musician since 1958. He plays a variety of instruments, including the guitar, harmonica, keyboards, drums, and saxophone. Featuring his characteristic growl - a unique mix of folk, blues, Irish, scat, and Celtic influences - Morrison is widely considered one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of rock and roll. He has received numerous music awards during his career, including six Grammy Awards (1996–2007); inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (January 1993), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (June 2003), and the Irish Music Hall of Fame (September 1999); and a Brit Award (February 1994).

Known as ""Van the Man"" by his fans, Morrison first rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Northern Irish band Them, writing their 1964 hit ""Gloria"". A few years later, Morrison left the band for a successful solo career, starting with the album Astral Weeks.

Morrison has pursued an idiosyncratic musical path. Much of his music is tightly structured around the conventions of American soul and R&B, such as the popular singles ""Brown Eyed Girl"", ""Moondance"", ""Domino"", and ""Wild Night"". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as his classic album Astral Weeks and lesser known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as ""Celtic Soul,"" and Morrison rejects the characterization of his genre of music as Rock, citing Elvis Presley as a non-influence.

He continues to perform regularly, and achieved his highest U.S. chart position (number ten on the Billboard 200) with his 2008 album, Keep It Simple.   <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Van+Morrison"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Soundgarden,"Soundgarden is a Seattle rock band who helped to define the sound that came to be called grunge. Despite starting years earlier, and having a sound that more closely resembled Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin than their contemporaries, they are considered one of the ""big four"" of the '90s Seattle grunge bands, along with Alice In Chains, Nirvana and Pearl Jam.

The band was formed in 1984 by Chris Cornell (vocals, and originally drums) and Hiro Yamamoto (bass), to be joined later by Kim Thayil (guitar) and Scott Sundquist (drums). Thayil joined the band after moving to Seattle from Illinois with Yamamoto and Bruce Pavitt, who would later start Sub Pop Records. Scott Sundquist, who left in 1986 to concentrate more on his family, was replaced on drums by Matt Cameron. Yamamoto was replaced by Jason Everman on bass after the release of 1989's Louder Than Love. Jason Everman was quickly replaced by Ben Shepherd, who remained with Soundgarden for the rest of its life-span. 

Break-up:
Soundgarden disbanded in 1997, following an aborted tour in support of their album Down on the Upside, as a result of increasing tensions within the group. Cornell went on to pursue a solo career, releasing a solo album, Euphoria Morning. He subsequently went on to form Audioslave with former Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk, while Cameron subsequently joined Pearl Jam, replacing Jack Irons on drums.

The band was named after an outdoor art/sound installation called the ""Sound Garden,"" located on NOAA property near Seattle's Magnuson Park, which makes eerie sounds when the wind blows.

Soundgarden would often utilize alternate tunings and odd time signatures in their songs. Many Soundgarden songs were performed in drop D tuning, including ""Jesus Christ Pose"", ""Outshined"", ""Spoonman"", and ""Black Hole Sun"". The E strings of the instruments were at times tuned lower, such as on ""Rusty Cage"", where the bottom E string is tuned all the way down to B. Some songs use more unorthodox tunings: ""My Wave"" and ""The Day I Tried to Live"" are both in a E-E-B-B-B-E tuning. Soundgarden's use of odd-meter time signatures was varied as well; while such songs as ""Jesus Christ Pose"" are in typical 4/4 time, ""Black Hole Sun alternates between 4/4 and 9/8, ""Outshined"" is in 7/8, ""My Wave"" uses 5/4, ""Never The Machine Forever"" is in 9/8 and ""Spoonman"" alternates between 7/8 and 4/4 sections. Kim Thayil has said the band usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after they had written it, and said that the use of odd meters was ""a total accident.""

Reformation:
On January 1, 2010 Chris Cornell announced through a twitter feed; ""the 12 year break is over & school is back in session"" sealing the fact that all four members of Soundgarden, circa 1997, would be reuniting after a 12 year hiatus.

On April 15, 2010, it was announced that Soundgarden would play its first show since 1997 the following day at the Showbox at the Market in the band's hometown of Seattle. On April 16, an email went out to random Soundgardenworld.com newsletter subscribers with a link to purchase tickets. The show was billed under the pseudonym 'Nudedragons', an anagram for Soundgarden. Tickets sold out in just 15 minutes In addition, a contest was posted on the Soundgarden twitter page, giving one fan a chance to win a ticket to the show.

The Live To Rise Songfacts reports that Soundgarden's first new song in 15 years was debuted via Seattle rock station KISW on April 4, 2012. Live To Rise is a midtempo track that was written by the band specifically for the soundtrack to Marvel's  The Avengers film.

On September 27th, 2012, Soundgarden released ""Been Away Too Long,"" the first single from their new album ""King Animal."" The long awaited album was released on November 13th, 2012.

Ólafur Arnalds,"Born 1986 in the suburban Icelandic town of Mosfellsbær, a few kilometers outside of Reykjavík, composer/performer Ólafur Arnalds has always enjoyed pushing boundaries with both his studio work and live-shows. Since the release of his debut album ""Eulogy for Evolution"" in 2007 he has built up a dedicated international following and is well established for his genre-crossing compositions blending classical, pop and ambient/electronica influences to a unique musical language.

Starting out as drummer for several hardcore/metal bands, Ólafur was asked to write instrumental intros and outros for the album ""Antigone"" of German metal band Heaven Shall Burn. This led to more work in the field of neo-classical strings and piano based music, and ultimately to the release of Eulogy for Evolution and the beginning of Ólafur's partnership with Berlin based label Erased Tapes. In 2008 he embarked on a tour with fellow Icelanders Sigur Rós.

In 2009 he started a week-long project of composing one track by day, making it immediately
available online to his fans. The collection was later officially released under the title Found
Songs. He repeated the same experiment in 2011 under the title Living Room Songs. Also
in 2009 the ballet Dyad 1909 premiered with a score composed by Ólafur. Choreographed
by Wayne McGregor and performed by Wayne McGregor Random Dance, the ballet was
inspired by Ernest Shackleton’s Nimrod Expedition to the South Pole in 1909. That year he also started Kiasmos, together with Janus Rasmussen. Kiasmos is a minimal techno based project. Their self titled debut album was released in 2014, preceded by the Thrown EP.

In April 2010 Ólafur released his second full-length album entitled ...And They Have Escaped
The Weight Of Darkness, which was backed up with an extensive tour, including his first trip
to China.

His third album, and the first to be released under his new partnership with Universal Music's
Mercury Classics imprint, is titled For Now I Am Winter and planned for international release
in February 2013. Expanding on his previous work the new album features a full orchestra
and – for the first time – introduces vocals to his soundworld. Icelandic singer Arnór Dan is to
be heard on four tracks of the album.

More recently Ólafur has been venturing into the world of films, writing his first Hollywood
film score to Another Happy Day. He also had music in the hit film The Hunger Games
and has been featured several times on popular American television show So You
Think You Can Dance. For 2013 his scores include the music to the new ITV thriller
series Broadchurch, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman, as well as to the film Gimme
Shelter, directed by Ron Krauss and starring Vanessa Hudgens and Brendan Fraser.

In 2014 Arnalds won the prestigious BAFTA Television Craft Award for his score to the BBC's hit detective series 'Broadchurch'.

(2) Ólafur Arnalds is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and producer who started as a drummer for a series of metal bands in his native Iceland. His entry into the neo-classical field was somewhat accidental. After German band Heaven Shall Burn heard some solo demo material, they asked him to provide piano-and-string pieces for their 2004 album Antigone. The Erased Tapes label heard the album, was impressed with Arnalds' contributions, and contacted him about recording a full album of material in that vein. The life-cycle concept album Eulogy for Evolution, released in 2007, was the result, with Arnalds -- primarily on piano -- supported by a string quartet. A trio of EPs followed in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, Arnalds provided the scores for the 13-minute short Blinky TM and the feature-length Órói (Jitters), and he also released …And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness, his second proper album. His score for Sam Levinson's Another Happy Day (2011) greatly increased his profile, as he continued to release works like Stare (2012) -- a collaborative EP with Nils Frahm -- and For Now I Am Winter (2013). Later that year, Arnaulds' scored the BBC television series Broadchurch, which produced its own soundtrack. A digital download of the composer's score for Ronald Krauss' film Gimme Shelter was released in February of 2014, followed by a physical release in April. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%C3%93lafur+Arnalds"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Sonic Youth,"Sonic Youth was an influential experimental rock band which formed in New York City, New York, United States in 1981 and are currently on an indefinite hiatus. The last lineup consisted of Thurston Moore (vocals,  guitar), Kim Gordon (vocals, bass, guitar), Lee Ranaldo (vocals and guitar), Steve Shelley (drums) and Mark Ibold (bass).

In their early career, Sonic Youth was associated with the No Wave art and music scene in New York City. Part of the first wave of American noise rock groups, the band carried out their interpretation of the hardcore punk ethos throughout the evolving American underground that focused more on the DIY ethic of the genre rather than its specific sound. As a result, Sonic Youth was pivotal in the rise of the alternative rock movement.

Sonic Youth have expressed a wide variety of influences, ranging from the influential protopunk musician Patti Smith to composer John Cage. The band has been praised for having ""redefined what rock guitar could do"", using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings, and preparing guitars with objects like drumsticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre.

Formation and early history: 1977-1981

Sonic Youth's history began when guitarist Thurston Moore moved to New York City in early 1976. Interested in punk, Moore joined the Coachmen, a guitar-based quartet, after arriving in the city. Lee Ranaldo, an art student at Binghamton University, became a fan of the Coachmen, and he and Moore were soon friends. Ranaldo was a member of Glenn Branca's electric guitar ensemble, touring throughout the United States and Europe. After the breakup of the Coachmen, Moore began jamming with Stanton Miranda, whose band, CKM, featured local artist Kim Gordon.

Moore and Gordon formed a band, appearing under names like Male Bonding and Red Milk before agreeing upon the Arcadians in late 1980. The band played their first show at Noise Fest in June 1981 at New York's White Columns gallery. Branca's ensemble played at the festival. Their performance impressed Moore, who described them as ""the most ferocious guitar band that I had ever seen in my life."" After Branca's set, Moore asked Ranaldo if he wanted to join the Arcadians. Ranaldo accepted; the band played three songs at the festival later in the week without a drummer. Each band member took turns playing the drums, until they met drummer Richard Edson.

Moore soon renamed the band ""Sonic Youth"". The name came from combining the nickname of MC5's Fred ""Sonic"" Smith with the trend of reggae artists, such as Big Youth, featuring the word ""Youth"" in their names. Gordon later recalled that ""as soon as Thurston came up with the name Sonic Youth, a certain sound that was more of what we wanted to do came about.""


Early releases: 1982-1985

Branca signed Sonic Youth as the first act on his record label Neutral Records. In December 1981 the group recorded five songs in a studio in New York's Radio City Music Hall. The material was a released as the Sonic Youth mini-LP that, while largely ignored, was sent to a few key members of the US press that gave it uniformly favorable reviews. After their first record, Edson quit the group for a modestly successful acting career and was replaced by Bob Bert.

During their early days as part of the New York music scene, Sonic Youth formed a friendship with noisy New Yorkers Swans. The bands came to share the same rehearsal space, and Sonic Youth embarked on its first tour, a two-week journey through the southern United States starting in November 1982, supporting Swans. During a second tour with Swans of the Midwest the following month, tensions ran high and Moore constantly criticized Bert's drumming, which he felt wasn't ""in the pocket"". Bert was fired afterwards and replaced by Jim Sclavunos, who played drums on the band's 1983 album Confusion Is Sex. Sonic Youth set up a two-week tour of Europe for the summer of 1983. Sclavunos, however, quit after only a few months. The group asked Bert to rejoin, and he agreed, on the condition that he would not be fired again after the tour's conclusion.

Sonic Youth found themselves well-received in Europe, but the New York press largely ignored the local noise rock scene. Eventually, as the press began to take notice of the genre, Sonic Youth was grouped along with bands like Big Black, the Butthole Surfers and Pussy Galore under the ""pigfuck"" label by Village Voice music critic Robert Christgau. (Christgau saw these bands as sharing an abrasive, noisy and confrontational aesthetic.) Based on this classification, and on a negative live review by Christgau, a feud developed between Moore and the critic, with Moore renaming the song ""Kill Yr Idols"" to ""I Killed Christgau With My Big Fucking Dick"" before the two sorted out their differences amicably.

During another tour of Europe in 1984, Sonic Youth's disastrous London debut (where the band's equipment malfunctioned and Moore consequently destroyed the equipment onstage in frustration) actually resulted in rave reviews in Sounds and the NME. By the time they returned to New York, they were so popular they played shows practically every week. That same year Moore and Gordon were married and Sonic Youth released Bad Moon Rising, a self-described ""Americana"" album that served as a reaction to the state of the nation at the time. The album, recorded by Martin Bisi, was built around transitional pieces that Moore and Ranaldo had come up with in order to take up time onstage while the other guitarist was busy tuning his instrument; as a result there are almost no breaks between the songs on the record, which feature walls of feedback and pounding rhythms. Bad Moon Rising featured an appearance by Lydia Lunch on the album's single ""Death Valley '69"", inspired by the Charles Manson Family murders. In contrast to their abrasive, atonal material of the time, the band considered the song relatively conventional. Due to a falling-out with Branca over disputed royalty payments from their Neutral releases, they were signed to Homestead Records by Gerard Cosloy and by Blast First in the UK (which founder Paul Smith created simply so he could distribute the band's records in Europe). While even the New York press ignored Bad Moon Rising upon its release, now viewing the band as too arty and pretentious, Sonic Youth was becoming quite critically acclaimed in the United Kingdom, where the new album had sold 5,000 copies in just six months.

Claiming he was bored with playing Bad Moon Rising live in its entirety for over a year, Bert quit the group and was replaced by Steve Shelley, formerly of the hardcore group Crucifucks. The band was so impressed with Shelley's drumming after seeing him play live they hired him without an audition. Bert has remained on good terms with the group; he and Shelley both appeared in the music video for ""Death Valley '69"", as Bert performed the drums on the song, but Shelley was the group's drummer when the video was made.


SST and Enigma: 1986-1989

Sonic Youth had a long fascination with influential indie label SST Records. Ranaldo said, ""It was the first record company we were on that we really would have given anything to be on."" Sonic Youth eventually signed to the label in early 1986 and began recording Evol with Martin Bisi in March of that year.

Evol itself represented an evolution of sorts for the band: in addition to increasingly melodic material and the impact of new drummer Shelley's playing, the record also dealt with themes of celebrity, particularly with songs like ""Expressway To Yr Skull"" (called ""a classic"" by Neil Young) and ""Marilyn Moore"". Signing to SST catapulted the band on to a national stage, something that did not happen to their peers in the New York underground. The mainstream music press subsequently began to take notice of the band. Robert Palmer of the The New York Times declared that Sonic Youth was ""making the most startlingly original guitar-based music since Jimi Hendrix"" and even People praised Evol as the ""aural equivalent of a toxic waste dump."" Evol is also notable for a guest appearance by bass guitarist Mike Watt, a friend whom the band coaxed to come to New York after he was deeply depressed by the death of his bandmate, D. Boon.

On 1987's Sister, Sonic Youth continued refining their blend of pop song structures with uncompromising experimentalism. Another loose concept album, Sister is partly inspired by the life and works of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick (the ""sister"" of the title was Dick's fraternal twin, who died shortly after her birth, and whose memory haunted Dick his entire life). Sister sold 60,000 copies and received very positive reviews, becoming the first Sonic Youth album to crack the Top 20 of the Village Voice's Pazz & Jop critics poll.
 
Despite the critical success, the band was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with SST due to concerns about payment and other administrative practices. Sonic Youth decided to release their next record on Enigma Records, which was distributed by Capitol Records and partly owned by EMI. The 1988 double LP Daydream Nation was a critical success that earned Sonic Youth substantial acclaim. The album came in second on the Village Voice Pazz & Jop poll and topped the year-end album lists of the NME, CMJ, and Melody Maker. In 2006, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. The lead single from the album, ""Teen Age Riot"", was the first song from the band to reach significant success, receiving heavy airplay in modern and college rock stations. A number of prominent music periodicals including Rolling Stone hailed Daydream Nation as one of the best albums of the decade and named Sonic Youth as the ""Hot Band"" in its ""Hot"" issue. Unfortunately, distribution problems arose and Daydream Nation was often difficult to find in stores. Moore considered Enigma a ""cheap-jack Mafioso outfit"" and the band began looking for a major label deal.


Major label career and alternative icons: 1990-1999
 
In 1990, Sonic Youth released Goo (their first album for Geffen), which featured the single ""Kool Thing"" on which Chuck D from rap group Public Enemy guested. ""Kool Thing"" became the song that many casual music fans associate with the band; it was later featured in the video game Guitar Hero III and was made available as a paid download for the Rock Band video game. The record is considered much more accessible than their previous work. Their 1991 tour with the then relatively unknown Nirvana was captured in the film 1991: The Year Punk Broke.

In 1992, the band released Dirty on the DGC label. Their influence as tastemakers continued with their discovery of acclaimed skateboard video director Spike Jonze, who they recruited for the video for ""100%"", which also featured skateboarder turned actor Jason Lee. This song, along with the Gordon tune ""JC"" contain lyrical references to the murder of Joe Cole, a friend who worked with the band as a roadie. The album features artwork by Los Angeles-based artist Mike Kelley. In addition, Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise opened on numerous occasions for Sonic Youth in the late 90s. ""Dirty"" features a guest appearance by Ian McKaye (Minor Threat and Fugazi) playing guitar on the track ""Youth Against Fascism"".

In 1994 the band released Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star, their best charting release in the United States, which peaked at #34 on the Billboard 200. The album was filled with low-key melodies and even produced a hit single, ""Bull in the Heather"". Moore and Gordon's daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore was born earlier in the year, and many of the songs from the album were never played live because there was never a full tour to support the album due to Gordon's pregnancy.

The band headlined the 1995 Lollapalooza festival. By that time, alternative rock had gained considerable mainstream attention, and the festival was parodied on The Simpsons 1996 episode ""Homerpalooza"", which featured voiceovers from the band. They also performed the final credits theme for that episode.

Gordon collaborated in Free Kitten, and started a clothing label X-Girl, based in Los Angeles. Ranaldo and Moore have played with many experimental / noise musicians, including William Hooker, Nels Cline, Tom Surgal, Don Dietrich, Christian Marclay and Mission of Burma, among others. Shelley runs the Smells Like Records record label, as well as playing in backing bands for Chan Marshall (Cat Power) and Two Dollar Guitar.

From Sonic Youth's earliest days, Gordon had occasionally played guitar with the group. About the time of A Thousand Leaves and Washing Machine she began playing guitar more frequently, resulting in a three-guitar and drums lineup. These songs were something of a shift for the group's sound, and would lead to the introduction of a fifth member a few years later.

The Washing Machine album started a major shift in the band, away from their punk roots, that working with longer noise-jam sections and included two tracks that showed the new approach in full force - the title track ""Washing Machine"", which is just under 10 minutes long, and ""The Diamond Sea"", which is over 19 minutes long.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the band began releasing a series of highly experimental records on their own Hoboken, New Jersey-based label SYR. The music was mostly instrumental, and the album and track titles and even the liner notes and credits were in different languages: SYR1 was in French, SYR2 in Dutch, SYR3 in Esperanto, SYR5 in Japanese, SYR6 in Lithuanian, SYR7 in Arpitan, and SYR8 in Danish. SYR3 was the first to feature Jim O'Rourke, who went on to become an official band member.

SYR4 was subtitled ""Goodbye, 20th Century"" and featured works by avant-garde classical composers such as John Cage, Yoko Ono, Steve Reich, and Christian Wolff played by Sonic Youth along with several collaborators from the modern avant-garde music scene, such as Christian Marclay, William Winant, Wharton Tiers, Takehisa Kosugi and others. The album received mixed reviews, but some critics praised the group's efforts at popularizing and reinterpreting the composers' works.


Later DGC period: 2000-2006

On July 4, 1999, Sonic Youth's instruments, amps, and gear were stolen in the middle of the night while on tour in Orange, California (see initial post on Usenet). Forced to start from scratch with new instruments, they recorded NYC Ghosts & Flowers and opened for Pearl Jam during the east coast leg of their 2000 tour.

In 2001 Sonic Youth collaborated with French avant-garde singer and poet Brigitte Fontaine in Fontaine's album ""Kékéland"".

When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, several members of the band were blocks away, Jim at their NYC studio (Echo Canyon on Murray Street), and Ranaldo and his wife Leah nearby at home. After the attacks, they curated the first U.S. outing of the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in L.A. The festival was originally scheduled for October 2001, but it was delayed until March the following year due to the attacks.

In the summer of 2002, Murray Street was released; many critics heralded a ""return to form for SY"", seemingly revitalized by the addition of Jim O'Rourke, who became a full member during this period, playing bass guitar, guitar, and occasionally synthesizer. This was followed in 2004 by the release of Sonic Nurse, an album similar in sound and approach to its immediate predecessor that also received positive reviews. ""Pattern Recognition"", a song named after the 2003 William Gibson novel, finds the band once again using Gibson's work for inspiration. The band also showed their pop culture commentary and sense of humor with the track ""Mariah Carey and the Arthur Doyle Hand Cream"", a faster-tempo song sung by Gordon, which spoofed Carey's life, including her short-lived relationship with rapper Eminem, which originally appeared on a 2003 split 7"" with Erase Errata (on the album cover, the reference to ""Mariah Carey"" in the title was replaced by ""Kim Gordon"" due to potential copyright issues. Sonic Nurse had decent sales, in part due to performances on TV talk shows including Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The band was also slated to perform in 2004's Lollapalooza tour along with acts such as The Pixies and The Flaming Lips, but the concert was canceled due to lackluster ticket sales. When the band toured later that year, they played extensively from their 1980s catalog.

On October 6, 2005, Los Angeles CityBeat reported that some of the gear stolen in 1999 was surprisingly recovered and that it might be used for recording of the next album, then tentatively titled Sonic Life. The report also said that Jim O'Rourke might be leaving the band soon; his departure was confirmed by Lee Ranaldo in an interview to Pitchfork Media. In May 2006, the group announced on their website that ex-Pavement member Mark Ibold would play bass for the band on their upcoming tour.

Rather Ripped was released in Europe on June 5, 2006 and in the USA on June 13, 2006. Compared to previous Sonic Youth recordings, the album features many short, conventionally structured, melodic songs and fewer feedback-fuelled left field improvisations (the band's avant-garde tendencies nowadays have been largely exorcised through SYR releases and solo outings rather than band albums). Later that summer, Sonic Youth played the 2006 Bonnaroo Festival, as well as Lollapalooza, promoting the album. In December, Rolling Stone made it their number three Album of the Year 2006.

The band released The Destroyed Room: B-Sides and Rarities in December 2006. It features tracks previously available only on vinyl, limited-release compilations, b-sides to international singles, and some material that had never before been released. This marked the band's final Geffen release.


Independent agents and signing to Matador: 2007–present

In 2008 the band independently re-released Master-Dik for the first time on CD in March exclusively at their online store. They also released two more editions to the SYR, SYR7: J'Accuse Ted Hughes, and SYR8: Andre Sider Af Sonic Youth. SYR7 was released on April 22, and SYR8 was released July 28. On June 10, they also released a compilation album on Starbucks Music, called Hits Are for Squares. The first 15 tracks were selected by other celebrities, and track 16, ""Slow Revolution"", is a new recording by Sonic Youth.

Also in June, the band was the subject of an intensively researched biography, Goodbye 20th Century: A Biography of Sonic Youth written by music journalist David Browne. The book was cited as ""compelling"" (Salon), ""compulsively readable"" (Publishers Weekly), and ""an expressway to the soul of the influential band"" (Vanity Fair). The book featured new interviews with the band as well as nearly 100 friends, family members, and peers. It was published by Da Capo and included over 60 rare photos.

On August 30 2008, the band premiered two new songs at the final McCarren Park Pool show. Thurston Moore stated that in November 2008 the band will start recording a new studio album. The band did not continue their contract with Geffen, being discontent at the way Geffen handled their last four or five albums. On September 8, 2008, it was confirmed by Matador's Matablog that Sonic Youth will release its sixteenth album (titled The Eternal) in spring, 2009, on Matador Records. In December 2008 it was also announced that the group had recently collaborated with John Paul Jones (of Led Zeppelin fame) on a piece that served as the soundtrack for a new Merce Cunningham Dance Company piece. This work was performed by the company on April 16-19, 2009, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in celebration of Cunningham's 90th birthday. On February 12, the band revealed the cover art for The Eternal via their website and blog. The album, produced by John Agnello, was released on June 9, 2009. With the release Matador Records also offered an exclusive live LP only available to those who preordered the album.

On October 14, 2011, Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore announced that they separated after 27 years of marriage through a statement by Matador. The announcement has raised doubts over the future of Sonic Youth after Matador revealed that plans for the band remained ""uncertain,"" despite the fact the band had previously hinted they would record new material later in the year

In a interview on November 28, 2011, Lee Ranaldo said that Sonic Youth are ""ending for a while"". ""I'm feeling optimistic about the future no matter what happens at this point,"" Ranaldo said. ""It was a pretty good tour overall. I mean, there was a little bit of tiptoeing around and some different situations with the travelling – you know, they're not sharing a room any more or anything like that … It remains to be seen at this point what happens. I think they are certainly the last shows for a while and I guess I'd just leave it at that."" Ranaldo also suggest there are no plans for Sonic Youth to record new material. ""There's tons and tons of archival projects and things like that still going on,"" he said. ""I'm just happy right now to let the future take its course.""

Musical style and influences:

Alternative tunings
 
Sonic Youth's sound relies heavily on the use of alternative tunings. Scordatura on stringed instruments has been used for centuries and alternative guitar tunings had been used for decades in blues music, and to a limited degree in rock music (such as with Lou Reed's Ostrich guitar on The Velvet Underground & Nico), but Sonic Youth began using a variety of tunings more radical than nearly anything in rock music history. The tunings were painstakingly developed by Moore and Ranaldo during the band's rehearsals; Moore once reported that the odd tunings were an attempt to introduce new sounds: ""When you're playing in standard tuning all the time ... things sound pretty standard."" Rather than re-tune for every song, Sonic Youth generally use a particular guitar for one or two songs, and can take dozens of instruments on tour. This can be the source of much trouble for the band, as some songs rely on specific guitars that have been uniquely prepared.

Influences

Besides Branca, French avant-gardist Brigitte Fontaine, Patti Smith, Public Image Ltd (PiL) and The Stooges, another influence was 1980s-era hardcore punk; after seeing Minor Threat perform in May 1982, Moore declared them ""the greatest live band I have ever seen"". While recognizing that their own music was very different from hardcore, Moore and Gordon, especially, were impressed by hardcore's speed and intensity, and by the nationwide network of musicians and fans. ""It was great,"" said Moore, ""the whole thing with slam dancing and stage diving, that was far more exciting than pogoing and spitting.... I thought hardcore was very musical and very radical.""

Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo have expressed on numerous occasions their admiration for the music of Joni Mitchell, such as this quote by Thurston Moore: ""Joni Mitchell! I’ve used elements of her songwriting and guitar playing, and no one would ever know about it."" Additionally, Joni Mitchell has always used a number of alternative tunings, as does Sonic Youth. The band named a song after her, ""Hey Joni.""

Members of the band have also maintained relationships with other avant-garde artists from other genres and even other media, drawing influence from the work of John Cage and Henry Cowell. For a 1988 Peel Session, Sonic Youth covered three songs by The Fall and ""Victoria"" by The Kinks, also covered by The Fall. Sonic Youth has featured album art by several well-known avant-garde visual artists, such as Mike Kelley and Gerhard Richter, whose paintings from his ""Candles"" series was used as artwork on Daydream Nation.

Van Halen,"Van Halen is a hard rock band which formed in 1972 in Pasadena, California, United States. The band was originally called Mammoth and changed their name to Van Halen by 1974. The band's first studio album, ""Van Halen"", released in 1978, is widely regarded as a milestone in rock music. With this first release, the band, featuring David Lee Roth on vocals, Michael Anthony on bass, and Dutch-born Edward Van Halen on guitars (and also keyboards later) and brother Alex Van Halen on drums, established itself as a leader in the emerging and commercially successful U.S. heavy metal music genre of the 1980s. In particular, Eddie Van Halen quickly gained widespread notoriety for his technical prowess and musical sensibility. Almost overnight, he was touted as one of the most innovative and influential American rock and roll guitarists.

From 1978 to 1998 the band released 11 studio albums (with David Lee Roth until 1984, Sammy Hagar from 1986 to 1995 and Gary Cherone from 1998 to 1999), all of which broke the Top 20 spot of the Billboard 200 music charts. Their biggest hit, ""Jump"", reached #1 in the United States and Canada in 1984 . The band has sold more than 75 million albums worldwide and has received several Grammy nominations, winning the award with their 1991 album ""For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge"". The video for ""Right Now"" also received several awards, including MTV's Best Video award. Van Halen is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records with the most number one hits on the Billboard Mainstream Rock List. According to the Recording Industry Association of America Van Halen is #19 on the list of Top Selling Artists of all time (having sold more than 56 million albums in the U.S.). Van Halen is one of five rock groups that have had 2 albums sell more than 10 million albums in the U.S. (the others being: Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Eagles and Def Leppard).

In addition to being recognized for their artistic contributions, commercial success and popularity, the band is known for drama surrounding the lead singer spot (in Edward's words, LSD meaning Lead Singer Disease). Although the core instrumentalists and backing vocals have remained constant (Edward, Alex and Mike) until 2004, the band has recorded studio albums with three different lead vocalists: David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar and Gary Cherone. Each vocalist has departed (at least once) under cloudy circumstances. Following their 2004 concert tour the band entered a hiatus phase broken in 2007 with the announcement of a long awaited reunion with David Lee Roth, twenty-two years after the band parted ways with the flamboyant frontman.  The Tattoo Songfacts reports that A Different Kind Of Truth, Van Halen's twelfth studio album, and their first new album with Roth since 1984 will be released on February 7, 2012. 

On March 12, 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame at a ceremony held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. Michael Anthony and Sammy Hagar were the only inductees who attended the ceremony. Michael Anthony made a point of thanking the band's third singer, Gary Cherone, who was not inducted. That night, Velvet Revolver played a medley of two VH songs (mostly ""Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love"" and a small part of the intro to ""Best Of Both Worlds"") to represent the absent members of the band, which was followed by Anthony and Hagar playing ""Why Can't This Be Love"" with Paul Schaffer. Afterwards, at a press conference, Hagar said that he would love to work with Van Halen again. He also said that he hopes the band would do a ""Dave reunion"" with Roth first.

In January, 2007, Edward unveiled a limited edition Frankenstein (his trademark red, black & white striped guitar) replica that's Fender built (only 300 units produced for $25000 each) and later he introduced his own EVH brand.

On May 24, Eddie posted a note to the Van Halen website confirming that he had exited rehab, having cured his ills.

On Monday, July 2, 2007 press reported that the reunion tour with David Lee Roth on vocals is in the planning stage. Then on August 6th, Billboard.com reported that the band had all but finalized a tour, beginning in October. Though the press reaction to the reunion was largely warm due to the band's cheery behaviour at a press conference, the newly re-designed website sparked controversy when Michael Anthony was removed from the album artwork on the Van Halen album (replaced by an image of Wolfgang), and the group photo from the Women and Children First album was taken off entirely. After significant outrage emerged across the internet, the album covers were reverted to their original state without a word.

The tour was originally 25 dates and was scheduled for 2007 only, but popularity has raised it to over 50 concert dates spreading to 2008. When the band released their 2012 album with David Lee Roth, a long North American tour followed.

Present members:
David Lee Roth - lead vocals (1974-1985, 1996, 2000, 2001, 2006-present)
Eddie Van Halen - lead & rhythm guitars, keyboards, backing vocals (1972-present)
Wolfgang Van Halen - bass guitar (2006-Present)
Alex Van Halen - drums (1972-present)

Note: David Lee Roth joined the band twice in 2000, though neither tenure was a success , possibly because of dominant behaviour of DLR.

Former members:
Mark Stone - bass guitar (1972-1974) 
Michael Anthony - bass guitar, backing vocals (1974-2005) 
Sammy Hagar - lead vocals, rhythm & lead guitars (1985-1996, 2003-2005) 
Mitch Malloy - lead vocals (1996, demo work only) 
Gary Cherone - lead vocals (1996-1999) 

Eddie sang lead vocals 1972-1974 while the band was still named Mammoth (before Michael and Dave were added to the lineup); rumour has it that Dave used to rent the PA to the boys and it was cheaper to have him in the band rather than paying for the PA every night they'd play; Mike was the lead singer and bassist from a band named Snake and his talent was welcomed both as a bassist (replacing Stone) as well as a background vocalist.

There were also three failed behind the scenes attempts at a reunion with Roth in the period 2000-2001. In this time Roth 'rejoined' the band, but things fell to bits before the band were confident enough together for public announcements.

Eddie played most of the bass on 1998's Van Halen III album (as well as providing lead vocals on a song), and the three new songs on The Best of Both Worlds. Wolfgang played rhythm guitar with his father and provided backing vocals during the band's 2004 reunion tour at many concerts.

Early in the band's career, they experimented with a keyboard player. Exactly when is unknown, though it seems to have been after the band became Van Halen (so it would have to have been between 1974 and 1978), and not lasted long due to Eddie's dissatisfaction with it.

Today, Van Halen are still on tour (at least until April when they will join golfer Tiger Woods for a benefit performance during ""Tiger Jam XI"" in Las Vegas) with their reunion being one of the most expected of 2007, along with Genesis, The Police and Led Zeppelin. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Van+Halen"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Jennifer Lopez,"Jennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969), popularly nicknamed J.Lo, is a Puerto-Rican American pop and R&B singer, actress, record producer, dancer, model, fashion and perfume designer and film and television producer. She is the richest person of Latin American descent in Hollywood according to Forbes, and the most influential Hispanic entertainer in America according to People en Español’s list of “100 Most Influential Hispanics”.

Starting in 1999, Lopez has released seven albums, including two #1 albums on the Billboard 200 charts and four Billboard Hot 100 #1 singles. She won the 2003 American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and the 2007 American Music Award for Favorite Latin Artist. She has appeared in numerous films and has won ALMA Awards for outstanding actress for her work in Selena, Out of Sight and Angel Eyes. She parlayed her media fame into a fashion line and various perfumes with her celebrity endorsement.

Media attention has also focused on her personal life. She has had high-profile relationships with Ojani Noa, Cris Judd, Sean Combs, Ben Affleck, and Marc Anthony. Her first children, fraternal twins named Max and Emme, were born on February 22, 2008.

Jennifer Lopez was born and grew up in the Bronx to Puerto Rican parents Guadalupe Rodriguez and David Lopez. She has two sisters, Lynda and Leslie.

 Jennifer Lopez financed singing and dancing lessons from the age of 16. After she dropped out of college, Lopez pursued her talent for dance. She split her time between her job at a law office, taking dance classes, and dancing in Manhattan clubs at night. She got her first spot and started out in television as a video girl for rap artist MC Hammer, also a guest spot on the American Music Awards. Her first regular high profile gig was as a “fly girl” dancer on the television comedy program In Living Color in 1990 after being twice rejected. She then left the show after the second season due to friction with another dancer.

 Lopez’s debut album On The 6, a reference to the 6 subway line she used to take growing up in Castle Hill was released on June 1, 1999, and reached the top ten of the Billboard 200. The album featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one lead single, “If You Had My Love” as well as the top ten hit “Waiting for Tonight”. The album also featured a Spanish language, Latin-flavored duet “No Me Ames” with Marc Anthony (who later would become her husband). Though “No Me Ames” never had a commercial release, it reached number one on the U.S. Hot Latin Tracks. On the 6 featured guest artists such as Big Pun and Fat Joe on the track “Feelin’ So Good”, which had moderate success on the Billboard Hot 100. “Let’s Get Loud”, the final single, earned Lopez a Grammy Award nomination in the “Best Dance Recording” category in 2001 Grammy Awards. “Waiting for Tonight” was nominated for the same category the previous year. “No Me Ames” received two nominations at the 2000 Latin Grammy Awards: “Best Pop Duo/Group with Vocal Performance” and “Best Music Video”.

Lopez’s second album, J.Lo, was released on January 23, 2001 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. When her film The Wedding Planner achieved number one shortly after, Lopez become the first actress-singer to have a film and an album at number one in the same week. The lead single, “Love Don’t Cost a Thing”, was her first number-one single in the United Kingdom and took her into the top five on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. She followed it up with “Play” which gave her another top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number three in the UK. Her next two singles were “I’m Real” and “Ain’t It Funny” which were quickly rising up the charts. To capitalize on this, Lopez asked The Inc. Records (then known as Murder Inc.) to remix both songs, which featured rap artists Ja Rule (on both) and Caddillac Tah (on the “Ain’t It Funny” remix). Both remixes reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for several weeks. She re-released J. Lo on her thirty-second birthday with the remix of “I’m Real” as a bonus track. Also, “Si Ya Se Acabó” was released in Spain, due to the success of “Que Ironia”.

Following the success of the re-release of J. Lo, Lopez decided to devote an entire album to the remixing effort, releasing J to tha L-O! The Remixes, on February 5, 2002. This album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming the first remix album in history to debut at the top on the chart. Featured artists on J to tha L-O! The Remixes included P. Diddy, Fat Joe, and 50 Cent and the album included rare dance and hip hop remixes of past singles. It is the third all-time biggest-selling remix album in the world, after Michael Jackson’s Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997) and Madonna’s You Can Dance (1987).

On November 26, 2002, Lopez released her third studio album, This Is Me… Then, which reached number two on the Billboard 200 and spawned four singles: “Jenny from the Block” (featuring Jadakiss and Styles), which reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100; “All I Have” (featuring LL Cool J), which spent multiple weeks at number one; “I’m Glad”; and “Baby I Love U!”. The album included a cover of Carly Simon’s 1978 “You Belong to Me”.

After a year away from the music scene, Lopez released her fourth studio album, Rebirth, on March 1, 2005. Although debuting and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200, the album quickly fell off the charts. It spawned the hit “Get Right”, which reached the top fifteen in the U.S. and became her second Platinum hit (after “If You Had My Love”). “Get Right” was also successful in the UK, becoming her second number-one single there. The second single, “Hold You Down”, which featured Fat Joe, reached number sixty-four on the U.S. Hot 100; it peaked at number six in the UK and ascended to the top twenty in Australia. Another song, “Cherry Pie”, was slated for a release in late 2005, but the plans to make a video were cancelled as the album sales were definitely too weak and the promotion budget exceeded. It was released to radio stations in Spain. Rebirth was certified Platinum in the U.S. by the RIAA. Lopez was then featured on LL Cool J’s single “Control Myself”, which was released on February 1, 2006. It reached number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart. It was Lopez’s first U.S. top ten hit in three years.

Lopez officially released her first full Spanish-language album, called Como Ama Una Mujer, on March 27, 2007 in the U.S. and March 23, 2007 in Europe. Her husband, singer Marc Anthony, produced the album with Estefano, except for “Qué Hiciste”, which Anthony co-produced with Julio Reyes. The album peaked at number ten on the U.S. Billboard 200, number one on the U.S. Top Latin Albums (for four straight weeks), number one on the U.S. Latin Pop Albums (for seven straight weeks) and number one hundred and thirty-one in the UK. The album did well in Europe peaking at number three on the albums chart, mainly due to the big success in countries like Switzerland, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, Greece, Germany, Austria, and Portugal. The lead single, “Qué Hiciste” (Spanish for “What Did You Do”), was officially released to radio stations in January 2007. Since then, it has peaked at eighty-six on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Latin Songs and the Hot Dance Club Play. It also went top ten on the European chart. The video for the song was the first Spanish-language video to peak at number one on MTV’s Total Request Live daily countdown. The second single released is called “Me Haces Falta”. Lopez won an American Music Award as the Favorite Latin Artist in 2007. Como Ama una Mujer according to the United World Chart, it is #3 on the best selling Spanish albums of 2007 and #37 on the best selling albums so far of 2007. Como Ama una Mujer holds the record for the best opening week internet sales for a Spanish album. With Como Ama Una Mujer, Jennifer Lopez is one of the few performers to debut in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 with a Spanish album.

Just over six months later, on October 9, 2007, Lopez released her fifth English studio album (sixth studio album overall), called Brave. She collaborated with producers such as Midi Mafia, J. R. Rotem, Lynn and Wade and Ryan Tedder with Rotem working on some tracks with writing partner Evan ""Kidd"" Bogart. Earlier, on August 26, 2007, ABC premiered a promo for the fourth season of Desperate Housewives, featuring a snippet of the song ""Mile In These Shoes"". ""Do It Well"" was released as the lead single and reached the top 20 in many countries. ""Hold It, Don't Drop It"" was released as the second single in only some countries from Europe.

Billboard Magazine reported, on July 24, 2007, that Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony would ""co-headline"" a worldwide tour called ""Juntos en Concierto"" starting in New Jersey on September 29. Tickets went on sale August 10. The tour was a mix of her current music, older tunes and Spanish music. In a later press release, Lopez announced a detailed itinerary. The tour launched September 28, 2007 at the Mark G. Etess Arena and ended on November 7, 2007 at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. 

At the end of their last concert in Miami on November 7, 2007, Jennifer and Marc proudly announced that they were expecting a child, officially putting to rest the widespread speculation that she was pregnant. Rumors of the pregnancy involving twins soon erupted and were finally confirmed with the birth of twins, Max and Emme in New York on February 22, 2008.

Lopez released ""Louboutins"", a song written and produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart, as the project's lead single in November 2009. However, upon release, the song failed to garner enough airplay to chart, despite topping the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Lopez subsequently left Epic Records in February 2010, citing that she had fulfilled her contractual obligations and now wished to release Love? under a new label.

In June 2010 following the departure of Ellen DeGeneres from American Idol, it was reported that Lopez was in talks to join season ten’s judging panel. During this same time, Lopez and her husband Marc Anthony were being considered for a role on The X Factor for their appeal to Latin and International markets. It was officially announced on September 22, 2010 that Lopez would be joining the tenth season of American Idol. MTV stated that “the deal was mutually beneficial to all those involved”, whilst CNN reported that Lopez was viewing it as a decision to revive her career while Idol producers believe Lopez and Steven Tyler’s appointments will strengthen viewing figures.

Lopez released her seventh studio album, Love? in May 2011. The lead single from the album called ""On the Floor"" was officially released February 8, 2011 and it featured the American rapper Pitbull. The video for On the Floor was premiered on American Idol March 3. Lopez later performed the song on American Idol, including Pitbull. She was dressed in a ""glimmering ensemble"" while the set included lasers and pyrotechnics. The song charted in 27 countries at #1 and it was certified 3x Platinum in the United States. Love? was officially released May 3 and it reached the fifth place in the US Billboard 200. On the Floor is the most viewed video by a female artist in YouTube with almost 550 million views. Lopez also released two other singles from the album, the hip hop jam ""I'm Into You"" which featured the rapper Lil Wayne and the latin influenced ""Papi"".

Lopez returned as judge on the eleventh season of American Idol, reportedly earning $US20 million, compared to the $US12 million she earned last year. Subsequently, Lopez is currently unsure about returning to the show.

Lopez worked with ex-husband Marc Anthony and director-choeographer Jamie King on the talent series ¡Q'Viva! The Chosen, created by Simon Fuller. It follows Lopez, Anthony and King as they travel across 21 countries in Latin America to find new talent. It premiered on January 28, 2012 on Univision and was a ratings hit for the channel.

Jennifer released her first single from her upcoming greatest hits album ""Dance Again"" April 2 and it features Pitbull, who is previously collaborated with J.Lo with ""On the Floor"" and ""Fresh Out The Oven"". The video premiered on American Idol April 5 and she performed a solo version of the hit on American Idol's result show April 10. She was dressed in a skin-tight blue bodysuit and black stockings, surrounded by a dozen back-up dancers.

It was announced on April 30, 2012 that Lopez would be going on a co-headlining tour in the United States with Enrique Iglesias. Lopez has already began her Dance Again World Tour which will continue after her tour with Iglesias. It began in Panama City, Panama on June 14. The Dance Again World Tour will include legs in Asia, Europe and South America.

Lopez is involved in multiple films in 2012. She starred as Holly in What to Expect When You're Expecting. The film was released to theaters on May 18, 2012. Lopez voices Shira in the upcoming animated film, Ice Age: Continental Drift which is the fourth movie in the Ice Age series. Another film which Lopez has shot her parts for, Parker will be released in 2013.

On May 16, 2012, Forbes placed Lopez first on their ""Celebrity 100 List"", in turn naming her the most powerful celebrity in the world for their 2012 edition. She beat out Oprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga for the title, having earned $US52 million from May 2011.

Jennifer's single ""Goin' In"" featuring the rapper Flo Rida will be featured in the new Step Up movie. It was officially released in the United States in June 2012. She performed the song on American Idol's finale and it is also included on her tour setlist.

To celebrate 13 years in music Jennifer will release a greatest hits album which will include, besides her smash hits, new songs. Her upcoming Dance Again... The Hits album will hit stores in July 2012.

In 2014, Lopez released a new album, AKA, which spawned the hit single ""Booty"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jennifer+Lopez"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Ramones,"The Ramones were a punk rock band that formed in Queens, New York, United States, in 1974. They are often cited as the first punk group. Despite achieving only limited commercial success, the band was a major influence on the punk rock movement both in the United States and the United Kingdom.

All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname ""Ramone"", though none of them were related. They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played a farewell concert and disbanded. By a little more than eight years after the breakup, the band's three founding members—lead singer Joey Ramone, guitarist Johnny Ramone, and bassist Dee Dee Ramone—had died. Drummer Tommy Ramone, the last surviving original member, died in 2014.

Their only record with enough U.S. sales to be certified gold was the compilation album Ramones Mania. However, recognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now cited in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the Rolling Stone list of the 50 Greatest Artists of All Time and VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin magazine, trailing only The Beatles. On March 18, 2002, the Ramones—including the three founders and drummers Marky and Tommy Ramone—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2011, the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

Formation: 1974–1975
Forest Hills High School, attended by the four original members of the Ramones

The original members of the band met in and around the middle-class neighborhood of Forest Hills in the New York City borough of Queens. John Cummings and Tamás Erdélyi had both been in a high-school garage band from 1966 to 1967 known as the Tangerine Puppets. They became friends with Douglas Colvin, who had recently moved to the area from Germany, and Jeffry Hyman, who was the initial lead singer of the glam rock band Sniper, founded in 1972.

The Ramones began taking shape in early 1974, when Cummings and Colvin invited Hyman to join them in a band. The initial lineup featured Colvin on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Cummings on lead guitar, and Hyman on drums. Colvin, who soon switched from rhythm guitar to bass, was the first to adopt the name ""Ramone"", calling himself Dee Dee Ramone. He was inspired by Paul McCartney's use of the pseudonym Paul Ramon during his Silver Beatles days. Dee Dee convinced the other members to take on the name and came up with the idea of calling the band the Ramones. Hyman and Cummings became Joey Ramone and Johnny Ramone, respectively.

A friend of the band, Monte A. Melnick (later their tour manager), helped to arrange rehearsal time for them at Manhattan's Performance Studios, where he worked. Johnny's former bandmate Erdélyi was set to become their manager. Soon after the band was formed, Dee Dee realized that he could not sing and play his bass guitar simultaneously; with Erdélyi's encouragement, Joey became the band's new lead singer.
   Dee Dee would continue, however, to count off each song's tempo with his signature rapid-fire shout of ""1-2-3-4!"" Joey soon similarly realized that he could not sing and play drums simultaneously and left the position of drummer. While auditioning prospective replacements, Erdélyi would often take to the drums and demonstrate how to play the songs. It became apparent that he was able to perform the group's music better than anyone else, and he joined the band as Tommy Ramone.

The Ramones played before an audience for the first time on March 30, 1974, at Performance Studios. The songs they played were very fast and very short; most clocked in at under two minutes. Around this time, a new music scene was emerging in New York centered around two clubs in downtown Manhattan—Max's Kansas City and, more famously, CBGB (usually referred to as CBGB's). The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16. Legs McNeil, who cofounded Punk magazine the following year, later described the impact of that performance: ""They were all wearing these black leather jackets. And they counted off this song...and it was just this wall of noise.... They looked so striking. These guys were not hippies. This was something completely new.""

The band swiftly became regulars at the club, playing there seventy-four times by the end of the year. After garnering considerable attention for their performances—which averaged about seventeen minutes from beginning to end—the group was signed to a recording contract in late 1975 by Seymour Stein of Sire Records. Stein's wife, Linda Stein, had seen the band play at CBGB; she would later co-manage them along with Danny Fields. By this time, the Ramones were recognized as leaders of the new scene that was increasingly being referred to as ""punk"". The group's unusual frontman had a lot to do with their impact. As Dee Dee explained, ""All the other singers [in New York] were copying David Johansen [of The New York Dolls], who was copying Mick Jagger.... But Joey was unique, totally unique."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ramones"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Brian Eno,"Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno, (b. 15 May 1948), professionally known as Brian Eno or simply as Eno, is an English musician, composer, record producer, singer, music theorist and visual artist, and is commonly referred to as the father of ambient music. Born in Suffolk, Eno attended art school in Ipswich in the late 1960s, where he studied under Roy Ascott and took inspiration from minimalist painting, cybernetics, and experimental music techniques. Eno has frequently been described as one of popular music's most important and influential figures. A self-described 'non-musician', Eno has helped to pioneer a variety of novel studio production techniques and approaches, playing an important role in the development of ambient, electronic, worldbeat, chance, and generative music styles. He continues to release music, produce, and write, and maintains a regular column in Prospect Magazine.

Eno first came to prominence as the keyboard and synthesizer player and general sonic wizard in the Glam Rock and Art Rock band Roxy Music. After leaving Roxy Music, Eno recorded four highly idiosyncratic and original rock albums, later turning to more abstract sound-scapes on subsequent albums such as 1975's Discreet Music and 1978's Ambient 1: Music for Airports. Since then, he has released dozens of albums (many in collaboration with like-minded musicians, such as Harold Budd and Robert Fripp) which demonstrate his unique approach to music. He has, however, occasionally returned to the pop idioms which were more prominent in his earliest work, including a collaboration with former Velvet Underground member John Cale.

His production credits include some of the most respected albums by Devo, Talking Heads, U2, Laurie Anderson, Paul Simon and Coldplay.

Contrary to popular belief, Brian Eno did not produce David Bowie's popular Berlin Trilogy (Low, Heroes, and Lodger). He performed and co-wrote tracks on all three albums, but they were produced by Tony Visconti. He did, however, co-produce Bowie's 1995 1. Outside. He also produced three of the Talking Heads most acclaimed albums, More Songs About Buildings and Food, Fear of Music and Remain In Light. Talking Heads' front-man David Byrne has worked collaboratively with Eno on the albums My Life in the Bush of Ghosts released in 1981, which has been described as ""[a] pioneering work for countless styles connected to electronics, ambience, and Third World music"", and recently in 2008 on Everything That Happens Will Happen Today, which blends electronic and Gospel music and was released without the use of a record label.

Eno has also pursued several artistic ventures parallel to his music career, including visual art installations, a regular column in the newspaper The Observer and, with artist Peter Schmidt, ""Oblique Strategies"", a deck of cards used in finding various artistic strategies which has been used by Eno since early in his career. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Wiz Khalifa,"Cameron Jibril Thomaz (born September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota), better known by his stage name Wiz Khalifa, is an American rapper based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, signed to Rostrum Records. According to the Black and Yellow Songfacts, his stage name is derived from khalifa, an Arabic word meaning ""successor"", and wisdom. His nickname growing up was ""Wizard"" which was shortened to Wiz when Khalifa was fifteen.

In 2005 he released his first official mixtape, Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania, and later in 2006 he released his first full length street album entitled Show and Prove. Since then he has released a further six mixtapes and a collaboration mixtape titled How Fly with friend Curren$y. He released his debut album, Deal or No Deal, in November of 2009, it reached #1 on the iTunes hip hop chart, and then reached the top ten on iTunes' overall album chart the week it was released. Previously signed to Warner Bros. Records, he left the label in July 2009 after numerous delays in releasing his planned debut album for the label, First Flight. Khalifa stated to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that, ""I learned a lot during my time there and matured as an artist during the process. I'm happy to be moving on with all of my material and having the chance to be in control of my next moves"".He is also the founder of the rap crew Taylor Gang, which includes friends Kev Tha Hustler, Ekko, Smallz Money and Gene Stovall. They derived the name from the fact they always used to wear Chuck Taylor shoes.

Khalifa was born on September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota to a mother and a father serving in the military. The family moved to Pittsburgh when Khalifa was the age of two. His parents' military service caused the family to move on a regular basis. 
Over the next thirteen years, he would move between Pittsburgh and South Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma, Germany, Japan, and England as his parents were reassigned to different posts. In October of 1990 Wiz was separated from his mother,who left him in the hands of her sister while she served in Operation Desert Storm.

During his travels, Wiz was forced to mature quicker than his peers. He was constantly faced with new surroundings, new schools, and new sets of friends, and he found it difficult to become attached to anyone outside his family roots. This nomadic life gave Wiz an opportunity, though, to broaden his mind and offered him many experiences from which to draw inspiration. He began to perceive the world differently than most kids, and he would write his thoughts down every day.These thoughts would become the foundation for his future recordings.

By the age of 14, with a few songs under his belt, Wiz was already drawing comparisons with his commanding voice and witty wordplay. While he has been influenced by artists such as Jay-Z, Camron, and the Notorious B.I.G., Wiz was determined to create his own identity that would, one day, be loved and revered by fans.

Ready to take the next step, Wiz began his search for a recording studio to record new songs. He found one, ID LABS, where owner Eric Dan immediately recognized Wiz's talents. Along with Chad Glick of ID Management, they began to network Wiz to another Pittsburgh native, Benjy Grinberg of Rostrum Records. Benjy realized the raw talent that Wiz possessed, and immediately brought him into the Rostrum family in 2002.

Soon after, Wiz Khalifa began his ascent into the music scene in the Pittsburgh area. He has been hailed by the award winning Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pop music critic, Ed Masley, as having “the skills, the looks, the confidence, the drive, and the charisma for the job.” The New Pittsburgh Courier says, “The combination of a young, charismatic M.C. with a slew of stop-and-rewind rhymes together with a local independent label with major industry connections has set the stage for a hip-hop artist representing Pittsburgh to reach superstar status for the first time ever.

In 2010, with the success of Kush and Orange Juice still present, Wiz Khalifa signed with Atlantic Records. Wiz's style along with his production team, Johnny Juliano, Sledgren, and E. Dan make this a winning combination for success. 

He is also well known for his debut single for Atlantic, ""Black and Yellow"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut album for the label, Rolling Papers, was released on March 29, 2011. He followed that album with O.N.I.F.C. (abbreviated for mainstream markets from ""Only Nigga In First Class"") on December 4, 2012 which was backed by the singles ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" and ""Remember You"". O.N.I.F.C. debuted at number two with 131,000 in first week sales.

In April 2013, Khalifa revealed that after having his son he decided to work on a new album that he was planning to release in 2013. On April 17, 2013, Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y announced that they will drop their collaboration EP Live in Concert on April 20, 2013. The EP featured seven new songs. On June 24, 2013, he announced that his fifth studio album would be titled Blacc Hollywood and would be released in 2013. On September 3, 2013, Khalifa revealed he had recorded songs with Miley Cyrus, Adele and Juicy J for Blacc Hollywood. In October 2013, Mannie Fresh confirmed that he provided production for the album. On February 11, 2014, Khalifa released Blacc Hollywood's first single titled ""We Dem Boyz"". The album was then supported by the singles ""KK"", ""You and Your Friends"", ""Stayin Out All Night"", ""Promises"" and ""So High"". 

Khalifa released an EP with TY Dolla $ign on March 31, 2015, entitled ""Talk About It In the Morning"". That same month, Wiz released the lead single for the film ""Furious 7"" called ""See You Again"" as a tribute to Paul Walker. The single has since gone on to global success. ""See You Again"" spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, tying for the longest-running rap number-one hit in the US.

Paul Simon,"Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941 in Newark, New Jersey) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. He first gained world-wide recognition as the writing talent behind the popular American folk-rock duo Simon & Garfunkel formed with fellow musician Art Garfunkel. When Simon & Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon quickly began his solo career with the release of the self-titled album, Paul Simon. This was followed by There Goes Rhymin' Simon and Still Crazy After All These Years, both of which featured chart-topping hits such as Loves Me Like A Rock and Kodachrome. In 1986 Simon released the immensely popular Graceland, which featured the groundbreaking use of African rhythms and performers Ladysmith Black Mambazo. In 1990, he followed up Graceland with the successor album The Rhythm of the Saints which featured Brazilian and Cajun musical themes. These albums helped to popularize world music as a genre.

He co-wrote the unsuccessful, but critically-acclaimed musical The Capeman with Nobel-winning poet Derek Walcott in 1997. His most recent album, Surprise, was produced by Brian Eno.

Paul Simon still tours occasionally, both as a solo artist and with his old musical partner Art Garfunkel. He is married to Edie Brickell. 

In 1994 Paul Simon held 14 sold out concerts in Nantes (France) with International professional fusion players: Nino Manore (Italy), Francis Mc Gowan (UK), Gissele Masarde (France), Nikša Sviličić (Croatia), and others. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 – March 9,  1997), also known as Biggie Smalls (after a stylish gangster in 1975’s Let’s Do it Again) and Frank White (from the film King of New York), but best known as The Notorious B.I.G. (Business Instead of Game and, since his death, Books Instead of Guns), was a popular Brooklyn-born rapper of the mid-1990s.

His career was overshadowed by the Bad Boy/Death Row Records feud during his life, but following his untimely death in 1997, The Notorious B.I.G. has been celebrated as a hip-hop legend. He is remembered for his storytelling ability, talented freestyling ability, and his easy to understand yet complex flow. The Notorious B.I.G. is considered by many to be one of the greatest rappers of all time.

Early Life

Christopher Wallace was born in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, New York. His father, George Latore, left the family shortly after his birth, and his mother, Voletta, was a schoolteacher. While he is known to have dropped out of school and become a drug dealer, his mother has claimed that the family was not poor and that Wallace exaggerated his childhood situation in his lyrics. His best childhood friend and inspiration was a chubby kid who went by the name of Lil Punisha.

Wallace, who originally didn’t stray much farther than his Brooklyn neighborhood to sell drugs, began to traffic drugs to Virginia and Maryland where it was sold at a higher price. He was eventually busted, and served 10 months in jail. Shortly after he was released, he had his first child, T’Yanna.

With a baby on the way, Wallace decided to start rapping. He developed into a talented lyricist, recording a demo tape with local performer Mr. Cee, who was the DJ for Brooklyn MC Big Daddy Kane. This tape reached The Source magazine and they co-signed Biggie in their “Unsigned Hype” column, which is dedicated to aspiring rappers.

Rap career

The demo tape found its way into the hands of then Uptown Records employee Sean “Puffy” Combs (now Diddy, who subsequently arranged for a meeting with Wallace. Combs and Wallace became instant friends, performing together on the 1992 reggae song “Dolly My Babii” by Super Cat.

Wallace first gained notice with “Party and Bullshit,” his first single. He made his second mainstream appearance on the remix of Mary J. Blige’s smash hits “Real Love” and “What’s the 411”. He also appeared on the “Flava in ya Ear” remix. He appeared on the album One Million Strong on a song called “RUNNIN’” with 2Pac & Dramacydal. He also made an appearance on the Trapp album Stop The Gunfight on a track called “Be The Realist” with 2Pac & Trapp. This album also contained a remix of “RUNNIN’” called “Stop The Gunfight.” All of these guest appearances built a sizeable buzz around Wallace’s name leading up to his solo debut.

In 1994, he released “Juicy”, his first mainstream single. He also released Ready to Die, his debut album, which is regarded as one of hip-hop’s all-time classics and credited with revitalizing East Coast hip hop. The album features one of rap’s most famous “playa anthems,” “Big Poppa,” which samples the The Isley Brothers. Wallace’s album drew critical acclaim for its vivid story-telling and razor-sharp lyricism, an example being the line “They don’t know about the stress filled day/Baby on the way, mad bills to pay/That’s why you drink Tanqueray/So you can reminisce and wish/You wasn’t living so devilish” from “Everyday Struggle.”

In 1995, Wallace’s protegés, Junior M.A.F.I.A. (Junior Masters At Finding Intelligent Attitudes), released the album Conspiracy. That same year, Wallace introduced to the mainstream his crewmates Lil’ Kim and Lil’ Cease. His single “One More Chance” debuted at #5 on the pop charts, tying “Scream/Childhood” by Michael Jackson as the highest debut single in music history at the time, although this record has since been surpassed by Jackson’s “You Are Not Alone,” which debuted at number one. “One More Chance,” which sampled the R&B song “Stay With Me,” was a remix of the song by the same name that originally appeared on Ready to Die. “One More Chance” was also his highest selling single, going Platinum in a matter of weeks.

Also in 1995, Wallace featured in Michael Jackson’s song “This Time Around”, which can be found on Jackson’s HIStory album. This was not the only Michael Jackson song in which Wallace featured in. In 2001, Jackson included a rap verse sung by Wallace in his song “Unbreakable”, which is found on Jackson’s “Invincible” album.

By the end of 1995, Wallace had become one of the most famous and popular rappers in the world. He was named “Lyricist Of The Year” by The Source, and many dubbed him the “King Of New York” (a play on his “Frank White” persona.)

Technique

Big was notorized early in his career mostly for his lyrical content, which included hardcore gangsta-rap lyrics at a time when that style dominated the West Coast, and most of his native New York was dominated by the jazziness of A Tribe Called Quest and Gang Starr and the blend of Five Percenter/far East-influenced/gangsta stylings of MCs like Afu-Ra, Jeru the Damaja and the Wu-Tang Clan.

Over the course of his career, fans who called him the greatest would cite his flow, topical diversity, and vivid, detailed storytelling; he also moved from simple thug lyrics to mafioso-like tales of “gangsterism”, a posturing which some speculate probably contributed to his death.

East Coast West Coast Feud

Although Ready to Die made Wallace a star, he is most famed for his involvement in rap’s infamous feud between the East and West Coast scenes. Before Ready to Die was released, he began to associate with rap superstar Tupac Shakur, a New York City native who moved to Baltimore and later Marin City. The two recorded a number of songs together, and Wallace even performed alongside Shakur in a now-famous Madison Square Garden freestyle in 1994. However, their friendship ended when Shakur was shot in November of that year. Though there is no evidence suggesting it, Shakur claimed that Combs and Wallace knew about the shooting beforehand based on their behavior that night and what he had heard from his sources. He also thought that the lyrics in Biggie’s “Who Shot Ya,” were disrespectful and shouldn’t have been released at such a time. Shakur subsequently joined Death Row Records after his release from prison in late 1995.

Death Row Records and Bad Boy Entertainment were the two most successful labels of the 1990s, and with the two biggest stars in rap now associated with different labels, the feud escalated. In 1996, Tupac recorded a song called “Hit ‘Em Up”, in which he claims to have slept with B.I.G.’s wife Faith Evans, and claims that Biggie copied his style. Biggie never made a response, and the two even met before the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards. However, when Shakur was killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, rumors of Wallace’s possible involvement in the murder cropped up almost immediately. He denied the allegations. Also around this time, he was involved in a car accident that shattered his leg and would force him to use a cane for the rest of his life.

Death

On March 9, 1997, Wallace was shot and killed in Los Angeles, where he had been attending a party by VIBE Magazine near the Petersen Automotive Museum. As his car pulled up to a red light, another car opened fire, hitting him six times and killing him almost instantly.

His murder has never been conclusively solved, though theories abound as to the motives and identities of the murderers. Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight and the Mob Piru Bloods gang with whom he associated are among the prime suspects for involvement. In his book, LAbyrinth, LAPD officer Russell Poole probes the circumstances and figures involved in the shootings.

Funeral

Biggie’s death was a vicious shock to the entire music industry and sent shock waves around the world. The Notorious B.I.G.’s public funeral, however, was anything but peaceful. Wallace was loved in his neighbourhood, his funeral was a massive event. Thousands flooded into his Brooklyn neighborhood to catch a glimpse of his hearse, jumping on cars and clashing with police; ten people were arrested. When someone put on “Hypnotize”, the whole crowd erupted.

Theories about his death

Director Nick Broomfield and co-producer Dmitri Leybman have released an investigative documentary called Biggie & Tupac which implicates the LAPD and Suge Knight. Proponents of this theory defend it because the LAPD’s elite robbery and homicide unit didn’t begin to investigate Wallace’s murder until a month after it happened, and the job was given to a poorly funded division of LAPD investigators; and several prison inmates who were once members of the Mob Piru Bloods have come forward and said that they know for a fact that Suge Knight ordered Wallace’s murder due to their own personal connections.

Conspiracy theories abound about Wallace’s murder: Some believe that the Crips gang may have shot Wallace in retalliation for his not paying for the security services they provided at a previous party. However, it should be noted that such theories are simply speculation, with no hard evidence backing them up.

The Los Angeles Times ran an almost universally discredited article entitled “Who Shot Tupac Shakur?” by reporter Chuck Phillips, which concludes that Wallace was ultimately behind Shakur’s murder. Evidence to the contrary has since surfaced, most notably a dated and timed excerpt from a recording that Wallace made in a studio in New York when he was supposedly providing the murder weapon to hitmen in Las Vegas. The article also claims that he checked in and out of a hotel without being noticed by a single individual, despite being a 6’3”, 300-pound national celebrity.

Posthumous career

Life After Death, Wallace’s second album, debuted at #1 on the charts. The album was released only two weeks after his murder. Its lead single was “Hypnotize”, which was also the last music video he would take part in. Life After Death hit number one on the Billboard charts and spawned several hit singles in the United States. The album sold over 18 million copies worldwide and is one of the best selling hip-hop albums of all time. His biggest chart hit was “Mo Money, Mo Problems,” which featured Combs (under the rap alias “Puff Daddy”) and rapper Mase, and sampled the disco song “I’m Coming Out” by Diana Ross for the beat. The video is noted for having started the “Shiny Suit” era in hip hop. The last video single from Life After Death was “Sky’s The Limit,” featuring 112. The video for this song, directed by Spike Jonze, was noted for the use of children portraying Wallace and his contemporaries, such as Combs, Lil’ Kim, and Busta Rhymes. This technique has been recently used in the Three 6 Mafia music video for “Poppin’ My Collar.”

During the summer of 1997, Combs released his debut album, No Way Out, which featured Wallace on a number of songs, notably in the chorus of the single “Been Around the World” over a David Bowie sample (“Let’s Dance”). However, the single that carried this album to the top was “I’ll Be Missing You,” which was dedicated to Wallace’s memory. The song featured Puff Daddy, Wallace’s widow Faith Evans and 112. The song sampled The Police’s hit song “Every Breath You Take.” All these artists performed the song with former Police vocalist Sting during the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards.

In 1999, Combs released Wallace’s third album, Born Again. It had two hit singles: “N.O.T.O.R.I.O.U.S.,” featuring Puff Daddy and Lil’ Kim (interpolation to the Duran Duran’s song of the same name), and “Dead Wrong” a single that later was remixed with a verse from Eminem. The video for “N.O.T.O.R.I.O.U.S.” also featured appearances by 98 Degrees and Fat Joe.

In 2001, one of Wallace’s raps was featured in Michael Jackson’s song “Unbreakable,” which was included on his multi-platinum album Invincible. Wallace previously collaborated with Jackson in his 1995 song “This Time Around” from the autobiographical album HIStory.

In 2002, Combs gave 50 Cent rights to sample Wallace’s verses from “Niggaz” (a song from the Born Again album) into a song called “The Realest Niggaz.” It got out as a single and was a big hit on New York radio stations. Many have attributed that song as the first big break for 50 Cent, who is now one of hip-hop’s biggest superstars. The song was later put on the soundtrack for the 2003 hit movie Bad Boys 2 with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Later on in 2003, Eminem remixed the 1994 Wallace/Shakur collaboration “RUNNIN’” and added a sample of Edgar Winter’s “Dying to Live.” Titled “Runnin’ (Dying To Live)”, the song was released as a single from the soundtrack of Tupac: Resurrection.

On August 28, 2005, at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, Combs (who was hosting the event) and Snoop Dogg paid a well-received tribute to Wallace: an orchestra played while the lyrics from “Juicy” and “Warning” played on the arena speakers. In September 2005, VH1 had its second annual “Hip Hop Honors,” with a tribute to Wallace headlining the show. The long awaited The Notorious B.I.G. Duets: The Final Chapter album was released December 20, 2005. The album spawned the singles “Nasty Girl”, which became his first UK #1, as well as “Spit Your Game” “Whatchu Want” and “Hold Ya Head”.

On March 19, 2006, a judge ordered that sales of Ready to Die be halted because the title track apparently sampled “Singing in the Morning” by the Ohio Players without permission.

After Death - If He Were Alive

Many people associated with rap music continuously speculate about how different rap would be today if rappers like Wallace had never died. The rapper Jadakiss, who was a close associate of Biggie’s, stated in an appearance on MTV’s The Shop that most rappers popular today would “be taking fast food orders” if Wallace were still producing music. However, Wallace’s friends Lil’ Cease, Lil’ Kim, and Puff Daddy, all insist that he was not going to be in hip-hop for a very long time. In an interview with XXL Magazine (conducted in 1995 but released in 2003), Wallace himself said he was planning to retire from rap music in 2000 to manage the careers of Junior M.A.F.I.A.

In the song “1970 Somethin”, a song featuring West Coast Rapper The Game and Faith Evans, Game dedicates an entire verse to the New York Emcee. Similarily “copying” his rap style, emulating B.I.G Here is an excerpt:

“If I was in Brooklyn and B.I. was still alive In 2006, it might sound like this NY, 7-1-8’s, 2-1-2’s With Sue’s rendezvous, it’s like Moulin Rouge High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez Puerto Ricans with fat asses Blazed dutch masters, we dump ashes On models in S classes for you bastards Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin’ You hype, that Belly shit’ll get you capped and wrapped in plastic Tell the captain to ask Rog’ What’s Happenin’? I hear, nor speak no evil inside the magnum”

Movie

There is a movie in the works about Wallace’s life. Antoine Fuqua, the director of Training Day, will direct the film. The film is being produced by Wallace’s mother and by his former managers, Wayne Barrow and Mark Pitts.

Legacy

Biggie is widely celebrated as one of the all time greatest hip-hop artists. His lyrics have been sampled by many of today’s more famous names in hip hop, such as Jay-Z, Fat Joe, 50 Cent, Nelly, Pharrell, Snoop Dogg, Juelz Santana, Busta Rhymes, and even R&B stars such as Usher, Akon, Alicia Keys, and Ashanti. He is also sampled in Michael Jackson’s 2001 album INVINCIBLE in the song UNBREAKABLE.

In 2001, elite hip-hop magazine The Source crowned him as the greatest MC of all time. Likewise in 2003, when XXL Magazine asked many elite names in hip hop who they felt was the top 5 rappers of all time, Biggie’s named appeared on more rappers’ lists than any other MC. During Canibus’s 1998 feud with LL Cool J, Canibus responded to LL Cool J’s claim to be the greatest rapper of all time on the song Second Round K.O. by saying “the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th.”, which was the day Biggie died.

Unfortunately, a huge knock on Biggie’s legacy is the fact that he only recorded two albums while alive, with only two posthumous releases in the near-decade since his death. In 2006, MTV ranked Biggie as the #1 MC of all time, but later recinded that decision primarily due to a lack of material. However, he still ranked number #3, with 2Pac and Jay-Z ranked ahead of him.

At the time of his death, Wallace created a hip-hop supergroup called The Commission, which consisted of himself, Jay-Z, Lil’ Cease, P. Diddy and Charli Baltimore. A song on the duets album called Whatchu Want (The Commission) featuring Wallace and Jay-Z is based on the group.

* He collaborated with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, the only group who have had the opportunity to collaborate with Wallace and each of the late rappers 2Pac, Eazy-E, and Big Punisher in their lifetime. They were first featured with Wallace on the track “Notorious Thugs” which has been recently remixed in the track Spit Your Game. On “Notorious Thugs,” Biggie flips his usual flow to match the speed rapping of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.
* His song Big Poppa was featured throughout the 2001 movie Hardball.
* Both “Hypnotize” and “Mo Money, Mo Problems” hit #1 after Biggie’s death giving him two posthumous #1 hits - more than any other singer. Other posthumous #1 hits belong to Otis Redding (“The Dock Of The Bay”); Janis Joplin (“Me And Bobby McGee”); Jim Croce (“Time In A Bottle”); and, John Lennon (“(Just Like) Starting Over”).
* Wallace had the ability to create verses in his head and was able to freestyle tracks on the mic without the use of pen and paper. This skill was also shared by Jay-Z, which lead to their eventual friendship.
* Other artists who use this unique style of rapping (and cite Biggie as an influence) include Lil’ Wayne, Kanye West, Common, and Ja Rule.
* According to people close to him, Biggie had as much as five albums worth of lyrics in his head when he died.
* His song Big Poppa was featured in the 2007 movie Superbad.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Notorious+B.I.G."">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

No Doubt,"Formed in 1986 in Anaheim, California, United States as a ska punk band inspired by Madness, the lineup of No Doubt initially comprised John Spence as lead vocal, Gwen Stefani on back-up vocal, and Eric Stefani on keyboards. While playing the party-band circuit around Anaheim, the trio picked up bassist Tony Kanal. Hardened by the suicide of Spence in December 1987, No Doubt nevertheless continued; Gwen became the lone vocalist and the group added guitarist Tom Dumont and drummer Adrian Young. During their early years on the party scene, they played with Sublime, and Brad Nowell sang on No Doubt's Total Hate 95. Gwen Stefani returned the favour on Saw Red.
No Doubt's live act began to attract regional interest, and Interscope Records signed them in 1991. The band's debut a year later, an odd fusion of '80s and ska, sank without a trace in the wake of the grunge movement. As a result, Interscope refused to support No Doubt's tour or further recordings. The band responded by recording on their own during 1993-94; the result was the self-released The Beacon Street Collection, much rawer and more punk-inspired than the debut. Eric Stefani left just after its release, later working as an animator for The Simpsons. By late 1994, Interscope allowed recordings to resume, and Tragic Kingdom was released in October 1995. The album's third single, Don't Speak, which although originally written by Eric was later altered by Gwen to document her breakup with bassist Tony Kanal. Tragic Kingdom went platinum and has sold over 15 million copies to date. As Tragic Kingdom obtained success, the band toured furiously until late '97. 

After a long break, the band had prepared a more mellow, and powerfully dramatic album entitled Return of Saturn. It emphasized Gwen's encounters with men, her biological clock, and miscellaneous topics. Although the album had a completely different approach to it, the band was making rock music with less of a punk/ska flare. The album debuted at #2 on the Billboard charts in early April of 2000, and then declined to a flop. The public never did justice to the album, and it serves as a favorite for many die-hard fans.

While touring in Jamaica for Return of Saturn, the band wanted to try adding Reggae to their music, and making more of a dance rock record. 20 months after Return of Saturn debuted, the band was quick to jump on the creation of Rock Steady, released in December of '01. The singles Underneath It All and Hey Baby became international dance club symbols as top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. This album proved that No Doubt had not lost their potential with the public, and that they could appeal to various groups of people. 

In 2004, No Doubt announced they would be going on hiatus after the release of the singles compilation The Singles 1992–2003, which contained one new song, a cover of experimental rock band Talk Talk's ""It's My Life"". Tony Kanal did several projects with Gwen and other artists. Adrian Young married and had a child; Tom Dumont formed a new band, Invincible Overlord, often plays with Matt Costa's band. Gwen embarked on a sucessful solo career which consisted of two albums - ""Love. Angel. Music. Baby."" and ""The Sweet Escape"". The first of these albums contains the single ""Hollaback Girl"", a song which was inescapable for most of 2005 and hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and won her a Billboard Award for first track to reach 1 Million legal downloads ever. The self titled track off ""The Sweet Escape"" went on to become her most notorious calling card.

With the hiatus officially over in late 2008 No Doubt announced tour plans for 2009, kicking it off in Atlantic City.  The tour concluded with four dates in Irvine, CA. In May, 2009, the band was featured as a fictional 80's band, ""Snowed Out"", on CW Network's ""Gossip Girl""  The band performed their cover of Adam and the Ants 'Stand and Deliver.'

The group entered the studio in May 2010 to start recording on their sixth studio album: Push and Shove which will be release on September 25, 2012 and its first single will be ""Settle Down"". Their first music video for the new album will also be for ""Settle Down"" and it will be directed by Sophie Muller (who previously has done numerous music videos for No Doubt). The whole album has been recorded with producer Mark ""Spike"" Stent (who worked on their previous album Rock Steady) but they have also collaborated with Major Lazer (now Diplo's solo project). No Doubt previously revealed they are taking influence from ska, 80s new wave and Jamaican reggae music for the new record. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/No+Doubt"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Tiësto,"Tiësto is a name that no longer needs an introduction. He is synonymous with the best of electronic music, and continues to inspire a generation of up-and-coming young artists.

In addition to two Grammy nominations and a Grammy win in 2015, Tiësto has been named the #1 DJ by Rolling Stone, voted “The Greatest DJ of All Time” by Mixmag, ranked the #1 DJ in the world three times by DJ Mag, and was recently awarded the Edison Pop Oeuvre Lifetime Achievement Award (an honor he shares with David Bowie, Quincy Jones and U2 among others).

After conquering the house and trance worlds, the superstar producer led the charge in helping electronic music crossover into the mainstream with his last album, A Town Called Paradise in 2014. His single “Red Lights” is now certified gold in the US, Sweden and Canada, while “Wasted” with Matthew Koma recently went platinum in the US and is his highest-charting release to date. Clearly a taste of what was to come, Tiësto has recently dropped new tunes with the The Chainsmokers, Martin Garrix, and pop sensation Natalie La Rose.

Collaborations are nothing new for Tiësto, who believes in passing along his success by working with well-known names like Martin Garrix and Oliver Heldens, to name a few. For years now, he has helped up-and-coming acts in the electronic world find their way with his record label, Musical Freedom. Aside from his label, he also took part in 7Up’s DJing competition “Your Shot,” a competition for aspiring DJ’s to learn the craft and perform alongside Tiësto in Las Vegas.

At this point in his career, Tiësto has toured the world countless times, performing for millions at Ultra, Coachella, Tomorrowland, TomorrowWorld and Electric Daisy Carnival, in addition to the innumerable clubs that he headlines. He’s one of the few DJs in the world to hold a residency in Las Vegas, where he plays at Hakkasan and Wet Republic.

In spite of his hectic tour schedule, residency, and focus on creating new music, Tiësto hasn’t forgotten his roots. As a champion of the DJ mix for decades, his Club Life compilations have become a staple in the dance world as has his Sirius XM channel of the same name. In addition, his weekly radio show is broadcast on 350 stations in 77 countries and has over 35 million listeners.

Tiësto also remains an expert remixer to the biggest names in music, reworking smash hits for the likes of Beyoncé, Coldplay, Kanye West, Sam Smith, Ellie Goulding, David Guetta, Major Lazer, Calvin Harris, and many more. In 2015, he won his first Grammy Award for his massively popular remix of John Legend’s “All Of Me.”

Tiësto has successfully transitioned his influence and savvy to industries beyond music, acting as an advisor to tech startups like Splice, Dubset and Doppler. Most recently, Tiësto released his newly re-designed mobile app, where fans can consume all things Tiësto. Through current collaborations with T-Mobile and Budweiser and soon-to-be-revealed efforts in the fashion space, the DJ is bringing dance music culture to more people than ever before.

Throughout the past two decades, Tiësto has remained not only one of the world’s most prolific and enduring artists, but one of music’s top innovators. In spite of his accomplishments, Tiësto does not see his work as being done. “DJing is my life,” the man isn’t afraid to admit. But more than that, “It’s a lifestyle.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ti%C3%ABsto"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

PJ Harvey,"PJ Harvey is an abbreviation of singer-songwriter Polly Jean Harvey (b. 9 Oct 1969 in Yeovil and raised in nearby Corscombe, Dorset, England) and a name of two acts. First was a Harvey-led trio, formed in 1991 with Rob Ellis (drums) and Steve Vaughan (bass), which débuted with Dry (Mar 1992). Overlapping with the trio, Harvey reused the name for solo work, inaugurated by 4-Track Demos (Oct 1993). The trio broke up in 1995 and Harvey continued solo - with her album Let England Shake (Feb 2011) and her latest album The Hope Six Demolition Project (April 2016).

The trio's material on Dry and Rid of Me was praised by critics for its raw, guitar-driven sound and sharp-witted, melancholic lyrics. After the trio broke up, in 1995, Harvey released To Bring You My Love, a blues-heavy album that expanded the range of her sound through the incorporation of strings, organs, and electronic sound effects.  Her stage show became more theatrical, with Harvey performing in ballgowns, pink catsuits, wigs and garish, vampish make-up. Never one to rest, she followed this album with the softer, more experimental Is This Desire?, released in 1998, and then Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea, released in 2000, which combined her more guitar-driven work with cleaner, lusher arrangements. Stories won her the 2001 Mercury Prize.

In 2004 she released Uh Huh Her, a return to her earlier, rawer sound. Uh Huh Her was met with a somewhat mixed response; while some critics welcomed Harvey's re-exploration of her previous styles, others felt that the album was something of a rehash. Around the same time, she produced and co-wrote half of Marianne Faithfull's album Before the Poison, which received much critical praise.

Apparently the result of writer's block (according to reports made by the BBC), 2007's White Chalk saw Harvey exploring new territory. Jettisoning her trademark guitar-driven sound, White Chalk was a collection of eerie, skeletal piano ballads; Harvey received widespread praise for the album. In 2011, Harvey released the album Let England Shake, in which she explored war-related themes, using Britain's involvement in World War I as a historical backdrop. The album received widespread critical acclaim and won Harvey her second Mercury Prize; to date, she is the only person to win the prize more than once.

On April 15, 2016, PJ Harvey released her 9th studio album entitled ""The Hope Six Demolition Project"".

PJ Harvey has collaborated with a number of other artists, including: Nick Cave, Thom Yorke, Björk, John Parish, Tricky, Sparklehorse, Pascal Comelade and Mark Lanegan. She has also been a collaborator in the Desert Sessions, along with Josh Homme, Jeordie White, Dave Catching, Nick Oliveri, Mark Lanegan, Chris Goss, Alain Johannes and Dean Ween. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/PJ+Harvey"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Duran Duran,"Duran Duran (named after a character in Roger Vadim's sci-fi classic, Barbarella) is an electronic pop rock band that was part of the New Wave movement of the 80s and 90s. Created by Nick Rhodes (keyboards) and John Taylor (bass) in Birmingham, England in 1978, it later add took in Roger Taylor  (drums), Andy Taylor (guitar), and Simon Le Bon (lead vocals). The band has sold more than 70 million records over their more than 35 years of existence, making them one of the best-selling groups in history.

Their songs are often vivid, hook-laden pieces dance pop that have fared well on the radio, but what many remember best about Duran Duran is their iconic music videos. Though many of the videos were tongue-in-cheek, the band has never quite escaped the glamorous and decadent 'jet set' image that their early videos projected. Their flashy outfits and strident, art rock influenced music showed an immense debt to 70s English glam artists such as David Bowie and Roxy Music, yet the band grasped a sense of their own identity and became one of the keystones of the new romantic movement.

Their first singer and one of their original founding members was Stephen Duffy, and their original bassist was Simon Colley. Several drummers and guitarists were subsequently tried, as well as a handful of vocalists, after Duffy left Duran Duran early in 1979. The band felt that they had something special with vocalist Simon Le Bon, and the group smashed into the pop scene shortly afterwards when ""Planet Earth"", their debut single, was released on 2 February 1981.

""Planet Earth"" became an immediate hit in the band's native U.K., reaching #12 on the U.K. Singles Chart on 21 February, and it did even better in Australia, hitting #8 there. Being Duran Duran's first Top 10 hit anywhere in the world, the song showed the group's interest in international stardom. The band's eponymous debut album came out promptly afterwards in June 1981. 'Duran Duran' hit #3 on the album charts and remained in the U.K. Top 100 for 117 weeks, achieving platinum status by December 1982. The initial United States release failed to generate much interest at first, but the group was a British sensation due to their strident mix of pop rock and electronic music.

Music videos for hit singles ""Planet Earth"" and ""Careless Memories"" were filmed in December 1980. As they also experienced considerable success with ""Girls on Film"", which hit #5 on the UK Singles Chart and #11 on the Australian Singles Chart, the group firmly grasped the opportunity to make a name for themselves in musical television. As their fame grew, some fans worried that Duran Duran could have peaked too early. They headed into AIR Studios in London in early 1982 anxious to somehow top themselves.

Band member John Taylor came up with the new album's title, 'Rio', as a product of his fascination with the flaunting sexuality and diverse atmosphere of Brazil. He later said, ""Rio, to me, was shorthand for the truly foreign, the exotic, a cornucopia of earthly delights, a party that would never stop."" The band had their own plans and ambitions for promotion and reunited with director Russell Mulcahy (who was behind the video for ""Planet Earth"") to plan out the release of a full length 'video album'— eleven videos in total. Totally dedicated to on-site filming,  guitarist Andy Taylor even contracted a tropical virus and ended up hospitalized, thankfully getting better relatively quickly.

'Rio' was, simply, a commercial juggernaut. The band's second studio album, originally released worldwide on 10 May 1982, reached #2 in the UK and #1 in Australia. Massively popular in the U.S., it earned a gold disc on 1 March 1983 and went platinum on 26 April 1983, eventually reaching double-platinum status. As songs such as ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" and ""Rio"" received considerable airplay, critical acclaim also grew for the release. With MTV heavily playing the band's music videos, the album is still held as one of the best new wave albums ever. In April 2013, 'Rio' was even voted #3 in BBC Radio 2's 'Top 100 Favourite Albums of all time' list.

In 1985, Duran Duran performed ""A View To A Kill"" for the the James Bond film of the same name. The song appeared in the movie's title sequence and was also a best-selling single in its own right. In 1987, ""Out Of My Mind"" was featured at the end credits of the drama film 'The Saint' as well.

Like Depeche Mode, Duran Duran was among the earliest bands to work on their own remixes. From the very beginning, the band had a keen sense of style, and worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as Kahn & Bell and Antony Price to build a sharp and elegant image, soon growing beyond the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured New Romantic look.

Although the group never disbanded, it went through several line-up changes over the years - American guitarist Warren Cuccurullo (formerly of Missing Persons) was also a member of the band from 1989 to 2001, and drummer Sterling Campbell was a member from 1989 to 1991. John Taylor, Roger Taylor and Andy Taylor all returned in 2001 and created a stir among music media and the band's fans. Duran Duran released the first album from the reunited line-up, Astronaut, in 2004, which was in turn followed up by many sold out shows in England, most notably Wembley Arena, where a live DVD of the tour was filmed in 2004/2005.

In October of 2006, it was announced on Duran Duran's website that Andy Taylor had left the band. The band's latest album, 'Red Carpet Massacre' was released in November 2007.  They performed the album live in New York City on Broadway at the Barrymore Theater, for what was originally scheduled as an unprecedented 10-night run. A stage hand union strike shortened the run by a few nights, but Duran Duran were able to re-schedule the shows elsewhere. They went on to tour the world, ending their successful run in December of 2008. 

2008 also saw the release of a new DVD that documents the making of their now-classic ""Rio"" album (called ""Classic Albums: Rio (Collector's Edition)""), and a book called ""Would Someone Please Explain?""- a compilation of questions from the ""Ask Katy"" area of their popular website.   

Duran Duran returned at the end of 2010 with their 13th album, the digital and self-released album All You Need Is Now which debuted at number one on the iTunes charts in many countries (including the USA).  The physical version of the album will be released with bonus tracks in February 2011.  The album was produced by Mark Ronson.  

2015 saw the band return with the album Paper Gods, which was led by the single ""Pressure Off"" featuring Janelle Monae and Nile Rodgers. The album was the band's first top 10 chart success in the U.S. in over 20 years, and also reached number 5 in the U.K.

Charli XCX,"Charli XCX, born Charlotte Emma Aitchison on 2 August 1992, is an English singer and songwriter. She released her debut single independently in 2008 and initially performed at warehouse raves in London, UK. She signed to Asylum Records in 2010, and released two mixtapes, Heartbreaks and Earthquakes and Super Ultra, in 2012. 

Charli XCX's major label debut album, True Romance, was released in 2013, accompanied by singles including ""You (Ha Ha Ha)"" and ""Nuclear Seasons"". She rose to prominence during 2013 and 2014 when she co-wrote and was featured on two successful singles, Icona Pop's ""I Love It"" and Iggy Azalea's ""Fancy"". Her 2014 single ""Boom Clap"" from the soundtrack album of The Fault in Our Stars became a top ten single in a number of countries. It also preceded the release of her second album, Sucker, which featured the singles ""Break the Rules"", ""Doing It"" and ""Famous"".

In a July 2015 interview, Charli XCX said that she was working on her third album and described it as ""the most pop thing, and the most electronic thing"" she had ever done. British producer SOPHIE has been confirmed to be involved in the album's production, along with other producers, such as BloodPop and Stargate. In early 2016, Charli set up a new record label, Vroom Vroom Recordings, and released an EP titled Vroom Vroom, as the teaser for her third studio album.

Charli XCX has toured alongside artists and bands such as Ellie Goulding, Marina and the Diamonds (whom she has also collaborated with), Paramore, Bleachers, Azealia Banks and Coldplay during her career. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Charli+XCX"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Gwen Stefani,"Gwen Stefani (born October 3, 1969 in Anaheim, California, United States) is a singer-songwriter and fashion designer. Since 1986 she has fronted the rock band No Doubt, whose 1995 release Tragic Kingdom spawned the singles Just a Girl, Spiderwebs, and Don't Speak and propelled them into stardom with sales of 16 million copies worldwide. 

In 2004, Stefani released her first solo album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. The album featured several collaborations with producers and other artists, including No Doubt bandmate Tony Kanal, Linda Perry, André 3000, Nellee Hooper, and The Neptunes. It was primarily inspired by pop and new wave music of the 1980s, and emerged an international success with sales of over seven million copies. The third single Hollaback Girl became the first U.S. digital download to sell one million copies.

The debut album also drew attention to the Harajuku Girls, Stefani's entourage of four Japanese backup dancers named for the fashionable suburb in Tokyo. Originally hired in 2004 for the album, the Girls continued to appear alongside Stefani, and are featured in these music videos: ""What You Waiting For?"", ""Rich Girl"", ""Hollaback Girl"", ""Luxurious"", ""Crash"", ""Wind It Up"", ""The Sweet Escape"", and ""Now That You Got It"".

Stefani's second solo album The Sweet Escape was released December 5, 2006. Collaborating again with her on the project were Perry, The Neptunes, along with Akon and Tim Rice-Oxley of Keane, and producers Pharrell and Kanal. Despite mixed reviews of the album as a whole, the title track The Sweet Escape became an international success and earned Stefani a Grammy nomination, and remains the most successful song of her solo career.

Although it had been speculated that the album would contain only material originally written for L.A.M.B. that did not make the final cut, only two songs left over from L.A.M.B. were included in the record: 80's-influenced U Started It; and Wonderful Life, which features Depeche Mode's Martin L. Gore on guitar.

Stefani is equally known as a fashion trendsetter. In 2003, she created a clothing fashion line named L.A.M.B. which shares the initials of her debut solo album. This collection was later expanded with the introduction of a newer line in 2005 called Harajuku Lovers, which draws its inspiration from Japanese culture and fashion.

On May 26, 2006, Stefani gave birth to her first child, a baby boy named Kingston James McGregor Rossdale. The father is British grunge musician Gavin Rossdale, former frontman of the now-defunct bands Bush and Institute, who she married in 2002. 

In January 2008, Stefani's father-in-law confirmed that she would be expecting her second child in the summer. On August 21, 2008, second son Zuma Nesta Rock Rossdale was born.
Gwen Stefani said in 2011 that she was no more planning to release another solo album. 

On April 12, 2014, Stefani made a surprise appearance at the Coachella festival, where she joined Pharrell Williams onstage during his set to perform ""Hollaback Girl"". She and Williams were coaches for season 7 of The Voice. After nine years since the last time, she attended the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, and during an interview on the red carpet she said, ""I didn't know I was gonna have a baby, I didn't know I was gonna be on The Voice, I didn't know I was gonna be writing new music, so I'm just like, what's gonna be next?"".

On September 8, 2014, Stefani told MTV News during New York Fashion Week that she is working on both a No Doubt album and a solo album. She also revealed that she is working with Williams. Stefani released her comeback single ""Baby Don't Lie"" on October 20, 2014, co-written with producers Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco, and Noel Zancanella. Billboard magazine revealed that her third studio album is set to be released in December and Benny Blanco is set to executive produce it. In late October, a sneak peek of a new track from Stefani's third album, named ""Spark the Fire"", was premiered. The song was produced by Pharrell Williams.

On October 17, 2015, Stefani performed a one-night concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, where she performed a new song, reportedly about her breakup with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, titled ""Used to Love You"". It was released as a digital download on October 20, 2015. The video was released later that same day. The song was released to Mainstream radio in the U.S. on October 27, 2015. The track is the first official single off her upcoming third solo album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like, which she has been working on since June. Neither ""Baby Don't Lie"" or ""Spark the Fire"" will be included on the album. Stefani said much of the previous material felt forced and inauthentic, while the songs written since she returned to the studio are more natural and better describe where she is in her life. The album's second single, ""Make Me Like You"", was released on February 12, 2016. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Gwen+Stefani"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Michael Bublé,"Michael Steven Bublé (born 9 September 1975 in Burnaby, British Columbia) is a Canadian singer and actor. He has won several awards, including three Grammy Awards and multiple Juno Awards. His first album reached the top ten in the United Kingdom and his home country of Canada. He found worldwide commercial success with his 2005 album It's Time, and his 2007 album Call Me Irresponsible was an even bigger success, reaching number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and the European charts. Bublé's fifth studio album, Christmas, was released on October 24, 2011 in the United Kingdom] and October 25, 2011 in the United States. The Cold December Night Songfacts states it was produced by David Foster, Bob Rock and Humberto Gatica. The album was recorded primarily at Capitol Recording Studios in Hollywood and The Warehouse Studios in Vancouver during July.

Michael Bublé’s introduction to the music of the swing era came to him through his grandfather, who filled his grandson’s ears with the sounds of The Mills Brothers, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, and others. As Bublé eagerly absorbed the recordings, he began to realize that he wanted to be a singer and that this style of music, virtually foreign to his own generation, was what he wanted to perform.

With his grandfather’s assistance, Bublé soon learned a whole catalog of tunes and gained experience and exposure by singing as a guest with several local bands. While still in his teen years, he won the Canadian Youth Talent Search, released several independent albums, and performed in a musical review titled Swing that traveled across the U.S. It wasn’t long before Bublé was introduced to Grammy-winning producer David Foster during a famous Canadian wedding of Brian Mulroney’s daughter Caroline Mulroney. He later signed his first major recording contract with Reprise Records after that encounter.

The two Canadians began work on a debut album that would incorporate Bublé’s aptitude for pop standards into songs that spanned several decades. His self-titled debut disc was released in early 2003, and featured jazzy takes on old standards like “Fever” and “The Way You Look Tonight” as well as newer classics like “Moondance” and “How Can You Mend A Broken Heart”.

He finished off 2003 with an EP of holiday material, Let It Snow, and began 2004 with the live CD/DVD set Come Fly With Me. In 2005, It’s Time was a number one hit in Canada, Japan, Italy, and Australia, and made the top ten of both the UK and US. Later that year he released the live album Caught in the Act. More recently, Michael received a 2010 Grammy Award for 'Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album' for 'Michael Bublé Meets Madison Square Garden. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Michael+Bubl%C3%A9"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Journey,"There are at least three artists with this name
1. A popular American rock band
2. A British psychedelic trance producer
3. An underground rapper

Journey is an American rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1973. The band has gone through several phases since its inception by former members of Santana. The band's greatest commercial success came in the late 1970s through the early 1980s with a series of power ballads and songs such as ""Don't Stop Believin'"", ""Any Way You Want It"", ""Faithfully"", ""Open Arms"", ""Separate Ways"", and ""Wheel in the Sky"".

Journey has been eligible for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame since 2000, but Gregg Rolie is currently the only member of Journey who has been inducted — as a member of parent band Santana. In 2009, Steve Perry, the band's best-known lead vocalist, will be eligible for induction as a solo artist.

Formation, 1973–1976

The original members of Journey came together in San Francisco in 1973 under the auspices of former Santana manager Herbie Herbert. Originally called the Golden Gate Rhythm Section and intended to serve as a backup group for established Bay Area artists, the band included recent Santana alumni Neal Schon on lead guitar and Gregg Rolie on keyboards and lead vocals. Drummer Prairie Prince of The Tubes, bassist Ross Valory and rhythm guitarist George Tickner, both of Frumious Bandersnatch, rounded out the group. The band quickly abandoned the original ""backup group"" concept and developed a distinctive jazz fusion style. After an unsuccessful radio contest to name the group, roadie John Villaneuva suggested the name ""Journey."" The band's first public appearance came at the Winterland Ballroom on New Year’s Eve, 1973. Prairie Prince rejoined The Tubes shortly thereafter, and the band hired British drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who had recently worked with John Lennon and Frank Zappa. On February 5, 1974, the new line-up made their debut at the Great American Music Hall and secured a recording contract with Columbia Records.

Journey released their eponymous first album in 1975, and rhythm guitarist Tickner left the band before they cut their second album, Look into the Future (1976). Neither album achieved significant sales, so Schon, Valory, and Dunbar took singing lessons in an attempt to add vocal harmonies to Rolie's lead. The following year's Next contained shorter tracks with more vocals and featured Schon as lead singer on several of the songs.

New musical direction, 1977–1980

Journey's album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties. The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and together the new incarnation of the band wrote the hit ""Wheel in the Sky"". But fans were lukewarm to the change, and personality differences resulted in Fleischman being fired within the year.

In the fall of 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. Perry added a clean, tenor sound and the band became a true pop act. Their fourth album, Infinity (1978) reached No. 21 on the album charts and gave the band their first RIAA-certified platinum album plus hit singles out of ""Lights"" and ""Wheel In the Sky"".

Drummer Aynsley Dunbar did not get along with singer Steve Perry and did not approve of the new musical direction. He was fired in 1978 and replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith. Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith, and bass player Ross Valory recorded 1979's Evolution, which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, ""Lovin,' Touchin,' Squeezin""; and 1980's Departure, which reached No. 8 on the album charts and included the top-25 hit ""Any Way You Want It"".

Journey's newfound success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base. During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured. They also recorded the soundtrack to the film Dream After Dream while in Japan.

Exhausted from extensive touring, keyboardist Gregg Rolie now left a successful band for the second time in his career. Keyboardist Stevie Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, ""The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love)"", but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement. With Cain's replacement of Rolie's Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised to redefine rock music for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success.

Height of popularity, 1981–1983

Journey released their eighth and biggest-selling studio album, Escape, in 1981. The album, which has thus far sold nine times platinum, went to number one on the album charts that year, and included three top-ten hits: ""Who's Crying Now"", ""Don't Stop Believin'"", and ""Open Arms"".

Capitalizing on their success, the band recorded radio commercials for Budweiser and sold rights to their likenesses and music for use in two video games: the Journey arcade game by Bally/Midway and Journey Escape by Data Age for the Atari 2600.

This success was met with piqued criticism. The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide gave each of the band's albums only one star, with Dave Marsh writing that ""Journey was a dead end for San Francisco area rock"". Marsh later would anoint Escape as one of the worst number-one albums of all time.

Journey's next album, 1983's Frontiers, continued their commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the album charts. Four hit singles included ""Separate Ways"", which reached #8, and ""Faithfully, which reached #12. During the subsequent tour, the band contracted with NFL Films to record a video documentary of their life on the road, Frontiers and Beyond.

Break-up, 1984–1994

Lead singer Steve Perry and guitarist Neal Schon both pursued solo projects between 1982 and 1985, and when they returned to Journey to record their 1986 album Raised on Radio, bass player Ross Valory and drummer Steve Smith were fired from the band for musical and professional differences. Studio musicians handled the two vacant slots, including future American Idol judge Randy Jackson and established session player Larrie Londin. The album sold two million copies. A truncated tour followed, which featured Jackson on bass and Mike Baird on drums. Steve Perry left Journey in 1987.

Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain teamed up with Cain's ex-Babys bandmates John Waite and Ricky Phillips, forming Bad English with drummer Deen Castronovo in 1988. Steve Smith started a jazz band, Vital Information, and teamed up with Ross Valory and Gregg Rolie to create The Storm with singer Kevin Chalfant and guitarist Josh Ramos.

Reunion, 1995–1997

Between 1987 and 1995, Journey's record label released three compilations. In October 1993, Kevin Chalfant (of The Storm) performed with Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain at a roast for manager Herbie Herbert for the Thunder Road benefit. After that, Schon, Cain, Valory, Smith and Rolie briefly considered reuniting the band with Chalfant as lead singer. But in 1995 Steve Perry agreed to rejoin the band on the condition that they seek new management. Herbie Herbert was fired and The Eagles Manager Irving Azoff retained.

In 1995, Perry, Schon, Cain, Valory, and Smith reunited to record Trial by Fire. Released in 1996, the album included the hit single ""When You Love a Woman"", which reached #12 on the Billboard charts and was nominated in 1997 for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

Plans for a subsequent tour ended when Perry injured his hip hiking in Hawaii in the summer of 1997 and could not perform without hip replacement surgery — which he refused to undergo. In 1998, Schon and Cain decided to seek a new lead singer, at which point drummer Steve Smith left the band as well.

Lead singer replaced, 1998–2006

In 1998, Journey hired drummer Deen Castronovo, Schon's and Cain's Bad English bandmate, and drummer for Hardline, to replace Steve Smith. The lead vocalist position was filled by Steve Augeri, formerly of Tyketto and Tall Stories.

That same year, Journey with Steve Augeri and Deen Castronovo recorded a track for the soundtrack to the movie Armageddon called ""Remember Me"". The band released their next studio album, Arrival, in Japan in late 2000 and in the United States in 2001. ""All the Way"" became a minor adult contemporary hit from the album. In 2002, the band released a four-track CD titled ""Red 13"", with an album cover design chosen through a fan contest. In 2005 the band was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, embarked on their 30th anniversary tour, and released their twelfth full-length studio album, Generations, in which each band member performed lead vocals on at least one song.

Lead singer replaced again, 2006–present

In July 2006, Steve Augeri was dropped from the band while they toured with Def Leppard, with the official statement citing a 'chronic throat infection' as the problem. Augeri had been suffering from vocal attrition problems since 2003 and Journey had been using pre-recorded lead vocals. The band hired singer Jeff Scott Soto from Talisman to fill in, and Soto officially replaced Augeri as Journey's lead singer in December 2006. On June 12, 2007, Journey announced that Soto was no longer the lead singer, and said that they were looking to move in a new direction.

In December 2007, after briefly considering the lead singer of a Virginia-based tribute band, Journey hired Filipino singer Arnel Pineda of the cover band The Zoo after Neal Schon saw him on YouTube singing covers of Journey songs. Journey debuted their new lead singer in February 2008 in Chile, released the album Revelation, and announced a summer tour with Heart and Cheap Trick. Revelation debuted at #5 on the Billboard charts, selling more than 196,000 units in its first two weeks, making it the band's best selling album since Trial by Fire. 

Although Pineda was not the first foreign national to become a member of Journey (former drummer Aynsley Dunbar is British) nor even the first non-white (former bass player Randy Jackson is Black), the transition was difficult for a number of fans who expressed what Marin Independent Journal writer Paul Liberatore called ""an undercurrent of racism."" Keyboardist Jonathan Cain responded to such sentiments: ""We've become a world band. We're international now. We're not about one color.""

UK Based psychedelic trance producer Giampiero ""Jay"" Mastino studied Sound Engineering and Music Technology in 2003 and soon thereafter began solo production under the name Journey, and in collaboration with Anton Petrov as Star~Trip. In 2009 he also started a new progressive project under the name OM.  Jay also DJ's under the name Jay OM.

In 2004, he conceived the vision of a network of like-minded artists in the psy-trance and ambient genres, all working to promote themselves and each other under one banner. Thus the Free-Spirit Records label was born... Originally intended to focus on artist management, the label's skyrocketing success combined with the enthusiasm of Jay, the artists, and fans enabled Free-Spirit to outgrow its horizons. Free-Spirit continues to build a collective of artists and djs from around the globe, aiming to create and provide access to a combined set of resources not available to them as individuals, making it just a little easier for all to concentrate on what they truly love, which is the music!

Free-Spirit Vol.1 ""Brahamaputra"", the debut release for Free-Spirit Records compiled by Jay OM, hit the shops in October 2006, featuring both a Journey and a Star~Trip track amongst others and Christopher Lawrence (ranked No. 4 DJ in the world) featured Journey's Spotless mind in his Top 10 in December 2006. Free-Spirit Vol.2 ""Eupsychia"" followed in June 2007 with 2 more tracks from Journey and Star~Trip and in 2008 a another 3 releases on Free-Spirit Vol.3 ""Neophilia"" and V/A Children of Jah (Revolve Magazine). 2009 saw the release of Journey's highly anticipated debut solo Album ""The Man who Sold the Time"" as well as further releases on various V/A Compilations on Mutagen, Antu, Solar Tech. Catalyst, Alchemy and Free-Spirit Records.  Jay is currently working  on his 2nd Journey solo album.

Today, Jay's reputation as an active, involved, and hard working individual in the global trance circuit precedes him. His commitment and enthusiasm for trance music has left an indelible impression on the world scene already, and Jay's future has never looked brighter, from his burgeoningly successful record label to his organized events in the UK, to his upcoming solo releases.  Jay works tirelessly at his art and trade and the music he brings to the masses exemplifies the fruits of his labour and energy.

Three Days Grace,"Three Days Grace is a Canadian rock band, formed under the name Groundswell in Norwood, Ontario, Canada in 1992. After a breakup in 1995, the band reformed in 1997 under its current name and with a line-up consisting of guitarist and lead vocalist Adam Gontier, drummer and backing vocalist Neil Sanderson, and bassist Brad Walst. In 2003, Barry Stock was recruited as the band's lead guitarist.

After signing to Jive Records, Three Days Grace released two studio albums, Three Days Grace in 2003 and One-X in 2006, both of which have been certified platinum and double platinum in the US and Canada, respectively. In 2007, the band was declared number one rock artist of the year by Billboard and was the number four artist in airplay in Canada that same year. The band's third album, Life Starts Now, was released on September 22, 2009.


History

Three Days Grace formed in 1992 under the name Groundswell in Norwood, Ontario, Canada. Groundswell's line-up consisted of five members: Adam Gontier (vocals, guitar), Neil Sanderson (backing vocals, drums), Brad Walst (bass), Phil Crowe (guitar), and Joe Grant (guitar), all of whom were attending high school when the band formed.

In 1997, after being disbanded for two years, the band regrouped in Toronto as a trio consisting of Gontier, Sanderson, and Walst. They also changed their name to ""Three Days Grace"". According to Gontier, the name stands for the question: If you had three days to change something in your life, could you do it? Once in Toronto, the band became acquainted with local producer Gavin Brown. The band gave him several years of material that they had created since forming, and he ""picked out what he called 'the golden nuggets'"", according to Gontier. Brown and the band polished the songs into a demo album which they gave to EMI Music Publishing Canada. The record label wanted to hear more material, and with Brown producing, the band created the song, ""I Hate Everything About You"", which attracted the interest of several record labels. The band was soon signed to Jive Records after being sought out by the company's president.


Three Days Grace (2003 - 2005)

After being signed to Jive, the band moved to Long View Farms, a studio in Boston, to record their debut album. The self-titled album was finished in Woodstock, New York and released on July 22, 2003. It was met with generally favorable reviews. Dave Doray of IGN said of the album, ""Mistakes? There's not many."" Allmusic reviewer Heather Phares said that on Three Days Grace, ""the band's focus and adherence to alt-metal's formulas — coupled with tight songwriting and some unexpectedly pretty choruses — results in a strong tracks that are more memorable than the work of many of their peers"". She did criticize the album for its simplicity, concluding, ""Three Days Grace are definitely one of the most accessible alt-metal bands of the 2000s; they just need to add some more distinctiveness to their sound.""

After acquiring lead guitarist Barry Stock in late 2003, Three Days Grace toured continuously and extensively for almost two years in support of their major label debut. The album peaked at number nine on the Canadian Albums Chart and number 69 on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum in the US by the RIAA in December 2004 and double platinum in Canada by the CRIA.


One-X (2006 - 2008)

While touring in support of Three Days Grace, Gontier became depressed and addicted to drugs and alcohol. He went into rehab after the band finished touring, and while there, began writing material for the band's second album. After leaving rehab, he rejoined the band in a cottage in Ontario to finish writing material for the album. In a 2006 interview, Gontier said that the album's material was more personal to him than the band's previous release, being based on the despondence, drug abuse, and rehab that constituted the past two years of his life. The album, titled One-X, was then released on June 13, 2006, and was guitarist Barry Stock's recorded debut.

One-X was met with generally favorable reviews. The Toronto Star complimented the album with a review title of ""One CD worth buying..."" and focused on its lyrics, saying, ""The lyrics really speak out to you, especially if you're going through a tough time in your life."" Allmusic reviewer Corey Apar praised the music, saying it ""remains catchy despite its lyrical darkness"". The album did receive some negative criticism. Apar pointed out that Three Days Grace is ""hardly innovative"" in their approach to writing music and that ""further distinctive qualities"" would help the band separate itself ""from their alt-metal peers"".

One-X peaked at number two on the Canadian album chart and at number five on the Billboard 200, selling 78,000 copies in the US in its first week of release. Its first single, ""Animal I Have Become"", was Three Days Grace's most successful, becoming 2006's most played rock song in Canada, and the album helped propel Three Days Grace to become the number one rock artist in airplay in the US and Canada in 2007, with Billboard ranking them as the number one rock artist of the year in 2007. One-X was certified platinum by the RIAA in the US on August 30, 2007, and double platinum by the CRIA in Canada in July 2007. Three Days Grace toured the US and Canada throughout the second half of 2006 and all of 2007 in support of One-X. In early 2008, they toured alongside Seether and Breaking Benjamin across the US


Life Starts Now (2009 - 2011)

From March to August 2008, to January to April 2009, Three Days Grace recorded their third album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Los Angeles, with producer Howard Benson, who had worked with them on their previous releases. The album, entitled Life Starts Now, was released on September 22, 2009. Critics as well as band members have noted the album's departure from the angry tone of the band's previous releases into a lyrical style that comes off as more optimistic. According to guitarist Barry Stock, the album's theme centers around ""a new sense of freshness"" and the idea that ""you don't have to be stuck in whatever it is you're dealing with. Whether it's good or bad, it's your choice to make a change.""

Life Starts Now debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, Three Days Grace's highest chart position, and sold 79,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with mixed reviews. Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star gave the album a negative review, saying it possesses ""no sound of its own, just a shallow range between Linkin Park and Nickelback"". According to Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger, who gave the album three out of five stars, Life Starts Now continues the theme of One-X, Gontier's personal demons, but with a ""hint of sunlight"". He compliments the album, saying it ""treats the well-worn metal themes of anger, isolation, heartache, and redemption with the kind of begrudging respect they deserve, pumping out a competent flurry of fist-bump anthems and world-weary, midtempo rockers"".[32] Harsher negative reviews came from Ben Czajkowski from 411mania.com as he described the album as ""Boring, bland, trite, tired, tried, and true"".

The first single from the album, ""Break"", was released on September 1, 2009. Three Days Grace embarked on a 20-date Canadian tour lasting through November and December 2009.[36] They co-headlined a January–February 2010 tour of the US with Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf.
They embarked on a US headlining tour with support from Chevelle, and Adelitas Way starting on March 26, 2010 in Grand Rapids, Michigan and ending on April 16, 2010 in Springfield, Massachusetts.

Three Days Grace went on tour with Nickelback and Buckcherry on the Dark Horse Fall 2010 Tour. They toured with My Darkest Days starting in March 2011 in Seattle, Washington.[39] They also joined Avenged Sevenfold on their Spring ""Welcome to the Family"" tour in 2011.[citation needed] They toured with Avenged Sevenfold, Seether, Escape The Fate, and Bullet For My Valentine on the Rockstar Energy Drink Uproar tour from August 2011 to October 2011. It was their last album under Jive Records and their first album under Sony Music Entertainment after the Sony BMG joint venture ended, moving all former BMG labels to the new Sony Music Entertainment.


Transit of Venus and Gontier's departure (2012 - present) 

On October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, the band (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release their future material (including their upcoming fourth studio album) on the RCA Records brand.

On June 5, 2012, at 9:00 A.M. PST, the same day as Venus' visible transit across the sun, the band announced that their fourth studio album will be called Transit of Venus and that it is set to be released October 2, 2012. They created an early promotional video that was released on their website, featuring clips of them in the studio as well as footage of the physical transit of Venus. Due to the rarity of this occurrence, they created the slogan, ""some things will never happen again in your lifetime"", reflecting both this uncommon occurrence as well as the mood that the lyrics and music will most likely take on. The first single on the album, ""Chalk Outline"", was released August 14.

On January 9, 2013, Three Days Grace announced that Adam Gontier was resigning from the band. Brad's brother, Matt Walst of My Darkest Days, would be touring with the band as lead vocals. They cited Adam Gontier's sudden departure due to medical reasons.

Three Days Grace kicked off their 2013 tour in Moline, IL with Matt Walst as touring lead singer; instead of Adam Gontier. He is not an official member of Three Days Grace.

Musical style and influences

Three Days Grace's musical style has generally been described by critics as alternative metal and hard rock throughout the band's career. Heather Phares of Allmusic, in a review of the band's debut album, compared them to rock bands Chevelle and Helmet. Dave Doray of IGN described Three Days Grace as ""heavy and catchy, with chewy chunks of assurance and fury thrown in for added measure."" Allmusic's Corey Apar said One-X brings an ""accessible alt-metal attack of blunt lyrics and crunching rhythms"" that retains the melodic sound of its predecessor ""despite its lyrical darkness"".

The band has listed numerous influences in their music. Gontier has mentioned such bands as Sunny Day Real Estate, Kyuss, Nine Inch Nails, and Tool as influences for the band's music. According to Gontier, the lyrics for Three Days Grace songs have mostly been influenced by the Seattle music scene. He summarized about the band's influences in an interview, ""Musically there's a lot of different influences, but lyrically it's hard to have different influences because you just write.""

Mac DeMarco,"Mac DeMarco is the antithesis to your stereotypical singer-songwriter. Disregarding the seriously somber moments, he replaces them with whimsical and youthful spontaneity, whilst retaining endearing and subtle commentaries. Promptly after leaving his Edmonton garage for Vancouver he embarked on a grand voyage of enlightenment and alcoholic debauchery.

DeMarco’s a weird cat, cultivating an affinity for occult imagery, nudity and social satire. But his most impressive trait is his undeniable and instinctual ability to compose magical pop jangles, which he refers to as “jizz jazz.” His dusted jams have garnished him accolades that are as ever-increasing as his song-writing abilities. Mac's favorite artists are Shuggie Otis, Steely Dan, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Jonathan Richman and The Grateful Dead

DeMarco was born Vernor Winfield McBriare Smith IV on April 30, 1990, in Duncan, British Columbia. He was named after his great-grandfather, Vernor Smith (1864 - 1932), who was the Minister of Railways and Telephones in Edmonton. To spite his absentee father, DeMarco's mom Agnes changed his name to McBriare Samuel Lanyon DeMarco when he was five. Friends and family came to know him as ""Mac."" He grew up in Edmonton, the capital of Alberta. After high school, DeMarco moved to Vancouver. Calling himself Makeout Videotape, Mac released his debut tape in 2009, entitled Heat Wave.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+DeMarco"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Mogwai,"Mogwai are a band from Glasgow formed in 1995. They compose lengthy, mostly instrumental guitar-based pieces in the style of post-rock, usually focused around the elaboration of a single theme, and are known traditionally for their quiet/loud dynamic, defined bass riffs, and an eminent ambient sound, sometimes dark and sometimes grand. Although frequently referred to as post-rock, the band have revealed in interviews that they despise this categorization, insisting that their sound bears little resemblance to pioneers of the genre, such as Tortoise. 

The band were originally signed to renowned Glasgow indie label Chemikal Underground, but call a number of labels home, being distributed by different labels such as Matador in the United States and Play it again Sam Records in the United Kingdom. They have also developed their own label called Rock Action Records, named after guitarist Ron Asheton of The Stooges, who had his name changed to Rock Action.

Mogwai are named after the creatures from the film Gremlins (the word itself is Cantonese for 'ghost' or 'hunter' dependant on the semi or literal translation), although Braithwaite comments that ""it has no significant meaning and we always intended on getting a better one [name], but like a lot of other things we never got round to it."".

Their style has been influenced by such bands as The Cure, Joy Division, The Jesus & Mary Chain, Pixies, My Bloody Valentine, and post-rock granddaddies Slint. During 2004 the band were handed support slots on the tours of two of their heroes, the Pixies and The Cure. It has easily identifiable connections to genres like shoegaze, math rock, art rock, and occasionally instrumental metal. While Mogwai's sound bears little resemblance to punk rock, the band seems to identify closely with the punk ethic.

Mogwai's influence on the indie rock scene can be heard in the work of Explosions in the Sky, Italians Giardini di Mirò, Qatsi, and most other contemporary post-rock.

The fifth Mogwai album, Mr. Beast, was released in March 2006 and returned to the heavier sounds of 1997's Mogwai Young Team.  Mr. Beast saw Mogwai dropping most of their ""post-rock"" crescendoing with songs developing more like rock, with direct hooks and lyrics.

Mogwai produced the remix track of 'Plans' on the British group Bloc Party's 2005 album Silent Alarm Remixed.

In October 2006 Mogwai returned with a soundtrack to the documentary of global football star Zinedine Zidane called Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait,  released through their own label Rock Action. They have also released a soundtrack to Darren Aronofsky's 'The Fountain' in collaboration with Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet.

The Hawk is Howling was released in September 2008.

In February 2011 the band released their 7th Studio Album Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will. And, in July 2013, Mogwai performed their soundtrack to Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait for the first time at a number of dates across the UK. Shortly afterwards, on 5 August, the band revealed via Twitter that they were recording a new studio album at Castle of Doom Studios, released in early 2014 called Rave Tapes.

Chet Faker,"Chet Faker (born Nicholas James Murphy; 23 June 1988) is an electronica musician hailing from Melbourne, Australia.
Nick Murphy settled on the stage name Chet Faker as an homage to Chet Baker. Other influences he has cited include Bob Dylan, as well as his mother's Motown albums and his father's ""chilled out Ibiza CDs"".
He first rose to prominence after his cover of Blackstreet's ""No Diggity"" went viral online, reaching #1 on the Hypemachine chart in May 2011. He released his first EP Thinking In Textures in 2012 to positive reviews, being described as ""wonderfully loungey"" and praised for its ability to ""mix subtlety with impressive beauty"". The EP was also popular with fans, with single ""I'm Into You"" landing at number 24 on the 2012 Triple J Hottest 100 chart.
Faker has worked with several other artists since the release of his debut EP, including collaborations with Flume and remixes of songs by MS MR and The Temper Trap. He was a featured vocalist on Say Lou Lou's ""Fool of Me"", which was named Best New Track by Pitchfork in May 2013.
He released a new single featuring Kilo Kish on 12 August 2013. In September of 2013, Flume announced that he and Faker had recorded an EP, stating that the final result ""doesn't sound particularly like Flume or specifically like, you know, a Chet Faker record it really is kinda like a hybrid of both sounds going to one"" and he feels like everything they did with the EP ""was collaborative about the whole effort, and I think that shines through."" Faker's debut album, ""Built on Glass"", was released on 11 April 2014, which was preceded by the release of lead single ""Talk Is Cheap"" and its accompanying music video on February 11. The album debuted at number 1 on the ARIA Charts. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Chet+Faker"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Blondie,"Blondie is an American rock band founded in New York City in 1974 by singer-songwriter Deborah Harry and guitarist Chris Stein. The band was a pioneer in the early American new wave and punk scenes of the mid-70s, developing their sound in famous NYC clubs such as CBGBs. With hits such as ""Atomic"", ""Call Me"". ""Heart of Glass"", and ""Maria"" as well as sales of over 40 million records worldwide, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Their original lineup consisted of Deborah Harry (vocals), Chris Stein (guitar, bass guitar), Clem Burke (drums, percussion), Jimmy Destri (keyboards), and Gary Valentine (bass guitar, guitar). 

Band lore states that their name came from both a flippant reference to Adolf Hitler's dog Blondie as well as vocalist Harry's bright blond hair. Previously having been a Playboy Bunny, Harry fronted the early version of the band. initially known as ""Angel and the Snakes"". They built up underground fame in NYC. Blondie released their first album, 'Blondie', in 1976. The album was mildly successful and spawned the Australian hit single ""In The Flesh"". Gary Valentine left the band later that year, and they continued briefly as a foursome, recording 'Plastic Letters' and gaining more airplay with their track ""Denis"". Still in touch with their punk roots, having played in clubs such as CBGBs and hung out with rock artists such as the Ramones, the band broke out into other, more diverse influences such as older dance and pop music, particularly interested in Phil Spector's 'wall of sound' technique.

Valentine was replaced by Los Angeles-based musician Frank Infante (guitar, bass guitar) in 1977. Infante had already played guitar on one track on 'Plastic Letters'. The band went out playing live with Infante and Stein swopping between playing guitar and bass guitar throughout each concert. The band also added British born but LA-based Nigel Harrison (bass guitar), making Blondie a six piece group for the first time. Harrison was a former member of the glam rock band Silverhead.

In 1978, they released the album that would make them international stars, titled 'Parallel Lines'. The album spawned several hit singles, including the number one hit ""Heart Of Glass"", ""Sunday Girl"", ""Hanging On The Telephone"" (a cover of the famous power pop track by The Nerves), and ""One Way Or Another"". The success of the heavily disco influenced ""Heart of Glass"", a song sometimes censored for its use of strong language for the time and considered by the band as tongue-in-cheek, proved controversial among many fans of the band's punk background, but it managed to break them through at a massive level. 

They released three more albums (1979's Eat To The Beat, 1980's Autoamerican (containing the number one singles ""The Tide Is High"" and ""Rapture"") and 1982's The Hunter) as well as a number one single ""Call Me"", from the score of the 1980 film ""American Gigolo"".

In 1980, Harrison contributed several unused Blondie songs to ex-Silverhead singer Michael Des Barres solo album I'm Only Human. In 1981, Harry released a solo album Koo Koo, Destri released a solo album Heart On A Wall. Burke recorded and played live with the Eurythmics, and Stein started a record label named Animal Records.

In 1982, health problems for Stein, declining sales and inter-band tension caused the band to split. Harry kept a low profile for a few years while she nursed (now former) boyfriend Stein through a serious illness, but then continued a solo career as an actress/singer.

Reformation plans begun in 1997 with a line-up that included Harry, Stein, Destri, Burke, Valentine, and Harrison. Infante was not invited to the reunion. Valentine and Harrison were eventually (and unceremoniously, they claim) replaced by Paul Carbonara (guitar) and Leigh Foxx (bass).

The band released No Exit in 1998, which did quite well in both US and UK charts and contained the number one hit single ""Maria"".

The album did not include any song contributions from Valentine or Harrison, despite them recording early sessions for the album and Valentine being assured by Stein that they would use his already recorded song ""Amor Fati"". Harrison and Infante later filed an unsuccessful lawsuit claiming breach of contract for not including them in the reunion.

The Curse Of Blondie was released in 2003 and, while not matching its predecessor in sales, was critically acclaimed and spawned the global dance hit ""Good Boys"".

Destri retired from touring in 2004, but is still listed as a band member on their official web site. Kevin Patrick (keyboards), Destri's former keyboard tech and assistant, replaced him soon followed by Matt Katz-Bohen in 2008. 

The band's 2006 induction ceremony into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame was the scene of an awkward moment between Infante and Harry, during which he asked that the former members be allowed to play along with fellow inductees Harry, Stein and Burke during the band's set, since it was the original band that was being inducted. Harry replied ""Can't you see my band is up there?"" prompting Infante to counter ""I thought it was Blondie that was being inducted.""

In 2006, the band toured as the opening act for The New Cars on the ""Road Rage Tour."" Although Harry was more than 60 years old, the band still managed incendiary versions of their old hits, while playing with enough fire to remind the audience of their punk roots.

In 2007, the band embarked on a tour of Europe, to coincide with the DVD release of the first ever music video album ""Eat To The Beat"".

Harry has since resumed her solo career, releasing 2007's Necessary Evil.  

On June 5, 2008, Blondie commenced a world tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Parallel Lines with a concert at Ram's Head Live in Baltimore, Maryland. The tour covered some Eastern and Midwestern US cities throughout the month of June. In July, the tour took the band overseas to Israel, the UK, Russia, Europe and Scandinavia, wrapping up on August 2, 2008 at Rockefeller in Oslo, Norway.

Clem Burke and Paul Carbonara both recently told interviewers that the band is working on another record, which would be their first new album since the release of The Curse of Blondie in 2003. Carbonara described it as ""a real Blondie record.

Blondie undertook a North American tour of mid-sized venues with Pat Benatar and The Donnas in the summer of 2009. Following the tour, in October, the band began recording sessions for their ninth studio album with producer Jeff Saltzman in Woodstock, New York.  In December 2009, the band released the song ""We Three Kings"" to coincide with the Christmas holiday. 

The new album, to be titled Panic of Girls, which was being mixed at the time, was said to follow in 2010. Chris Stein stated that Dutch artist Chris Berens will provide the cover art. In April 2010, it was announced that guitarist Paul Carbonara had amicably left Blondie to pursue other projects and was replaced by Tommy Kessler. Panic of Girls is tentatively set to be released in 2010/2011.

In June 2010, Blondie began the first leg of a world tour named ""Endangered Species Tour"", which covered the United Kingdom and Ireland, supported by UK band Little Fish. The set lists featured both classics and new material from the forthcoming Panic of Girls. After a break in July the tour will resume in August and cover the United States and Canada over a course of six weeks. Blondie is then set to take the ""Endangered Species Tour"" to Australia and New Zealand in November and December. It was revealed that the bands album will be released on the Australian Sony label in November 2010, and elsewhere in January 2011.

Songfacts reports that Mother, the first single from Panic of Girls received its global premiere on BBC Radio on March 17th, 2011 and was made available for purchase on May 23, 2011. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Blondie"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Boards of Canada,"Boards of Canada are an electronic music duo from Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, formed in 1986 and comprised of brothers Mike Sandison (born 1 June 1970) and Marcus Eoin (born 21 July 1971). They have released a number of works, most notably the studio albums Music Has the Right to Children (1998), Geogaddi (2002), and The Campfire Headphase (2005) on the pioneering electronic music label Warp. Their fourth album Tomorrow's Harvest was released in June 2013.

Boards of Canada have had an enormous influence on the ambient, downtempo and IDM scenes. They have frequently made reference to the warm, scratchy, artificial sounds of 1970s television. Indeed, the Sandison brothers admit to being inspired by the documentary films of the National Film Board of Canada, from which they take their name. The duo have recorded a few minor works under the name Hell Interface. Boards of Canada’s music has been used in several CSI episodes and on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim interlude shorts; small bits of their music have been used on the BBC program Top Gear for transitional music.

Early Boards of Canada (1970s-1995)

Growing up in a musical family, brothers Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin began playing instruments at a young age. They experimented with recording techniques at around the age of 10, using tape machines to layer cut-up samples of found sounds over compositions of their own. In their teens they participated in a number of amateur bands, however, it wasn't until 1986 when Marcus was invited to Mike’s band that Boards of Canada was born.

By 1989, the band had been reduced to Sandison, Eoin and Christopher Horne. In the early 1990s, a number of collaborations took place and the band put on small, fairly regular shows among the “Hexagon Sun” collective.

In early 2000, the official website for the band, Music70.com (now boardsofcanada.com) removed the early discography of Boards of Canada, although some information has been preserved by fans. Early tape releases by Boards of Canada include ""Play by Numbers"", ""Acid Memories"", ""Hooper Bay"", and the earliest known release by the band is titled ""Catalog 3"". None of the material from those days is readily available, and since official Boards of Canada sources ignore the existence of this material, there seems to be little chance for this early material to ever resurface.

Boards of Canada from Twoism (1995-present)

In 1995, the band released the first work from the Hexagon Sun studio, the EP ""Twoism"". Like earlier Music70 releases, it was produced in a self-financed limited run and was privately distributed, primarily to friends and labels. Unlike previous releases though, a small number of copies were also released to the public through the IDM mailing list. Though not a widespread commercial release, it was considered of such high quality to be subsequently re-pressed in 2002 and serves as a demarcation point into more professional releases.

The precursor to ""Music Has the Right to Children"" was released in 1996. Titled ""Boc Maxima"", it was a semi-private release that is notable for being a full-length album. Boc Maxima’s work was later used for ""Music Has the Right to Children"", with which it shares many tracks.

Boards of Canada’s first commercial release occurred after attracting the attention of Autechre’s Sean Booth of the English label Skam Records, one of many people sent a demo EP. Skam released what was considered Boards of Canada’s first ""findable"" work, ""Hi Scores"", in 1996.

""Music Has the Right to Children"" was released in 1998. Many fans consider this record to be a masterpiece. The popularity of the record was substantial enough to start a wave of sound-alikes.

John Peel featured Boards of Canada on his BBC Radio 1 program in January of 1998. The session featured two remixes from ""Music Has the Right to Children"" — ""PlayAquarius (Version 3)"" and ""PlayOlson (Version 3)"" — along with the tracks ""Happy Cycling"" and “XYZ”. Excluding “XYZ”, the set was released on a Warp Records CD titled ""Peel Session TX 21/07/1998"".

Though never an actively touring band, Boards of Canada did perform a handful of shows. Early shows saw them supporting Warp label-mates Seefeel and Autechre in a scattering of UK dates. They also participated in a few festivals and multi-artist bills, including two Warp parties: Warp’s 10th Anniversary Party in 1999 and The Incredible Warp Lighthouse Party almost one year later. They made their most prominent showing in 2001 as one of the headliners at the Tortoise-curated All Tomorrow’s Parties festival. They have not performed a live show since.

Boards of Canada released a four-track EP, ""In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country"", in November 2000, their first original release in two years.

The full-length album ""Geogaddi"" was released in 2002. It was described by Sandison as ”a record for some sort of trial-by-fire, a claustrophobic, twisting journey that takes you into some pretty dark experiences before you reach the open air again.”

Throughout most of their career, Mike and Marcus chose not to publicize their brotherhood and were simply portrayed as childhood friends. Their kinship was finally revealed in a 2005 Pitchfork interview. Mike explained that they concealed the fact to avoid comparisons to Orbital, another well-known UK electronic group composed of two brothers.

Their third album for Warp Records, ""The Campfire Headphase"", was released on 17 October 2005. The album covers much of the same musical territory as their previous works and featured fifteen tracks, including “Peacock Tail”, “Chromakey Dreamcoat”, and “Dayvan Cowboy”. Two versions of “Dayvan Cowboy” — the original and a remix by Odd Nosdam — are on the six-track EP, ""Trans Canada Highway"", which was released on 26 May 2006.

Sound and methods

Brief songs or “vignettes” feature prominently in their music. Such songs are often weaving melodies or speech accompanied by atmospherics to capture a specific moment or mood. They often last less than two minutes, but, as Sandison says, “those short tracks you mention, we write far more of those than the so-called ‘full on’ tracks, and in a way, they are our own favorites”.

Boards of Canada have written an enormous number of song fragments and songs, most of which will never be released. It does not appear that music is made exclusively for commercial release. Rather, albums seem to be the result of selecting complementary songs from current work, which is a compositional technique shared by many electronic or experimental artists such as Nightmares on Wax, Canabrism and King Crimson. Geogaddi’s development involved the creation of 400 song fragments and 64 complete songs, of which 23 were selected, one of which is silence.

Subliminal messages, symbolism, and religion

Marcus and Mike have both expressed a strong interest in the power of subliminal messaging and their work is full of cryptic messages.

Some critics refuse to listen to their music on account that they are positive the band is trying to brainwash their listeners for unknown motivations, citing references to David Koresh and occult symbols as proof. Others approach these facts from the skeptical angle, saying it is nothing but a bunch of “cute tricks” and an ironic gesture towards people who take such things seriously (and some would say, as a bit of a similar gesture towards their own body of work in later releases, such as ""Geogaddi""). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Devendra Banhart,"Devendra Obi Banhart (born May 30, 1981) is a Venezuelan American singer-songwriter and visual artist. Banhart was born in Houston, Texas and was raised by his mother in Venezuela, until he moved to California as a teenager. His first few records were released on the Young God Records label from New York City.  His most recent CD was released by Nonesuch. He is one of the most popular artists to come out of the ""New Weird America"" movement, which includes performers such as Faun Fables, Viking Moses, Jack Rose, Jana Hunter, Arborea, The MV & EE Medicine Show, Currituck Co., Six Organs of Admittance, and The Royal We, among others. He also often joins the band known as Vetiver.

Banhart is considered to have an eclectic style, with many of his songs seemingly following a stream-of-consciousness vein, being hard to decipher and non-literal. His music tends to consist of fairly simple guitar melodies with minimal other instrumentation, and his lyrical themes are often surreal and naturalistic. His involvement in the Los Angeles artist community is reflected in Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, released in September 2007. He gained some underground notoriety in New York for performing several of his early shows with underwear on his head for the duration of the performance.

Banhart's most recent tour of the United States saw him perform with his full band, which is currently known as Power Mineral. Power Mineral included Andy Cabic (Vetiver), Greg Rogove (Priestbird), Noah Georgeson, Luckey Remington, Pete Newsom, Otto Hauser (Vetiver, Currituck Co., Espers, Nick Castro), Kevin Barker (Currituck Co.), and others. The band claims to rechristen itself when a name comes to them, and has previously been known as Fried Hummingbird, Vagina Burglars, Hairy Fairy Band, Las Putas Locas, Stoner Boner, Spiritual Boner, Bummer Hummer, Brain Taint, Love Fart, Bathhouse Of The Winds, and First Woman Millionaire among other names.

Banhart was discovered by Michael Gira of Swans, who released his Oh Me Oh My... The Way the Day Goes by the Sun Is Setting Dogs Are Dreaming… album on his own Young God Records label in 2002. In 2005, Banhart (along with Andy Cabic and Revolver USA) created the Gnomonsong record label. In 2006 he helped to curate an edition of the British All Tomorrow's Parties festival.

Banhart also was one of the younger musicians responsible for ""rediscovering"" the music of folksinger Vashti Bunyan. Bunyan is a guest vocalist on his album Rejoicing in the Hands. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Devendra+Banhart"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Grizzly Bear,"Grizzly Bear is a rock band from Brooklyn, New York. Their music uses melody and ambience in conjunction with hazy-eyed choruses, whistles, piano, banjo, and several woodwind instruments.

Grizzly Bear was originally the solo project of Edward Droste (vocals/guitar), who recorded his debut album Horn of Plenty at home.  The record was originally meant for his friends, but it eventually circulated and got a proper release in 2004, this time with the help of Christopher Bear (drums/vocals).  A re-release with a bonus disc of remixes was issued in 2005.

2005 also saw the addition of the two other band members, Chris Taylor  (woodwinds/electronics/engineering/production) and Daniel Rossen (vocals/guitar). Playing as a four piece allowed the complexity of sound that was recorded on Horn of Plenty to be played live. The band toured throughout the year, playing songs off the first album as well as some of the new songs they were collectively writing that would make up Yellow House. 

An album of Droste's early demo recordings, Sorry for the Delay, was released in 2006.  Later that year they signed to Warp to release Yellow House on September 4th, 2006, to great acclaim.

In 2007, the band released Friend EP, which features outtakes, alternate versions, and covers done by CSS, Band of Horses, and Atlas Sound. In addition, members of the Dirty Projectors and Beirut collaborated with the band on ""Alligator"" and the EP's hidden track.

The band released their third full length album,  Veckatimest, on May 26, 2009. After extensive touring, the band took a six month hiatus and then reconvened to record in Marfa, Texas and Cape Cod and released their fourth full length album, Shields, on September 18, 2012. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Grizzly+Bear"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Motörhead,"Motörhead were a British heavy metal band formed in London, UK in 1975 by bassist, singer and songwriter Ian Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945 – 28 December 2015), known mostly by his stage name Lemmy, who has remained the sole constant member. The band pre-dated, but are sometimes regarded as part of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Motörhead is also regarded as, with Judas Priest and Accept, one of the first Speed Metal bands.

Motörhead are typically classified as heavy metal, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Lemmy dislikes such labels, preferring to describe the band's music simply as ""rock 'n' roll"" and usually opening live shows with the line ""We are Motörhead. We play rock and roll."" Usually a power trio, Motörhead had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as one of Britain's foremost rock bands.

Motörhead's approach has remained the same over the band's career, preferring to play what they enjoy and do best; their appreciation of early rock and roll is reflected in some of their occasional cover songs. Motörhead's lyrics typically cover such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and ""life on the road"". The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, War-Pig (AKA Snaggletooth), with its oversized boar's horns, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums.

Damien Rice,"Damien Rice (born December 7, 1973) is an Irish singer-songwriter. He was born in Dublin, Ireland, to George and Maureen Rice and was raised in Celbridge, County Kildare, Ireland. In March 1999 Damien moved to Tuscany, then travelled around Europe, busking the streets. He arrived back in Dublin a year later, with a clear head and full of ideas. Damien started playing and recording music with his first band, Juniper. After a few years he decided creatively it was not for him so he left the band (Newly named Bell X1) to start a solo career.

He approached his music with a new found freshness and decided to put some songs down on record. His grandmother told him he had a distant cousin in London in the music business.  Borrowing money from those that would lend it, he recorded his demo and sent it off to his cousin, renowned producer and film composer, David Arnold (Bjork, James Bond). Arnold liked what he heard and provided enough money for Damien to buy his own mobile studio.

Damien Rice formerly sang with Lisa Hannigan and released his debut solo album, O, in Ireland in early 2002. In July 2002 O was released in the UK and it received widespread critical acclaim. In June 2003 O was released in the USA and Europe, with Rice appearing on The Letterman Show and receiving more acclaim from publications such as Rolling Stone, Newsweek and The Boston Globe.  Arnold joined him on stage in New York to perform a version of the Björk/Arnold track Play Dead.
He gained further popularity after some of his most famous songs were included in the media. An example of this is 9 Crimes used in the soundtrack of the summer blockbuster Shrek Three and The Blower's Daughter was featured in the movie Closer. Delicate was also featured in the hit T.V. show Lost.

Damien Rice is an intense live act - with emphasis laid on emotional intensity and experiments, rather than technical perfection. At a 2005 concert, for instance, he threw out big cheeses to the audience. This can sometimes be more demanding for the listener than the radio hit edit of the song Cannonball suggests.  'Cannonball' was re-mixed in 2004, for UK radio, to make it more radio-friendly. Rice later was reported to be very unhappy with it, saying to Tom Dunne on PetSounds (Today FM) that he did not ""...really like it"". He stated that he had allowed the remix to go through only if he signed a contract that would forbid anyone from ever remixing one of his songs ever again.

Damien spent 2004 and 2005 recording the follow-up to O. The album, 9, was released in Ireland on November 3, 2006, on November 6 in the rest of Europe, and in North America on November 14, 2006. Even though the new album maintained Rice's sense of ""emotionality,"" some argued that it did so through volume and intensity rather than with the reflection and lyrical commentary that characterized his first release, O.

Rice has also developed a reputation as a live performer, selling out at venues across Europe and the United States. He is a performer who gives a lot of himself to the audience.

As of March 25th, 2007, this was posted on the Damien Rice official website: After much thought and discussion Damien has decided that his professional relationship with Lisa Hannigan has run its creative course. As a result Lisa will not be appearing at any of the upcoming live shows. Lisa is embarking on her own artistic endeavours and there are no plans for them to work together in the foreseeable future. The current band on tour at the moment are - Damien Rice, Joel Shearer, Shane Fitzsimons, Tom Osander, and Vyvienne Long.

Rumors that Damien Rice is currently dating Mélanie Laurent, a French actress, has not been verified.  However, there have been reports that he is working with the actress to record her debut album. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Rice"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lukas Graham,"Lukas Graham is a Danish pop band consisting of vocalist Lukas Graham Forchhammer (born September 18, 1988), drummer Mark ""Lovestick"" Falgren (born November 28, 1988), bassist Magnus Larsson (born September 9, 1990) and keyboardist Kasper Daugaard (born June 14, 1989). 

Launching their debut album in 2012 on Copenhagen Records, Lukas Graham quickly became a popular live act in Denmark. That success translated to the rest of Europe and caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records who co-signed them in 2013. The band’s music was first introduced worldwide with the release of their two singles ""Mama Said"" and ""7 Years"", the latter of which topped various international charts. Their second album was released internationally on April 1. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lukas+Graham"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Belle and Sebastian,"Belle and Sebastian is a band from Glasgow. Led by guitarist/vocalist Stuart Murdoch, the seven-piece band has an intimate, majestic sound that is equal parts folk-rock and '60s pop. Murdoch has a gift not only for whimsy and surrealism, but also for odd, unsettling lyrical detail which keeps the songs grounded in a tangible reality. 

Based in Glasgow, Scotland, Belle and Sebastian released their first two albums in 1996: Tigermilk, recorded over three days, and If You're Feeling Sinister, recorded in a week, at the peak of the chamber pop movement. At first, some critics in Britain's music weeklies tied the band into the subgenre, yet the group was too pretty, too delicate, to bear that label. Through their first two years of public existence, the band shielded their personalities, submitting publicity photos featuring a girl, who was a friend of the band and reluctantly posing for photo shoots. Furthermore, they performed in odd venues, playing not only the standard coffeehouses and cafes, but also homes, church halls, and libraries.

Prior to the formation of Belle and Sebastian, Murdoch suffered from a protracted battle with chronic fatigue syndrome, which forced him to drop out of school and spend seven years living in his parents' home crippled by his condition.Whilst in his parents home, Murdoch wrote a short story about a boy named Sebastian and a girl named Isabelle  based on the names from Madame Cecile Aubery's children's book Belle et Sebastian. On New Year's Day 1996, Stuart attended a party at which he met a young singer and cellist named Isobel Campbell. In a letter to his brother Fraser, Murdoch explained how he was making a single for Stow college at the end of February. Murdoch opted to use the name Belle&Sebastian for the project because it was occupying him at the time.  Murdoch took to songwriting as an escapism from the four walls surrounding him in his room and eventually recorded demos with bassist Stuart David whom he met at a government training programme called Beatbox. Murdoch quickly met a series of other musicians through social and musical circles in his hometown Glasgow and they agreed to help with the Stow project. The members he found for this initial lineup were Stevie Jackson (guitar), Mick Cooke (trumpet), Chris Geddes (keyboards), Stuart David (bass), Richard Colburn (drums), and Isobel Campbell (cello). The Stow College record was to be issued by Electric Honey, but it turned into a full album. The course instructor Alan Rankine determined that Murdoch had enough good material to record a full LP and could do so if they could get it all done in three days, studio time allotted for the single. Murdoch and his musicians rose to the challenge and recorded ten tracks putting the songs in order as they would appear on the record and mostly completing them in just a few takes. 

In May of 1996, Belle and Sebastian self-released their debut album, Tigermilk, on Electric Honey Records. Only 1,000 copies of the album, which was only pressed on vinyl, were released, but it unexpectedly became a sensation, earning terrific word of mouth throughout the UK. As a result, the band became slightly more than a school project — it became an actual band. If You're Feeling Sinister, released on the independent Jeepster label, followed in November of 1996. By the time the album was released in America on the EMI subsidiary The Enclave, it had earned considerable critical acclaim in the U.K. — not only from music weeklies, but from newspapers like The Sunday Times and magazines like The Face — and a large cult following; by some accounts, Tigermilk was being sold for as much as 75 pounds. Over the course of 1997, word of mouth continued to grow in America, even as the band pulled out of an American tour because The Enclave went bankrupt and closed.

As the band cult continued to build in 1997, Belle and Sebastian released three EPs — Dog on Wheels (May), Lazy Line Painter Jane (July), and 3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light (October). Each subsequent EP placed higher on the indie charts and received great critical acclaim. Later in the year, violinist Sarah Martin became a member of the band. By the end of the year, the group finalized an American deal with Matador Records, issuing The Boy With the Arab Strap in September 1998. The following year saw the eagerly anticipated wide re-release of Tigermilk, the album that started it all. It was the biggest selling album but is unpopular with the group themselves. Following completion of 2000's Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant, Stuart David left Belle and Sebastian to focus full-time on his solo project, Looper, being replaced by Bobby Kildea of V-Twin. In 2001, the group released two EPs — Jonathan David and I'm Waking Up to Us — and recorded the soundtrack for Todd Solondz's film Storytelling. Just before the soundtrack's release in spring 2002, Belle and Sebastian embarked on a comprehensive tour of the United States and Canada before returning to Europe for the summer festival season. Midway through the tour, Isobel Campbell left the band, citing the usual differences. 

Another major change that soon took place was the band leaving Jeepster and Matador to sign with Rough Trade, with their next record, late 2003's Dear Catastrophe Waitress, produced by the inimitable Trevor Horn (who also produced Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Yes, and scores of others). The record spawned the brilliant ""Step into My Office, Baby"" and ""I'm a Cuckoo"" singles, the latter of which was the group's biggest U.K. hit, reaching number 14 in early 2004. After a long worldwide tour that found Belle and Sebastian reaching new levels of success, they retired to Scotland and began preparing for the recording of their seventh full length album, The Life Pursuit, released in 2006. 
In 2010, they released their eighth full length album, Write About Love.

ScHoolboy Q,"Quincey Matthew Hanley (born October 26, 1986), better known by his stage name ScHoolboy Q is an American recording hip hop artist from Los Angeles, California. Hanley is signed to Top Dawg Entertainment and is a member of Black Hippy along with Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar and Ab-Soul. In 2008, ScHoolboy Q released his first mixtape titled, ScHoolboy Turned Hustla and followed up in 2009 with Gangsta & Soul. In 2011, he finally released his first album titled, Setbacks. Later ScHoolboy Q released his sophomore album titled, Oxymoron in early 2014. Oxymoron was also nominated for Rap Album of The Year. 

Dividing his time between socially conscious rap and bud smoker’s anthems, ScHoolboy Q makes quite the impression on his debut “street album”: the polished, funky, well-balanced, and rewarding Setbacks. Think Mos Def meets Murs on an especially hazy, West Coast weekend and you’ve got the idea, but this ScHoolboy offers some unique ideas on top of it. He’s a complex, mature young man who worries about his kids consuming too much fast food (the straight forward “Figg Get Da Money”) but he’s also a dude who can’t help letting go, diving headfirst into a bong when work is done (the dreamlike “Light Years Ahead”). “What’s the Word” with fellow Black Hippy member Jay Rock, is a radio-friendly number that deserves a lavish party video while the following “iBETiGOTSUMWEED” is the kind of looped, scratchy soul the Madlib and Stones Throw crowd crave. Talented on either end of the spectrum, ScHoolboy Q delivers both with the same skill and cool head, all while keeping his own identity up front. Setbacks wants to come off as just slightly more important than a mixtape, but this casual release is a big contribution to the “true hip-hop” movement.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/ScHoolboy+Q"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

AlunaGeorge,"AlunaGeorge are an English electronic music duo from London, consisting of Aluna Francis (vocals and songwriting) and George Reid (production and instrumentation).The duo first met in June 2009, when Reid remixed Francis' band My Toys Like Me's track ""Sweetheart""

A lot of bands meet as kids at school. Others come together after an over-enthusiastic conversation about music at some random party. Aluna Francis and George Reid however, met through the internet.

While their online encounter is more MySpace than Match.com, it was in fact through a mutual respect for each other's work that led them to go on to form AlunaGeorge. Now together for just barely a year, the talented duo have been churning out a series of infectious mixes which fuse Francis' sweet vocal harmonies with the hushed electronic stylings courtesy of Reid.

Having already caught the attention of Rob da Bank who championed their initial collaboration Sweetheart on Radio 1; they've since succeeded in initially tapping the American market having had a track featured in the US series of Skins earlier this year. Now this month sees the release of their debut AA single Analyser/ We Are Chosen, two impressively mastered melodies of sensual synths complemented by Francis' contagious vocals which evoke notions of the likes of Shanks and Bigfoot, yet at the same time remain utterly unique. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/AlunaGeorge"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

ABBA,"ABBA was a pop music group that formed in Stockholm, Sweden in November 1970. The band consisted of Anni-Frid Lyngstad (Frida), Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Agnetha Fältskog. 

They topped the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982 with eight studio albums, achieving twenty-six #1 singles and numerous awards. They also won the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with ""Waterloo"".

A jukebox musical based on the music of ABBA titled Mamma Mia! opened in London's West End in 1999 and has since become one of the most popular musicals in the world. In 2008, a movie version was made with Meryl Streep among the cast.

The recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2010 Induction Ceremony, held on March 15 in New York, recognized the huge contribution of ABBA. Represented by Anni-Frid Lyngstad ""Frida"" and former husband/band member Benny Andersson, it was perhaps the crowning acknowledgment of the phenomenal success of Sweden's most famous four.

D.R.A.M.,"Rapper, singer, and producer D.R.A.M. dropped his #1 Epic Summer mixtape in 2014, but he was off by a year, as it was the Beyoncé-assisted summer of 2015 that turned out to be epic.

Ozzy Osbourne,"John Michael ""Ozzy"" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English heavy metal vocalist, songwriter, and television personality. Osbourne rose to prominence in the early 1970s as the lead vocalist of the pioneering band Black Sabbath, whose dark and heavy sound has often been cited as key to the development of the heavy metal genre. Osbourne left Black Sabbath in 1979 and has since had a successful solo career, releasing 11 studio albums, the first seven of which were all awarded multi-platinum certifications in the US, though he has reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions, most recently in 2011 to record the album 13, which was released in 2013. Osbourne's longevity and success have earned him the informal title of ""Godfather of Heavy Metal"".

Osbourne's total album sales from his years in Black Sabbath combined with his solo work is over 100 million. As a member of Black Sabbath he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame as both a solo artist and as a member of the band. He has a star on the Birmingham Walk of Stars in his hometown, and also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In the early 2000s, he became a TV star, appearing as himself in the MTV reality program The Osbournes, alongside wife/manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ozzy+Osbourne"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Beirut,"Beirut is an American indie-rock and world music band which was originally the solo musical project of  Zach Condon (born Zachary Francis Condon in Santa Fe, New Mexico) and later expanded into a band. The band's first performances were in New York, in May 2006, to support the release of their debut album, Gulag Orkestar.

Condon recorded before Beirut was established: when he was fifteen and under the name of Realpeople, he made an electronic record, fashioned after his love for The Magnetic Fields. Condon was a straight-A student until he dropped out at the age of 17 to travel Europe with his cousin in a drunken haze, cavorting and partying with the locals wherever he ended up. It was during one of these evenings that he was first exposed to Balkan music (notably including the Boban Marković Orkestar and Goran Bregović), blasting from the upstairs apartment. Condon ended up with the Serbian artists all night, going through albums country by country, note for note. 

The first album under the Beirut moniker, Gulag Orkestar (2006), was the direct result of what he learned that night. While it may sound like an entire Balkan orchestra playing modern songs as mournful ballads and upbeat marches, the album was performed and recorded almost entirely by Condon alone. He did so on Pro Tools while skipping school in Albuquerque and at Sea Side Studios in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Jeremy Barnes added percussion and some violin overlays.

After recording, Condon formed a full band which at times varies in the number of members, from six to ten. Live he is accompanied by Perrin Cloutier (cello/accordion), Jason Poranski (guitar/mandolin/ukulele), Nick Petree (drums), Kristin Ferebee (violin), Paul Collins (organ/keys/tambourine/ukulele), Jon Natchez (baritone sax/mandolin/glockenspiel), and Kelly Pratt (trumpet/euphonium).

In November 2006 Condon was ""briefly hospitalized for extreme exhaustion"", the band's website said, and as a consequence the band cancelled the rest of the tour. They resumed performing in March 2007 and released their second album, The Flying Club Cup the same year on October 9th. Parts of the album were performed and recorded by Condon in his bedroom again, but others were recorded with the live band, which resulted in a more organic, live sound. While writing, Condon said he was inspired by French music, like Jacques Brel (whose song Le Moribond he covered on his Elephant Gun EP), and he moved to Paris for a while. During the extensive tour in support of The Flying Club Cup, Condon and the band more or less fell apart from exhaustion once again and disappeared from the radar in April 2008. 

Condon took a long break and returned in 2009 with a double EP, March of the Zapotec & Realpeople: Holland. The first was partly recorded in Mexico with the Mexican Band Jimenez and had a more South-American flavour to it than Condon's previous efforts. The second EP 'Holland' was credited to Condon's old name Realpeople and consisted of five electrotracks, once more in the vein of The Magnetic Fields.

The band's album ""The Rip Tide"" was released in 2011.

John Lennon,"John Winston Ono Lennon (9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English musician, singer, songwriter, and peace activist, born in Liverpool, UK who gained worldwide fame as a founding member of The Beatles. With Paul McCartney, Lennon formed one of the most influential and successful songwriting partnerships of the 20th century and ""wrote some of the most popular music in rock and roll history"". He is ranked the second most successful songwriter in UK singles chart history after Paul McCartney. 

Lennon revealed a rebellious nature, and biting wit, in his music, on film, in books, and at press conferences and interviews. He was controversial through his work as a peace activist and artist. After The Beatles, Lennon enjoyed a successful solo career (that started in 1968, 2 years before the break-up of The Beatles) with such acclaimed albums as John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine and iconic songs such as ""Give Peace a Chance"" and ""Imagine"". After a self-imposed ""retirement"" to raise his son, Lennon reemerged with a comeback album, Double Fantasy, but was murdered less than one month after its release. The album would go on to win the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.

As of 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States exceeded 14 million and, as writer, co-writer or performer, he is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart. In 2002, a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth and, in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

He is the father of Julian Lennon and Sean Lennon. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Bee Gees,"The Bee Gees, originally made up of three brothers: Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb (died 2012), and Maurice Gibb (died 2003), have been successful for most of their 40-plus years of recording music. They had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a pop act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as a foremost act of the disco music era in the late 1970s.

The Gibb brothers were born on the Isle of Man, UK to English parents in 1946 (Barry Alan Crompton Gibb, September 1) and 1949 ( twins Robin Hugh Gibb and Maurice (pronounced ""Morris"") Ernest Gibb, December 22). The family returned to father Hugh Gibb's home town of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England in the early 1950s where the boys began to sing in harmony, debuting in public on one memorable occasion at a local cinema. The boys were going to lip sync to a record, which other children had done at the cinema in previous weeks. However, on the way to the cinema, the record was dropped and broken. As a result, the brothers got on stage and sang themselves. They got a very good response from the crowd, which convinced them that singing was what they wanted to do with their lives.

In 1958, the Gibb family, including infant brother Andy (born March 5, 1958 in Manchester), emigrated to Redcliffe, Queensland, Australia, and and went to Humpybong State School. The still very young brothers began performing where they could to raise pocket change. First called the Rattlesnakes, later Wee Johnny Hayes & the Bluecats, and even Les Tosseurs, they were introduced to radio DJ Bill Gates (not to be confused with the founder of Microsoft) by racetrack promoter Bill Goode (who saw them perform at Brisbane's Speedway Circus). Gates renamed them after his and Goode's initials – thus the name was not simply a reference to the brothers Gibb.
By 1960, the Bee Gees were featured on television shows, and in the next few years began working regularly at resorts on the Queensland coast. Barry drew the attention of Australian star Col Joye for his songwriting, and Joye helped the boys get a record deal with Festival Records in 1963 under the name ""Bee Gees."" The three released two or three singles a year, while Barry supplied additional songs to other Australian artists.
A minor hit in 1965, ""Wine and Women,"" led to the group's first LP Barry Gibb and the Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs. By late 1966, the family decided to return to England, and seek their musical fortunes there. Whilst at sea in January, 1967, they heard that ""Spicks and Specks"", a song they had recorded in 1966, had gone to #1 in Australia.

1960s in England
The act's arrival in England in January 1967 was not immediately propitious, as they were advised ""Groups are out."" However, the Bee Gees were signed soon after their arrival by Robert Stigwood, and added Australian musicians Vince Melouney (guitar) and former child actor Colin Petersen (drums). Their first single recorded in England was ""New York Mining Disaster 1941"" (1967), a surreal, haunting and macabre composition that made the Top 20 on both sides of the Atlantic. Robert Stigwood boldly claimed that the Bee Gees were ""the most significant new musical talent of 1967"". Their album Bee Gees' 1st scored well with critics and the public, offering an innovative blend of rock and orchestral ballads such as the charting ""To Love Somebody"" and the well-regarded ""I Can't See Nobody.""
The next big single was ""Massachusetts,"" which launched the trio into stardom, followed shortly by the followup ""Words"". 1968 saw the release of two albums, ""Horizontal"" and ""Idea."" The latter contained two more hits, ""I've Gotta Get a Message to You"" and ""I Started a Joke."" To some critics and fans, these tracks represent the band's golden years, well before any of their ubiquitous disco hits.
The Bee Gees' next release was Odessa (1969), a dense and complex prog rock album with orchestral accompaniment. By this time, Barry and Robin were increasingly at odds about the creative direction of the group. Once Robert Stigwood made clear that he preferred to promote Barry as the act's leader, Robin left. Barry and Maurice released an LP as a duo, Cucumber Castle (the soundtrack to a television special), which contained the #2 UK hit ""Don't Forget to Remember."" Meanwhile, Robin released a solo album, Robin's Reign, which included his #2 UK hit ""Saved by the Bell.""

Early 1970s
The three brothers reunited in the later part of 1970, their feelings about the split evident in many songs about heartache and loneliness. Although they had lost traction on the British charts, the Bee Gees hit #3 in America with ""Lonely Days"" (from the reunion LP 2 Years On) and had their first U.S. #1 with ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?"" (from Trafalgar). In 1972, they hit #16 with ""Run to Me"" from the LP To Whom It May Concern; the single also returned them to the British top ten for the first time in three years.
By 1973, however, the Bee Gees were in a rut. The album, Life in a Tin Can, and its lead-off single, ""Saw a New Morning,"" sold poorly with the single peaking at #94. This was followed by an unreleased album (known as A Kick in the Head Is Worth Eight in the Pants).
On the advice of Ahmet Ertegun of their U.S. label Atlantic Records, Stigwood arranged for the group to record with famed soul music producer Arif Mardin. The resulting LP, Mr. Natural, included few ballads and foreshadowed the R&B direction of the rest of their career. But when it too failed to attract much interest, Mardin encouraged them to work with the soul music style.
The brothers attempted to assemble a live stage band that could replicate their studio sound. Lead guitarist Alan Kendall had come on board in 1971, but didn't have much to do until Mr Natural. For that album, they added drummer Dennis Bryon, and they later added ex-Strawbs keyboard player Blue Weaver, completing the late 1970s ""Bee Gees band"". Maurice, who'd previously performed on piano, guitar, organ, mellotron, and bass guitar, as well as exotica like mandolin and Moog, now confined himself to bass.
At Eric Clapton's suggestion, the brothers relocated to Miami, Florida early in 1975 to record. After starting off with ballads, they eventually heeded the urging of Mardin and Stigwood and crafted more rhythmic songs like ""Jive Talkin'"" and ""Nights on Broadway."" The latter featured Barry Gibb's first attempts at singing falsetto, in the backing vocals toward the end. The band liked the resulting new sound, and this time the public agreed, sending the LP Main Course (album) up the charts. Barry Gibb's falsetto would become a staple of subsequent recordings. Mardin was unable to work with the group afterwards, but the Bee Gees enlisted Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson who'd worked with Mardin during the Main Course sessions. This production team would carry the Bee Gees through the rest of the 1970s.
The next album, Children of the World, was drenched in Barry's new-found falsetto and Blue's synthesizer dance licks. Led off by the single ""You Should Be Dancing,"" it pushed the Bee Gees to a level of stardom they had not previously achieved in the USA, though the new disco sound was not as popular with some diehard fans from the 1960s. The stereotype of disco was canned, fabricated music, but the Bee Gees' band was closer to a rock act, with rhythm guitar and real drums behind the falsetto.

Late 1970s: Saturday Night Fever
 ""Saturday Night Fever"", became the number one best-selling soundtrack of all time, selling over 40 million of copies. 
Following a successful live album, Here at Last...The Bee Gees...Live, The Bee Gees agreed to participate in the creation of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. It was the turning point of their career. The cultural impact of both the film and the soundtrack was tremendous not only in the United States but in the world, bringing the nascent disco scene into the mainstream.
Three Bee Gees singles (""How Deep Is Your Love"", ""Stayin' Alive"", and ""Night Fever"") reached #1 in the United States and in most countries around the world, launching the most popular period of the disco era. They also penned the song ""If I Can't Have You"" which became a #1 hit for Yvonne Elliman. Such was the popularity of Saturday Night Fever that two different versions of the song ""More Than a Woman"" received airplay, one by The Bee Gees, which was the B-side of ""Stayin' Alive,"" and another by Tavares, which was the hit. The Gibb' sound was inescapable. During an eight-month period beginning in the Christmas season of 1977, the brothers wrote six songs that held the #1 position on the U.S. charts for 25 of 32 consecutive weeks-- three under their own name, two for brother Andy Gibb, and the Yvonne Elliman single.
Fueled by the movie's success, the album broke multiple records, becoming the highest-selling album in recording history to that point. Saturday Night Fever has since sold circa 40 million copies worldwide [1], making it the best selling soundtrack album of all time.
During this era, Barry and Robin wrote ""Emotion"" for Samantha Sang, who made it a Top Ten hit (the Bee Gees sang back-up vocals). A year later, Barry wrote the title song to the movie version of the Broadway musical Grease for Frankie Valli to perform, which went to #1. At one time, five songs written by the brothers Gibb were in the U.S. top ten at the same time. It was the first time this kind of chart dominance had been seen ever.
The three Bee Gees also co-starred with Peter Frampton in the movie Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band loosely inspired by the classic Beatles album released in 1967. The film had been heavily promoted prior to release, and was expected to enjoy great commercial success. However, the disjointed film was savaged by the movie critics, and ignored by the public, while the accompanying soundtrack was the biggest flop of that year, with hundreds of thousands of records being returned by retailers for credit.

During this period, the Bee Gees' younger brother Andy followed his older siblings into a music career, and enjoyed considerable success. Produced by Barry, Andy Gibb's first three singles all topped the U.S. charts.
The Bee Gees' follow-up to Saturday Night Fever was the Spirits Having Flown album. It yielded three more #1 hits: ""Too Much Heaven"", ""Tragedy"", and ""Love You Inside Out."" This gave the act six consecutive #1 singles in America within a year and a half (a record only surpassed by Whitney Houston). ""Too Much Heaven"" ended up as the Bee Gees' musical contribution to the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly in January 1979, a benefit organized by the Bee Gees, Robert Stigwood, and David Frostfor UNICEF that was broadcast worldwide. The brothers donated the royalties from the song to the charity.
The Bee Gees' overwhelming success rose and sank with the disco bubble. By the end of 1979, disco was rapidly declining in popularity, and the backlash against disco put the Bee Gees' American career in a tailspin. Following their remarkable run from 1975-79, the act would only have one more top ten single in the U.S., and not until 1989. The Bee Gees' international popularity sustained somewhat less damage.

1980s and 1990s
In 1981, The Bee Gees released the album Living Eyes, but with the disco backlash still running strong, the album failed to make the US top 40. In 1983, The Bee Gees had greater success with the soundtrack to Staying Alive, the sequel to Saturday Night Fever. The soundtrack was certified platinum in the US, but didn't contain a big hit single from the brothers.
Robin and Barry Gibb released various solo albums in the 1980s, but only with sporadic and moderate chart success. However, the brothers had continuing success behind the scenes, writing and producing for artists such as Barbra Streisand, Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross and Kenny Rogers, including Rogers' multi-million seller and U.S. #1 hit with Dolly Parton, ""Islands in the Stream"".
The Bee Gees released the album E.S.P. in 1987, which sold over 3 million copies. The single ""You Win Again"" went to #1 in numerous countries, including Britain, but only reached #75 in the US.

On March 10, 1988, the fourth brother, Andy, died at age 30 from myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle due to a recent viral infection. His brothers acknowledge that Andy's past drug and alcohol use probably made his heart more susceptible to the ailment. The Bee Gees' following album, One (1989), featured a song dedicated to Andy, ""Wish You Were Here."" The album also contained their first U.S. top ten hit (#7) in a decade, ""One."" After the album's release, they embarked on their first world tour in ten years.
Following their next album, High Civilization, which contained the UK top five hit ""Secret Love,"" The Bee Gees went on a European tour. After the tour, Barry Gibb began to battle a serious back problem, which required surgery. In the early 1990s, Barry Gibb was not the only Bee Gee living in serious pain. Maurice had a serious drinking problem, which he had battled for many years, but finally conquered with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous.
In 1993, they released the album Size Isn't Everything, which contained the UK top five hit ""For Whom the Bell Tolls."" Four years later, they released the album Still Waters, which sold over four million copies, and debuted at #11 in the US. The album's first single, ""Alone,"" gave them another UK Top 5 hit and a top 30 hit in the US.
In late 1997, The Bee Gees performed a live concert in Las Vegas called One Night Only. The CD of the performance sold over 5 million copies. This led to a world tour of ""One Night Only"" concerts. The tour included playing to 56,000 people at London's Wembley Stadium on September 5, 1998, and concluded in the newly-built Olympic Stadium in Sydney, Australia. The Bee Gees closed the decade with what turned out to be their last full-sized concert, known as ""BG2K,"" on December 31, 1999.

Later years
In 2001, they released what turned out to be their final album of new material as a group, This Is Where I Came In. The album gave each member a chance to write in their own way, as well as composing songs together. For example, Maurice's compositions and leads are the ""Man in the Middle"" and ""Walking on Air,"" while Robin contributed ""Déjà Vu,"" ""Promise the Earth,"" and ""Embrace,"" and Barry contributed ""Loose Talk Costs Lives,"" ""Technicolour Dreams"", and ""Voice in the Wilderness"". The other songs are collaborative in writing and vocals. The Bee Gees' last public live show together was Live by Request, a special shown on A&E.
Maurice, who had been the musical director of the Bee Gees during their final years as a group, died suddenly on January 12, 2003 from complications of a twisted intestine. Initially, his surviving brothers announced that they intended to carry on the name ""Bee Gees"" in his memory. But as time passed they decided to retire the group name, leaving it to represent the three brothers together. The same week Maurice died, Robin's solo album Magnet was released.
Although there was talk of a memorial concert featuring both brothers and invited guests, nothing materialized. Since then Barry and Robin have continued to work independently and have both released recordings with other artists. In late 2004, Robin embarked on a solo tour of Germany, Russia and Asia.

Current news
During January 2005, Barry, Robin and several legendary rock artists recorded ""Grief Never Grows Old,"" the official Tsunami relief record for the Disasters Emergency Committee. Later that year, Barry reunited with Barbra Streisand for her top-selling album Guilty Pleasures, released as Guilty Too in the UK as a sequel album to the previous Guilty. Robin continued touring in Europe.
In February 2006 Barry and Robin reunited on stage for a Miami charity concert to benefit the Diabetes Research Institute. It was their first public performance since the death of brother Maurice.

3 Doors Down,"3 Doors Down is a post-Grunge influenced Alternative rock group from Escatawpa, Mississippi, United States that formed in 1996. Consisting of Brad Arnold (vocals), Chet Roberts (guitar, a replacement for Matt Roberts), Todd Harrell (bass), Chris Henderson (guitar), and Greg Upchurch (drums), the band is known for several successful rock singles such as ""Here Without You"" and ""Kryptonite"". The group signed to Universal Records in 2000.

Universal then released their first album, 'The Better Life', and they garnered a big fan response. They received international fame with their first single, ""Kryptonite"", in particular. The album went on to sell over 6 million copies.

In 2002, 'Away From The Sun' was released with the single ""When I'm Gone"". The ballad ""Here Without You"" became another multi-format success, doing especially well in the adult contemporary space, while the singles ""The Road I'm On"" and ""Away From The Sun"" were minor hits. The album went on to sell over 3 million copies.

3 Doors Down released their third studio album, Seventeen Days, in 2005, and it debuted at #1 on the Billboard Music Chart. The album achieved platinum status in less than a month. Its first single, ""Let Me Go"", received much airplay, and was followed by a second song called ""Behind Those Eyes.""

In 2007, they made a music video with the upcoming track ""Citizen Soldiers"" for the National Guard.

In May of 2008 3 Doors Down released their 4th full length studio album the self titled ""3 Doors Down"". The first single is It's Not my Time. They also launched a world tour in March in support. 

Early years (1996-2000)

3 Doors Down was formed by drummer vocalist Brad Arnold, guitarist Matt Roberts and bassist Todd Harrell. The three were friends who had grown up together in Escatawpa, and who all shared a common interest in rock music. The band began playing locally around the city, playing a mix of both cover songs and original songs that would eventually be recorded on their first release. Brad Arnold eventually ended up not only drumming, but also acting as the group's singer, mainly because, as he puts it, ""nobody else would do it, but I did and enjoyed it."" Arnold is also their lyricist, and wrote some of their early hits when he was 15, often working on songs during math class.

The band eventually began to tour outside of their city, and it was during a trip to Foley, Alabama that they came up with their official name. When the three men were walking through the town, they saw a building where some letters had fallen off of its sign, and it read ""Doors Down."" Since at the time they consisted of three people, they added the ""3"" to create ""3 Doors Down.""

A couple years after performing together, Todd Harrell asked guitarist Chris Henderson to join the band in order to make the sound more full. They recorded a demo CD of their original songs at Lincoln Recording Studio in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Radio station 97.9 WCPR started playing the EP version of ""Kryptonite"", and it became the #1 requested song on the station for over 15 weeks and led to Universal Records signing the band.

The Better Life (2000-2001)

3 Doors Down's first album, The Better Life was released on February 2 , 2000, and went on to become the 11th best-selling album of that year, selling over 3 million copies. It has since been certified 6x platinum, thanks in large part to the international hit singles, ""Kryptonite"", ""Loser"", and ""Duck and Run"". A fourth single, ""Be Like That"", also did well and was actually re-recorded for the 2001 film American Pie 2, with alternate lyrics for the first 3 lines. This version is known as ""The American Pie 2 Edit"".

For recording the album, Brad Arnold recorded both the vocal and drum parts. However, when touring to support The Better Life, the band hired a drummer so that Arnold could perform at the front of the stage.

Away from the Sun (2002)

Session drummer Josh Freese was hired to record drums for Away from the Sun. Also, Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson produced and performed on three tracks for the record, ""Dangerous Game"", ""Dead Love"", and ""Wasted Me"", but only ""Dangerous Game"" would appear on the finished product. The band hired Canadian Daniel Adair to play drums for the Away From the Sun tour. He would go on to record the drums for the band's next studio release, and was with the band aboard the U.S.S George Washington (CVN 73) to film the music video ""When I'm Gone"".

Another 700 Miles (2003)

In 2003, 3 Doors Down released a live E.P. entitled Another 700 Miles consisting of recordings from a live performance by the band in Chicago, Illinois. Another 700 Miles has since been certified Gold in the United States. Besides featuring some of 3 Doors Down's hit singles from their previous two albums, the E.P. also contains a version of the popular Lynyrd Skynyrd song ""That Smell"".

In 2003, the band began hosting the annual ""3 Doors Down and Friends"" benefit concert, through the band's own charity The Better Life Foundation. In 2006, this event was held at the Mobile Convention Center, with proceeds benefiting Hurricane Katrina survivors. As residents of Escawtawpa, the members of the band saw the effects of Katrina's devastation.[3]

Seventeen Days (2005-2007)

The band's third studio album, 2005's Seventeen Days, has since been certified platinum. ""Let Me Go"" and ""Behind Those Eyes"" charted with the most success. ""Live for Today"", ""Landing in London"" (on which Bob Seger provided back-up vocals and guitar), and ""Here by Me"" were also released as singles. During the Seventeen Days tour, the band appeared alongside southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, as well as headlined many shows of their own.

Also in 2005, the band released a live DVD entitled Away from the Sun: Live from Houston, Texas. The DVD was produced and directed by Academy Award nominated Alex Gibney and Doug Biro. It features songs from both The Better Life and Away from the Sun, and even some early sketches of ""It's Not Me"" and ""Father's Son"", which were both eventually released on Seventeen Days.

- Greg Upchurch, formerly of Puddle of Mudd, replaced Daniel Adair in 2005, when Adair left to accept the position as drummer and contributing member of Nickelback.[4]

Childish Gambino,"Donald McKinley Glover (/ˈɡlʌvər/; born September 25, 1983) is an American actor, comedian and musician. As a recording artist, he usually performs with the stage name Childish Gambino. While a disk jockey, he performs as mcDJ. He first came to attention for his work with Derrick Comedy and with the help of Tina Fey, was hired at the age of 21 to become a writer for the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. He later played college student Troy Barnes on the NBC sitcom Community. After several self-released albums and mixtapes, Glover signed to Glassnote Records in 2011 as Childish Gambino. He released Camp on Glassnote on November 15, 2011. His second studio album, Because the Internet, was released on December 10, 2013. Glover was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2015, Best Rap Album for Because the Internet and Best Rap Performance for his single ""3005"".

Glover was born at Edwards Air Force Base, California and raised in Stone Mountain, Georgia. His mother, Beverly (Smith, is a retired daycare provider, and his father, Donald, Sr., is a retired postal worker. His parents also served as DeKalb County foster parents for 14 years. He was raised a Jehovah's Witness. He was voted ""Most Likely to Write for The Simpsons"" in his High School yearbook. Glover graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in dramatic writing in 2006.

From 2006 to 2009, Glover was a writer for the NBC series 30 Rock where he also had occasional cameo appearances. He was presented the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Series at the February 2009 ceremony for his work on the third season. Glover's stage name, Childish Gambino, came from the Wu-Tang Clan's name generator. On June 5, 2008, he released an independent album, titled Sick Boi. Glover would then become a member of the sketch comedy group Derrick Comedy, along with Dominic Dierkes, Meggie McFadden, DC Pierson, and Dan Eckman. The group wrote and starred in a feature-length film, Mystery Team, released in theaters in 2009.

On September 17, 2009, Childish Gambino released the independent album Poindexter. A pair of mixtapes, titled I Am Just a Rapper and I Am Just A Rapper 2 were released, in close succession in 2010. Robert Scahill added his producing expertise helping with the majority of the tracks. The track listings for those mixtapes consist of the name of the song ""he"" raps, followed by the song he raps over. His second album, Culdesac, was set to be released on July 2, 2010, but a couple of last minute additions caused the album to be delayed for a day. The album was made available on July 3. Glover has stated in interviews that on Sick Boi and Poindexter he felt he had to hide behind gimmicks, such as pink hoodies, but with his subsequent projects, he has touched on more personal subject matter, including family, schoolyard bullying, troubled romantic relationships, suicidal thoughts and alcoholism. He has disowned his 2005 album, The Younger I Get, as the too-raw ramblings of what he calls a ""decrepit Drake.""

Glover's stand-up special aired on Comedy Central on March 19, 2010. In May 2010, a fan suggested Glover for the role of Peter Parker in the then-upcoming The Amazing Spider-Man film, encouraging his supporters to retweet the hashtag ""#donald4spiderman"". The campaign, originally started to see how far social networking could carry a message, quickly gained a large following. The call for Glover to be allowed to audition for the role was supported by Spider-Man creator Stan Lee. Glover was not awarded an audition and the role instead went to Andrew Garfield. He would later reveal that he was never contacted by anyone from Sony Pictures for the role. Comics writer Brian Michael Bendis, who announced an African-American version of Spider-Man a year later, said he had conceived of the character before Glover's campaign went viral. Bendis gave credit to Glover for influencing the new hero's looks for Spider-man after seeing him dressed as Spider-Man on Community (a nod to the campaign), Bendis said, ""I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.'"" Glover would later voice this incarnation of Spider-Man on the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series.

2Pac,"Tupac Amaru Shakur (June 16, 1971–September 13, 1996), also known by his stage names, Makaveli and 2Pac, was an American hip-hop artist, poet and actor. He is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the best-selling rap/hip-hop artist ever, having sold over 75 million albums worldwide, including 44.5 million sales in the United States alone. He has had 17 top ten singles in the United States.

Born in East Harlem section of Manhattan in New York City, Tupac frequently found his family changing place of residence. In 1988, his family moved and brought Tupac and his half-sister Sekyiwa to live with a family friend in Marin City, California (In the Bay Area). He loved the state of California and decided thats where he would continue to reside for the rest of his life. Shakur soon moved in with a neighbor and started selling drugs and hustling on the street, but he also became interested in rap music. With Ray Luv and DJ Dize, he started a rap group called Strictly Dope. Their recordings were later released in 2001 under the name Tupac Shakur: The Lost Tapes. Their neighborhood performances brought Tupac enough acclaim to land an audition with Shock G of Digital Underground.

In 1990 he was hired as a back-up dancer for the alternative rap group Digital Underground. Tupac’s debut album, 2Pacalypse Now, gained critical recognition and a ranged amount of backlash for its controversial criticism of the police force. Shakur soon began to experience various law suits and legal troubles—most notably, he was convicted of sexually assaulting a woman in 1993. The day before the guilty verdict was issued, Shakur was shot five times in a recording studio lobby in Manhattan. Following the incident, Shakur grew suspicious that other rappers were involved in his shooting; the controversy would help spark the later East Coast-West Coast feud. After serving 8 months of his sentence for the assault, Shakur was bailed from prison by Marion “Suge” Knight, the CEO of Death Row Records. In exchange, Shakur would release three records under the label, with his fifth, being the double disc album All Eyez on Me counting as two albums. On September 7, 1996, Tupac was shot four times in a drive by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. On September 13, 1996, six days after the shooting, Tupac died of respiratory failure and cardiac arrest in a Las Vegas local hospital. Many posthumous albums have been released under Shakur’s name.

Tupac’s music addresses such topics as the hardships of growing up around violence in United States ghettos, poverty, racism, and his feuds with fellow rappers. He is known for the messages of political, economic, and racial equality that pervade his work as well as the “thug life” that he raps about living in. His music has attracted a large amount of controversy and was showcased in the media a number of times. He has gained a large amount of publicity for being one of the main figures in the East Coast vs. West Coast feud between his Death Row Records label and Bad Boy Records. During his lifetime, Tupac released five albums and played roles in several films.

Collaborations

2pac has done songs with many artists, especially L.A. and the Bay Area. Tupac was influenced by many artists in the Bay since he kicked it in Oakland, Ca and used to live in Marin City. The artists he hooked up with include; E-40, Richie Rich, Spice 1, Mac Mall, Ray Luv, Young Lay, Too Short, MC Breed, Assassin, Scarface, Dru Down, Funky Aztecs, B-Legit, Rappin 4-Tay, Method Man, Shock G, Money B, Dramacydal, Ice-T, Ice Cube, Snoop Dog, Dr. Dre, Treach (of Naughty By Nature), Kc & JoJo, C-Bo, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, Daz Dillinger, Bonethugs-N-Harmony, Redman and many more.

Early life

Tupac Amaru Shakur was born in the Harlem section of Manhattan in New York City. He was named after Túpac Amaru II, an Incan revolutionary who led a Peruvian uprising against Spain and was subsequently sentenced to death. His last name Shakur comes from the Arabic word thankful (to God). Fearing someone might hurt her son, Afeni put the name Parish Lesane Crooks on his birth certificate but changed it a year later. Shakur’s mother Afeni was an active member of the Black Panther Party in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s; Shakur was born just one month after his mother’s acquittal on more than 100 charges of “conspiracy against the United States government and New York landmarks” in the “New York Panther 21” court case.

Shakur’s godfather, Elmer “Geronimo” Pratt, was convicted of murdering a schoolteacher during a 1968 robbery. His stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, spent four years at large on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list beginning in 1982, when Tupac was a pre-teen. Mutulu was wanted in part for having aided his sister Assata Shakur, Tupac’s godmother, to escape from prison in New Jersey, where she had been incarcerated for the murder and wounding of two state troopers in 1973. Mutulu was caught in 1986 and imprisoned after being found guilty of the attempted robbery of a Brinks armored car in which two police officers and a guard were killed. Tupac has a half-sister, Sekyiwa, two years his junior, and an older step-brother, Mopreme “Komani” Shakur, who appeared on many of his recordings.

At age 12, Shakur was enrolled in Harlem’s famous “127th Street Ensemble”. His first major role with this acting troupe was as Travis in the play A Raisin in the Sun. In 1984, his family relocated to the Roland Park section of Baltimore. In that neighborhood he was not liked and was a social outcast because of his lack of trendy fashion, his name and looks. However, he had one friend there Dana “Mouse” Smith. In his sophomore year he transferred from Paul Lawrence Dunbar High School to the Baltimore School for the Arts, where he befriended a young Jada Pinkett. The two developed a close friendship. In the documentary Tupac: Resurrection, Shakur says, “Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life.” Also in this documentary, Smith calls Shakur “one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime.” In Tupac’s book, The Rose That Grew From Concrete, there is a poem written by Shakur titled “Jada” including another one titled “The Tears in Cupid’s Eyes” which is dedicated to her. The two remained close friends until Shakur’s death in 1996. At the School for the Arts, he studied ballet, poetry, jazz, and acting, performing in Shakespearean plays and landing the role of the Mouse King in The Nutcracker.

In June 1988, he and his family moved once again, this time to Marin City, California, where Shakur continued to pursue his career in entertainment. At the age of 17, he moved out of his mother’s house to seek his music career. In 1990 he was hired as a back-up dancer and roadie for up-and-coming rap group Digital Underground. His professional entertainment career began in early 1991, when he debuted his rap skills on the single “Same Song” from the group’s album This is an EP Release. Also in 1991, he appeared in the music video for “Same Song” and made a brief appearance as himself in the movie Nothing But Trouble.

In late 1991, after his rap debut, Tupac Shakur performed with Digital Underground again on the album Sons Of The P. Later that year, he released his first solo album, 2Pacalypse Now. Initially he had trouble marketing his solo debut, but Interscope Records executives Ted Field and Tom Whalley eventually agreed to distribute the record.

Shakur claimed his first album was aimed at the problems facing young black males, but it was publicly criticized for its graphic language and images of violence by and against police. In one incident, a young man claimed his killing of a Texas trooper was inspired by the album. Former Vice President Dan Quayle publicly denounced the album as having “no place in our society”. 2Pacalypse Now did not do as well on the charts as future albums, spawning no top ten hits, and only being certified gold nearly 4 years later. His second album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., was released in 1993. Heavily produced by Stretch and the Live Squad, the album generated two hits, Keep Ya Head Up and I Get Around, the latter featuring guest appearances by other members of the Digital Underground crew.

In addition to rapping, Shakur began acting in films. His first starring role was in the 1991 movie Juice, in which he was hailed by Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers as “the film’s most magnetic figure.” He went on to star in Poetic Justice (with Janet Jackson), Above the Rim, Gridlock’d (with Tim Roth), Bullet, and Gang Related. He had also been slated to star in the Hughes brothers’ Menace II Society but was replaced by Larenz Tate after assaulting the directors. Director John Singleton claimed that he wrote the film Baby Boy with Shakur in mind for the leading role. It was eventually filmed with Tyrese Gibson in his place and released in 2001, five years after Shakur’s death. The movie features a mural of Shakur in the protagonist’s bedroom as well as featuring one of his songs.

In late 1993, Shakur formed the group Thug Life with a few of his friends, including Big Syke, Macadoshis, his step-brother Mopreme, and Rated R. The group released their first and only album Thug Life: Thug Life Vol. 1 on Interscope in 1994 which went on to be certified as a gold record.

Legal issues

Even as he garnered fame as a rapper and actor, Shakur gained notoriety for his conflicts with the law. On October of 1991 he filed a $10 million lawsuit against the Oakland Police Department, alleging they brutally beat him over a jaywalking incident. The suit was later settled for $42,000.

In October 1993, in Atlanta, Shakur shot two off-duty police officers (one in the leg, one in the buttocks) that were harassing a black motorist. Charges against Shakur were dismissed when it was discovered that both officers were intoxicated and were in possession of stolen weapons from an evidence locker during the incident.

In December 1993, however, Shakur was charged with sexually abusing a woman in his hotel room. According to the complaint, Shakur sodomized the woman and then encouraged his friends to sexually abuse her. Shakur vehemently denied the charges. Tupac had prior relations days earlier with the woman who was pressing the charges against him. She had performed oral sex on him on a club dance floor and the two had later had sex in his hotel room. The allegations were made after she revisited his hotel room for the second time where she engaged in sexual activity with his friends and claimed Tupac’s entourage had gang-raped her, saying to him while leaving, “How could you do this to me?” Tupac states he had fallen asleep shortly after she arrived and later awoke to her accusations and legal threats. He later said he felt guilty for letting anything occur in the first place, and did not want anyone else to go to jail, but at the same time did not want to go to jail for a crime he didn’t commit. On February 7, 1995, he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for sexual assault; specifically, the conviction offense was for “sexual abuse (forcibly touching the buttocks).”

In 1994, he was convicted of attacking a former employer while on a music video set. He was sentenced to 15 days in jail with additional days on a highway work crew, community service, and a $2000 fine. In 1995, a wrongful death lawsuit was brought against Shakur in the 1992 shooting of 6-year old Qa’id Walker-Teal of Marin City, CA. The child had been the victim of a stray bullet in a shootout between Tupac’s entourage and a rival group, though the bullet was not from Tupac’s gun. Criminal charges were not sought, and Shakur settled with the family for an amount estimated between $300,000 and $500,000. After serving part of his sentence on the sexual abuse conviction, he was released on bail pending his appeal. On April 5, 1996, a judge sentenced him to serve 120 days in jail for violating terms of probation.

The November 30, 1994 Shooting

On the night of November 30, 1994, the day before the verdict in his sexual abuse trial was to be announced, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of the Quad Recording Studios in Manhattan by two black men in an apparent robbery attempt. He would later accuse Puff Daddy (now Diddy) and Notorious B.I.G. whom he saw after the shooting of setting him up. Shakur believed that Biggie and Puffy knew about the plans of the shooting beforehand but had not warned Shakur ahead of time. According to the doctors at Bellevue Hospital, where he was admitted immediately following the incident, Shakur was shot 5 times. He checked out of the hospital, against doctor’s orders, three hours after surgery. The day following the incident, December 1, 1994, Shakur entered the courthouse in a wheelchair and was found guilty of forcibly touching her buttocks.

Prison sentence

Shakur began serving his prison sentence at Clinton Correctional Facility in February 1995. Shortly afterwards, he released his multi-platinum album Me Against the World. Shakur is the only artist ever to have an album at number one on the charts while serving a prison sentence. He married his long-time girlfriend, Keisha Morris, while serving his sentence. This marriage was later annulled. He also spent time reading the works of Niccolò Machiavelli (which inspired his later use of the name “Makaveli”), Sun Tzu’s The Art of War and other works of political philosophy and strategy. He also wrote a screenplay titled Live 2 Tell while incarcerated.

In September 1995, Shakur was released on bail after serving 11 months of his 4 year sentence, due in large part to the help and influence of Marion “Suge” Knight, CEO of Death Row Records. Knight posted $1.4 million bail pending appeal of the conviction, in exchange for which Shakur was obligated to release three albums for the Death Row label.

Post-prison/Death Row Records

After his release from prison, Shakur immediately went back to work recording. He began a new group, Tha Outlawz, and with them released the notorious diss track “Hit ‘Em Up”, a scathing lyrical attack on the Notorious B.I.G (Christopher Wallace) and others associated with him. In the track, Shakur claims to have had sex with Faith Evans, Wallace’s wife at the time, and attacks his street cred. Though there is no hard evidence suggesting that they did, Tupac was convinced that Wallace and Sean “Puffy” Combs had known about the shooting beforehand based on their behavior that night and what his sources told him. He also believed that the lyrics in Biggie’s track “Who Shot Ya” were disrespectful and shouldn’t have been released at such a time.

Shakur aligned himself with Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, who was already bitter toward Combs and his successful Bad Boy label; this added fuel to the building East-West feud. Wallace and Shakur would remain bitter enemies until Shakur’s death.

In February 1996, Shakur released his fourth solo album, All Eyez on Me. This double album was the first and second of his three-album commitment to Death Row Records. It sold over 9 million copies. The album was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of Me Against the World, being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. Dr. Dre left his post as house producer to form his own label, Aftermath. CEO Suge Knight was under investigation for illegal and unethical activities and business practices. Despite these problems, Shakur produced hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on posthumous albums such as Better Dayz and Until the End of Time. He also began the process of recording an album with the Boot Camp Clik and their label Duck Down Records, both New York-based, entitled One Nation. The goal of this project was to bring closure to the East Coast-West Coast feud by bringing together what Shakur thought were the best rappers from both coasts. This project remains unreleased, though some of Tupac’s contributions to the album have been used in various other posthumous releases.

By the end of his life, Tupac was in the middle of starting his film production company Euphanasia, and was going to start writing and directing films. Tupac wanted to host concerts that would be free for students who get a C or above, and wanted to build community centers and start baseball and football leagues for inner-city children. Tupac and Johnny “J” were starting up 24/7 Productions and Tupac was starting up Non-Stop Productions. Thug Passion was a drink that Tupac was planning on bottling and selling; the song “Thug Passion” was made to be a theme song for the drink. Tupac was going to step back from rapping by releasing albums every five years or so on his new record label, Makaveli Records, which would have been distributed by Death Row Records. Tupac and Suge Knight were in the process of expanding Death Row to the East, establishing a Death Row East. Tupac died before this could be fulfilled.

The Fatal September 7, 1996 shooting

On September 7, 1996, Shakur attended the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon boxing match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, NV. After the boxing match, Shakur spotted 21 year-old Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson, a member of the Southside Crips in the MGM Grand lobby. Shakur rushed him and knocked Anderson down, and Shakur’s entourage beat him. The incident was captured on the hotel’s video surveillance. Anderson had allegedly beaten up one of Shakur’s bodyguards in a shopping mall a few weeks earlier, precipitating Shakur’s attack. After the fight with Anderson, Shakur met up with Suge Knight to go to Death Row-owned Club 662 (now known as restaurant/club Seven). Shakur rode with Knight in Knight’s 1996 black BMW 750i sedan, as part of a larger convoy of cars including some of Shakur’s friends, tha Outlawz, and bodyguards.

At 11:14 P.M., while stopped at the intersection of East Flamingo Road and Koval Lane, Shakur was shot in a drive-by shooting. Shakur was hit four times, twice in the chest, and once each in his arm and thigh, while Knight was scratched in the head by a piece of flying glass.

At the time of the shooting, Shakur was riding alongside with Suge Knight, with his bodyguard following behind in a vehicle belonging to Kidada Jones, Shakur’s then-girlfriend. The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that while he was about to ride along with the rapper in Suge Knight’s car, Shakur asked him to drive Kidada Jones’ car in case they were too drunk and needed additional vehicles from Club 662 back to the hotel. Shortly after the shootings, the bodyguard reported in his documentary, Before I Wake, that one of the convoy’s car drove off after the assailant but he never heard back from the occupants.

After arriving on the scene, police and paramedics took Shakur and Knight to the University Medical Center. Shakur was placed on life support until his death six days later, on September 13, 1996, at 4:03 PM. He was 25 years old. The official cause of death was respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. After his death, Shakur’s body was cremated. Family and friends reportedly spread his ashes over the Pacific Ocean near Los Angeles, CA.

Theories of the crime

Although no one has ever been formally charged, nor publicly identified by the police as a suspect, police sources have indicated they believe that Anderson (who has since been murdered himself) and his fellow Southside Crips were behind the shooting. Officers in the Compton, CA Police Department Gang Unit claimed the Crips were bragging about the killing soon after Anderson returned from Las Vegas. Officers further indicated they were disappointed with the lack of initiative shown by the Las Vegas Police Department in pursuing Shakur’s killer(s).

Due largely to the perceived lack of progress on the case by law enforcement, many independent investigations and theories of the crime have emerged. Because of the acrimony between Christopher Wallace (aka The Notorious B.I.G.) and Shakur, there was speculation about the possibility of Wallace’s involvement in the murder from the outset. Wallace vehemently denied involvement. However, in a notable 2002 investigation by the Los Angeles Times, writer Chuck Phillips claimed to have uncovered evidence implicating Wallace in the murder. In the article, Phillips quoted unnamed gang-member sources who claimed Wallace had ties to the Crips, often hiring them for security during West Coast appearances. Phillips’ informants also state that Wallace gave the gang members one of his own guns for use in the attack on Shakur, and that he put out a $1 million contract on Tupac’s life. By the time Phillips’ specific allegations were published, however, Wallace himself had been murdered.

Wallace’s family and associates have vehemently denied Wallace’s involvement in Shakur’s death. In support of their claims, Wallace’s family submitted documentation to MTV indicating that Wallace was working in a New York recording studio the night of Shakur’s murder. Wallace’s manager Wayne Barrow and rapper James “Lil’ Cease” Lloyd made public announcements denying Wallace’s involvement in the murder and claiming further that they were both with Wallace in the recording studio the night of the shooting.

The high profile nature of the killing and ensuing gang violence caught the attention of British filmmaker Nick Broomfield who made the documentary Biggie & Tupac, which examines the lack of progress in the case by speaking to those close to Wallace, Shakur, and the investigation. Shakur’s close childhood friend and member of the Outlawz, Yafeu “Yaki Kadafi” Fula, was in the convoy when the shooting happened and indicated to police that he might be able to identify the assailants. He was killed shortly thereafter in a housing project in Irvington, New Jersey.

It was believed by many listeners that in the first few seconds of the album The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, one could hear a voice saying “Suge shot me,” or “Suge shot ‘em”, closer listening indicates that the words are “Should’a shot me” (You should have shot me), directed towards his enemies at the time. This, along with reports of Knight’s strong-arm tactics with artists and other illegal/unethical business tactics gave rise to a theory that Knight was implicit in Shakur’s murder, as it was reported that Suge Knight owed Tupac up to seventeen million dollars in back royalties, but no evidence has been provided to support this theory.

Other theories have been put forth, including a theory that Shakur is alive and well, but in hiding. Many supporters of these theories point to the symbolism in Shakur’s The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory album and in the video for the single “I Ain’t Mad at Cha”.

Style and influences

Shakur’s first album, 2Pacalypse Now, revealed the socially conscious side of Tupac. On this album Shakur attacked social injustice, poverty and police brutality on songs like “Brenda’s Got a Baby”, “Trapped” and “Part Time Mutha”. His style on this album was heavily influenced by the social consciousness and Afrocentrism pervading hip-hop in the late 1980s and early 1990s. On this initial release, Shakur helped extend the legacy of rap groups like Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, X-Clan, and even Grandmaster Flash, as he became one of the first major socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.

On his second album, Shakur continued to rap about the social ills facing African-Americans, with songs like “The Streetz R Death Row” and “Last Wordz”. He also showed his compassionate side with the inspirational anthem “Keep Ya Head Up”, while simultaneously putting his legendary aggressiveness on display with the title track from the album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. He even added a salute to his former group Digital Underground by including them on the playful track “I Get Around.” Throughout his career, an increasingly aggressive attitude can be seen pervading Shakur’s subsequent albums.

The contradictory themes of social inequality and injustice, unbridled aggression, compassion, playfulness, and hope all continued to shape Shakur’s work, as witnessed with the release of his incendiary 1995 album Me Against the World. Few albums represent the perfect storm of street wisdom, intelligence and the sea of conflicting emotions that is Tupac Shakur better than his 1996 release, the critically acclaimed All Eyez on Me. With several tracks considered classics, including “I Ain’t Mad At Cha”, “California Love (Remix)” and “Picture Me Rollin’”, many critics consider this album to be not only Shakur’s best, but one of the crown jewels of 1990’s rap.

The album The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, released under Tupac’s pseudonym “Makaveli”, presents a stark contrast to previous works. In 7 Day Theory, Tupac continued focusing on the themes of pain and aggression, making this album one of the emotionally darker works of his career. Tupac wrote and recorded all the lyrics in only 3 days and the production took another 4 days a total of 7 days to complete the album. Tupac had complete creative input on the album from the name of the album to the cover which Tupac chose to symbolize how the media has crucified him.

Shakur’s work has influenced many modern rap artists. Artists like Eminem and 50 Cent freely admit his influence on their work. Still others, like DMX, have been compared to Shakur based on their style and public persona.

Legacy

To preserve Shakur’s legacy, his mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation (later re-named the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation or TASF) in 1997. The TASF’s stated mission is to “provide training and support for students who aspire to enhance their creative talents.” The TASF sponsors essay contests, charity events, a performing arts day camp for teenagers and undergraduate scholarships. The Foundation officially opened the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts (TASCA) in Stone Mountain, Georgia on June 11, 2005.

On November 14, 2003, a documentary about Shakur entitled Tupac: Resurrection, was released under the supervision of his mother and narrated entirely in his voice. The movie was nominated for “Best Documentary” in the 2005 Academy Awards. Proceeds will go to a charity set up by Afeni Shakur.

On April 17, 2003, Harvard University co-sponsored an academic symposium entitled “All Eyez on Me: Tupac Shakur and the Search for the Modern Folk Hero.” The speakers discussed a wide range of topics dealing with Shakur’s impact on everything from entertainment to sociology.

Many of the speakers discussed Shakur’s status and public persona, including State University of New York English professor Mark Anthony Neal, who gave the talk “Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian” in which he argued that Shakur was an example of the “organic intellectual” expressing the concerns of a larger group. Professor Neal has also indicated in his writings that the death of Shakur has left a “leadership void amongst hip-hop artists.” Neal further describes Tupac as a “walking contradiction”, a status that allowed him to “make being an intellectual accessible to ordinary people.”

Professor of Communications Murray Forman, of Northeastern University, spoke of the mythical status surrounding Shakur’s life and death. He addressed the symbolism and mythology surrounding Shakur’s death in his talk entitled “Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)”. Among his findings were that Shakur’s fans have “succeeded in resurrecting Tupac as an ethereal life force.”

In “From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero”, Professor of Music at Northeastern University, Emmett Price, compared Shakur’s public image to that of the trickster-figures of African-American folklore which gave rise to the urban “bad-man” persona of the post-slavery period. He ultimately described Shakur as a “prolific artist” who was “driven by a terrible sense of urgency” in a quest to “unify mind, body, and spirit.”

Michael Dyson, University of Pennsylvania Avalon Professor of Humanities and African American Studies and author of the book Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur, indicated that Shakur “spoke with brilliance and insight as someone who bears witness to the pain of those who would never have his platform. He told the truth, even as he struggled with the fragments of his identity.”

Other academics at the Harvard Conference spoke of Shakur’s impact on entertainment, race relations, politics and the “hero/martyr” status to which he was elevated by fans after his death.  The University of California, Berkeley introduced a new course in 1998 called “History ‘98: Poetry and History of Tupac Shakur.”

On April 15, 2012, a ""hologram"" of Shakur performed his songs ""Hail Mary"" and ""2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted"" with Snoop Dogg at the Coachella Music Festival.  The Wall Street Journal reported Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were in talks of a possible tour involving the two rappers and the hologram version of Shakur, which was later turned down by Dr. Dre.

Feist,"Leslie Feist (born February 13, 1976) is a singer/songwriter from Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada. She performs as a solo artist under the name Feist and also as a member of Broken Social Scene. 

Raised in Regina and Calgary, Feist got her start in music as the lead vocalist for a punk band called Placebo (not the more famous British band Placebo), who won a local Battle of the Bands competition and were awarded the opening slot at a Ramones concert. After five years of touring, Feist was forced to take time off from music to recover from voice damage. She moved from Calgary to Toronto in 1998 and took up guitar; by 1999, she was the guitarist for By Divine Right. She also released her debut solo album, Monarch (Lay Your Jewelled Head Down), that year. The album was financed by a grant from the Canadian government.

In 2000, Feist moved in as a roommate with Peaches and Gonzales, and appeared as a guest vocalist on The Teaches of Peaches and Presidential Suite. She then joined the recording sessions for Broken Social Scene's albums Feel Good Lost and You Forgot It in People. 

Feist then moved to Paris, and while in Europe, she collaborated with Norwegian duo Kings of Convenience as a guest vocalist on their album Riot on an Empty Street. Feist recorded her second solo album, Let It Die, in Paris in 2002 and 2003. That album, a combination of jazz and bossa nova was hailed as one of the best Canadian pop albums of 2004 and got her two Juno Awards (The Canadian equivalent of the Grammys). This album also helped her to gain a significant international audience.

She released a remix album entitled Open Season in April 2006.

From different directions, it is said the voice of Feist fits in the range of Ella Fitzgerald or more of an alternative Norah Jones. 

Her third album The Reminder was released on April, 23rd 2007 in Europe, and May, 1st in the rest of the world and is composed of thirteen tracks. Pitchfork rated the album an 8.8.

Her song 1234 from The Reminder was also used in a commercial for the third generation iPod nano. Feist wrote the song with Sally Seltmann, an Australian singer who records as New Buffalo. Speaking with Songfacts, Sellmann said she wrote the song after a good friend told her she was leaving her husband.
Also, her song Mushaboom was used on a Lacoste commercial for their fragrance, A Touch of Pink (as seen in south america), while shortly afterwards, My Moon My Man was used to promote a mobile phone newly released by LG.  She also sang the soundtrack for Paris, je t'aime: La même histoire

Her fourth album Metals was was recorded live over a period of two and a half weeks inside a house on the Northern California coast. It was  released on September 30, 2011 in Ireland, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden and Belgium; October 3, 2011 in the United Kingdom; and October 4, 2011 in the United States and Canada.

Yann Tiersen,"Yann Tiersen (born June 23, 1970 in Brest, Brittany, France) has been honing his musical aesthetic since he could stand on two legs. He started learning piano at the age of four, taking up violin at the age of six and receiving classical training at musical academies in Rennes, Nantes and Boulogne. Then, at the age of 13, he chose to alter his destiny, breaking his violin into pieces, buying a guitar and forming a rock band. 

Yann Tiersen has collaborated with vocal artists like Claire Pichet (""Le phare"" and ""Rue des cascades""), Elizabeth Fraser (""Les retrouvailles"") and Shannon Wright (""Yann Tiersen and Shannon Wright""). Other musicians he has worked with include The Divine Comedy, Noir Désir, Dominique A., Francoiz Breut, Les Têtes Raides, The Married Monk and Sage Francis

Tiersen got a musical education from the city of Rennes' annual Transmusicales festival, seeing acts like Nirvana, Einstürzende Neubaten, Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, The Cramps, Television and Suicide. When his band broke up a few years later, instead of hunting for some new musicians, he bought a cheap mixing desk, an eight-track reel, and started recording music solo with a synth, sampler and drum machine, poring over the grooves of old records on the hunt for loops and orchestral strings to plunder. 

As it turned out, though, the key to his new approach lay in his own past. ""One day I thought, instead of spending days on research and listening to tons of records to find the nearest sound of what I have in mind, why don't I fix this fucking violin and use it?"" Through the summer of 1993, Tiersen stayed in his apartment, recording music alone with guitar, violin and accordion, guided not by the classical canon, but by intuition and his vision of ""a musical anarchy"".  

By the end of the summer of 1993, Tiersen had recorded over 40 tracks, which would form the bulk of his first two albums. 1995's La Valse Des Monstres, inspired by Tod Browning's Freaks and Yukio Mishima's The Damask Drum was the second album to be released on Nancy-based label Ici, d'ailleurs. It would be followed six months later by Rue Des Cascades, a collection of short pieces recorded with toy piano, harpsichord, violin, accordion and mandolin. Six years later, the record would find a much larger audience when several tracks, along with a couple of Tiersen originals, would be used on the soundtrack to Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film Amelie (2001). 

Tiersen's commercial breakthrough would come earlier, though, and off his own back. 1998's Le Phare (The Light House) was recorded in self-imposed seclusion on the isle of Ouessant, where Tiersen spent two months living in a rented house. At night, he watched the Creach'h, the most powerful lighthouse in Europe, as it illuminated the surrounding scenery. ""I was amazed how the rays of lights from the lighthouse revealed some hidden details of the land, how we can rediscover something we have everyday, just in front of us, by a light pointing on it,"" says Tiersen. 

Le Phare went on to sell over 160,000 copies, confirming Tiersen's status as one of the most pioneering and original artists of his generation and commencing a run of successful albums like 2001's L'Absente (featuring orchestral group Synaxis, Lisa Germano and the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon) and 2005's Les Retrouvailles (with guests Stuart Staples of Tindersticks, Jane Birkin and Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins). In this period, Tiersen also took his music out around the world, playing shows with a full orchestra and an amplified string quartet – a set-up captured on 2002's electrifying live album C'etait ici. And following the box-office success of Amelie, Tiersen's skills as a soundtracker were much in demand, leading to scores for the likes of Wolfgang Becker's tragicomedy Good Bye Lenin! (2003) and Tabarly (2008), a documentary about the French sailor Éric Tabarly, who ate his final meal on Ouessant Island before he meeting a watery end in the Irish sea.

Cat Power,"Charlyn Marie Marshall, also known as Chan (pronounced ""Shawn"") Marshall, was born in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. on 21 January 1972. After dropping out of high school, she started performing under the name Cat Power, while in Atlanta, backed by musicians Glen Thrasher, Mark Moore, and others. She soon moved to New York City, New York, United States in 1992, then later opening for Liz Phair in 1994, she met Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth and Tim Foljahn of Two Dollar Guitar, who encouraged her to record, and played on her first two albums, 1995's Dear Sir and 1996's Myra Lee. In 1996 she was signed to Matador Records, and released her third album, What Would the Community Think, which spawned a single and music video, ""Nude as the News"".

Shortly following the release of What Would the Community Think Marshall disappeared from the musical scene, initially working as a baby sitter in Portland, Oregon and then moving to a farmhouse in Prosperity, South Carolina with boyfriend Bill Callahan (who performs under the name Smog). The plan was to permanently retire from music but during a sleepless night resulting from a nightmare, Marshall wrote several new songs. These songs would make up the bulk of Moon Pix. The album was recorded at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne in eleven days with backing musicians Mick Turner and Jim White of the Dirty Three. The album was well-received by critics, and gained her recognition in the indie rock scene. However, during the subsequent tours she grew tired of her own material. This resulted in a series of shows during 1999 involving Marshall providing musical accompaniment to a series of screenings of the silent movie The Passion of Joan of Arc. The shows combined original material and many covers, many of which would later see release on The Covers Record, a collection of cover songs recorded at various sessions in 1998 and 1999. A selection of covers that didn't make it on to the album were recorded at Peel Acres, home of the highly influential and legendary British DJ John Peel. The session was broadcast on his BBC Radio 1 show and featured Marshall's own interpretations of Bob Dylan's ""Hard Times in New York Town"" amongst others.

In 2003 she resumed releasing original material with You Are Free, a diverse and critically acclaimed album that featured guest musicians such as Eddie Vedder, Dave Grohl, and the Dirty Three's Warren Ellis.

2004 saw the release of Speaking for Trees, a critically polarizing DVD which featured a single two-hour static shot of Marshall performing in a woodland. It was accompanied by an audio CD containing the 18-minute song ""Willie Deadwilder"", which featured M. Ward on guitar. 2005 found Cat Power out on the road again, touring the world and playing sold-out solo shows, including an Australian tour supporting Nick Cave. The shows largely consisted of material for her next album.

Cat Power's seventh record, The Greatest, was released in January, 2006. This was not a ""Greatest Hits"" record but rather a collaboration with Al Green's guitarist Teenie Hodges and many other well-known R&B musicians. A tour followed in the fall of 2006.

Early in 2006, Marshall announced the cancellation of her upcoming United States tour, citing ""health-related issues"". A few days later, Matador announced the cancellation of her two shows in London and Paris. She resumed touring in April 2006, playing some of the most well received shows of her career both with the Memphis Rhythm Band and as a solo performer. 

In 2007, she played live music for the spring/ summer Chanel Haute Couture collection in Paris and appeared in Wong Kar Wai's film My Blueberry Nights as Katya. Also in 2007, she became the first female ever to win the Shortlist Music Prize when The Greatest was voted album of the year in June. Earlier in the year she was nominated in the Best International Female category at the annual Brit Awards, alongside more mainstream artists like Christina Aguilera and Nelly Furtado. 

On January 22, 2008, Cat Power released a second collection of covers called Jukebox--her eighth LP overall. It included versions of songs by artists such as Hank Williams, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Patsy Cline and Janis Joplin.

Since then, she has released an EP called ""The Dark End of the Street"" on vinyl, only.

Cat Power released her first original song since 2008 just before Christmas 2011 when an MP3 of ""King Rides By"" was made available on her official site, in exchange for a donation of at least $0.99 to the Festival of Children Foundation and the Ali Forney Center charities. (King Rides By Songfacts). 

In 2012, Cat Power released her 9th studio album,  Sun  which received generally positive reviews from critics. The album was included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications. Rolling Stone magazine, in their list of the ""50 Best Albums of 2012"", ranked it at sixteenth place, writing ""the idea of the brilliantly morose Chan Marshall making a dance-rock record is almost absurd. Yet the groove-powered Sun is a perfect fit."" The A.V. Club placed the album at number twenty-two on their list of the ""Best Albums of 2012."" Billboard also placed the album at number nine in their list of the ""10 Best Albums of 2012.""The L.A. Times and Filter magazine both placed the album at number six in their lists of the best albums of 2012. Sun was also included on two separate ""Best Music of 2012"" lists compiled by NPR, appearing at number five on the list compiled by Bob Boilen,while topping the list compiled by Robin Hilton. The album was also listed twenty-eighth on Stereogum's list of top 50 albums of 2012. Thus, becoming Cat Power's most successful original album. 

In April 2015, Marshall announced that she recently had a baby.

In February 2016, Marshall had to cancel her New Zealand shows due to health reasons. According to an official press release, this is the first time in Marshall's 18-year touring history she has been forced to postpone, but is ""determined to make it back ASAP, and in good health"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cat+Power"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Sting,"Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner CBE (born 2 October 1951 in Wallsend, Newcastle upon Tyne, England), known by his stage name Sting, is an English musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, activist, actor and philanthropist. Prior to starting his solo career, he was the principal songwriter, lead singer and bassist for the rock band The Police. Throughout his career, Sting has incorporated distinct elements of jazz, reggae, classical, New Age, and worldbeat into his music. As a solo musician and member of The Police, Sting has received sixteen Grammy Awards; receiving his first Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1981, three Brit Awards (including Best British Male in 1994), a Golden Globe, an Emmy Award, and several Oscar nominations for Best Original Song. He is a member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Born Gordon Matthew Sumner, he is the eldest of four children. Sumner was raised in the Roman Catholic tradition, due to the influence of his paternal grandmother, who was from an Irish family.  He attended St Cuthbert's Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne, and then the University of Warwick, but did not graduate. During this time, he often sneaked into nightclubs like the Club-a-Go-Go. Here he saw acts like Jack Bruce and Jimi Hendrix, who would later influence his music. After jobs as a bus conductor, a construction labourer, and a tax officer, he attended Northern Counties Teachers' Training College, which later became part of Northumbria University, from 1971 to 1974. He then worked as a teacher at St Paul's First School in Cramlington for two years.

From an early age, Sumner knew that he wanted to be a musician. His first music gigs were wherever he could get a job, performing evenings, weekends, and during vacations from college and teaching. He played with local jazz bands such as the Phoenix Jazzmen, the Newcastle Big Band, and Last Exit.

He gained his nickname while with the Phoenix Jazzmen. He once performed wearing a black and yellow jersey with hooped stripes that bandleader Gordon Solomon had noted made him look like a bumblebee; thus Sumner became ""Sting"".  

In January 1977, Sting moved from Newcastle to London, and soon thereafter he joined Stewart Copeland and Henry Padovani (who was very soon replaced by Andy Summers) to form the new wave band The Police. The group had several chart-topping albums and won six Grammy Awards in the early 1980s.

Although they jumped on the punk bandwagon early in their career, The Police soon abandoned that sound in favor of reggae-tinged rock and minimalist pop. Their last album, Synchronicity, which included their most successful song, "" Every Breath You Take"", was released in 1983.

In September 1981 Sting made his first live solo appearance, performing on all four nights of the fourth Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policeman's Other Ball at the invitation of producer Martin Lewis. He also led an all-star band (dubbed The Secret Police) on his own arrangement of Bob Dylan's, ""I Shall Be Released"". The band and chorus included Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck,  Phil Collins, Bob Geldof, and Midge Ure, all of whom (except Beck) later worked together on Live Aid.

His performances were featured prominently in the album and film of the show and drew Sting major critical attention. Sting's participation in The Secret Policeman's Other Ball was the beginning of his growing involvement in raising money and consciousness for political and social causes.

In 1982 he released a solo single, ""Spread a Little Happiness"" from the Dennis Potter television play Brimstone and Treacle. The song was a re-interpretation of a song from the 1920s musical Mr Cinders by Vivian Ellis, and was a surprise top-twenty hit in the U.K.

Sting's first solo album, 1985's The Dream of the Blue Turtles, featured a cast of accomplished jazz musicians, including Kenny Kirkland, Darryl Jones, Omar Hakim, and Branford Marsalis. It included the hit single ""If You Love Somebody Set Them Free"". The album also contained the hits ""Fortress around Your Heart"", ""Russians"", and ""Love Is the Seventh Wave"". Within a year, it reached triple platinum. This album gained Sting a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. The film and video Bring On the Night documented the formation of the band and its first concert in France.

Also in 1985, he sang the introduction and chorus to ""Money for Nothing"", a song by Dire Straits. He later performed this song with Dire Straits at the Live Aid Concert at Wembley Stadium. Sting also provided a short guest vocal performance on the Miles Davis album You're Under Arrest. He also sang backing vocals on Arcadia's single ""The Promise"", and contributed a version of ""Mack the Knife"" to the Hal Willner-produced tribute album Lost in the Stars: the Music of Kurt Weill.

Sting released ...Nothing Like the Sun in 1987, including the hit songs ""We'll Be Together"", ""Fragile"", ""Englishman in New York"", and ""Be Still My Beating Heart"", dedicated to his recently-deceased mother. It eventually went double platinum. The song ""The Secret Marriage"" from this album was adapted from a melody by German composer Hans Eisler, and ""Englishman in New York"" was about the eccentric writer Quentin Crisp. The album's title is taken from William Shakespeare's Sonnet number 130.

In February 1988 he released ...Nada como el sol, a selection of five songs from Nothing Like the Sun which he sang in Spanish and Portuguese. Sting was also involved in two other recordings in the late 1980s, the first in 1987 with noted jazz arranger Gil Evans who placed Sting in a big band setting for a live album of Sting's songs (the CD was not released in the U.S.), and the second on Frank Zappa's 1988 Broadway the Hard Way, on which Sting performs an unusual arrangement of ""Murder by Numbers"", set to the tune ""Stolen Moments"" by jazz composer Oliver Nelson, and ""dedicated"" to fundamentalist evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.

Sting's 1991 album The Soul Cages was dedicated to his recently-deceased father and included the top-ten song ""All This Time"" and the Grammy-winning ""Soul Cages"". The album eventually went platinum. The following year he married Trudie Styler and was awarded an honorary doctorate in music by Northumbria University. In 1993, he released the album Ten Summoner's Tales, which went triple platinum in just over a year. The title is wordplay on his surname, Sumner, and Geoffrey Chaucer's classic The Canterbury Tales. Concurrent video albums were released to support Soul Cages (a live concert) and Ten Summoner's Tales (recorded during the recording sessions for the album).

In May 1993, Sting released a cover of his song from The Police's album Ghost in the Machine, ""Demolition Man"" for the film Demolition Man.

In 1994, Sting, Bryan Adams and Rod Stewart performed the chart-topping song ""All for Love"" from the film The Three Musketeers. The song stayed at the top of the U.S. charts for five weeks and went platinum; it is to date Sting's only song from his post-Police career to top the U.S. charts. In February, he won two more Grammy Awards and was nominated for three more. The Berklee College of Music gave him his second honorary doctorate of music degree in May. In November, he released a greatest hits compilation called Fields of Gold: the Best of Sting 1984-1994, which was eventually certified double platinum.

In 1996 he released Mercury Falling. He reached the top forty with two singles in the same year: ""You Still Touch Me"" and ""I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying"". During this period, Sting was also recording music for the Disney film Kingdom of the Sun, which went on to be reworked into The Emperor's New Groove. The film went through drastic overhauls and plot changes, and Sting's songs were not used in the final film. The story was put into a final product: The Sweatbox, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. Disney currently holds the rights to the film and will not grant its release. That same year Sting also released a little-known CD-ROM called All This Time, which included music, commentary, and custom computer features describing Sting and his music from his perspective.

The Emperor's New Groove soundtrack was released, however, with complete songs from the previous version of the film. The final single used to promote the film was ""My Funny Friend and Me"".

Sting's1999 album Brand New Day included the top-forty hit ""Brand New Day"" and the top-ten hit ""Desert Rose"". The album went triple platinum by January 2001. In 2000, he won Grammy Awards for the album and for the song of the same name. At the awards ceremony, he performed ""Desert Rose"" with Cheb Mami. For his performance, the Arab-American Institute Foundation gave him the Kahlil Gibran Spirit of Humanity Award. However, Sting was criticised for appearing in a Jaguar advertisement using ""Desert Rose"" as its backing track, particularly as he was a notable environmentalist.

In February 2001, he won another Grammy. His song ""After the Rain Has Fallen"" made it into the top forty. His next project was to record a live album at his Tuscan villa, which was released as a CD and DVD, as well as being simulcast in its entirety on the internet. The resultant album and DVD ...All This Time was released in November and featured re-workings of Sting favourites such as ""Roxanne"" and ""If You Love Somebody Set Them Free"". It was recorded on 11th September 2001 and is dedicated ""to all those who lost their lives on that day"".

In 2002 Sting won a Golden Globe Award and in June, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the summer, Sting was awarded the honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 2003  he released Sacred Love, a studio album collaboration with hip-hop artist Mary J. Blige and sitar player Anoushka Shankar. He and Blige won a Grammy for their duet ""Whenever I Say Your Name"".

His autobiography Broken Music was published in October. Sting embarked on a Sacred Love tour in 2004 with performances by Annie Lennox. Sting went on the Broken Music tour, touring smaller venues, with a four piece band kicking off in Los Angeles on 28 March 2005 and ending this ""College Tour"" on 14 May 2005. Continuing with his involvement in Live Aid, he appeared at Live 8 in July 2005.

In October 2006, Sting released Songs from the Labyrinth featuring the music of John Dowland (an Elizabethan-era composer) and accompaniment from Bosnian lute player Edin Karamazov. As a part of the promotion of this album, he appeared on the fifth episode of Studio 60, during which he performed a segment of Dowland's ""Come Again"" as well as his own ""Fields of Gold"" in an arrangement for voice and two archlutes.

In October 2009 Sting released If On a Winter's Night, a celebration of winter and rebirth.  The album begins with traditional music of the British Isles, going on to carols, lullabies spanning centuries such as ""The Snow It Melts the Soonest"" (traditional Newcastle ballad), ""Soul Cake"" (traditional English ""begging"" song), ""Gabriel's Message"" (fourteenth-century carol), as well as two of Sting's own compositions: ""Lullaby for an Anxious Child"" and ""The Hounds of Winter"". Also featured on the album is ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"", a musical reworking and English translation (by Sting) of ""Der Leiermann"" from Franz Schubert's Winterreise.  Guitarist Dominic Miller joins him as well as an ensemble of harpists, pipers, and fiddlers creating an acoustic meditation on winter.

BMI Award - 2016 On October 10, 2016, Sting was awarded the Icon Award at the BMI Awards in London, UK. In announcing the award, BMI CEO Mike O’Neill hailed Sting as “truly a creative force, a brilliant songwriter, an artist”. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sting"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ryan Adams,"Ryan Adams (born David Ryan Adams on November 5, 1974) is an alt-country and rock and roll singer-songwriter from Jacksonville, North Carolina.  Initially part of the group Whiskeytown, which was at the time considered one of the leaders of the alt-country genre, Adams left the band and released his first solo album, Heartbreaker, in 2000 (which was subsequently nominated for the Shortlist Music Prize). As well as his solo albums, Adams has released  five albums as Ryan Adams & the Cardinals.

Adams dropped out of high school at age 16 to work in a shoe shop and make music. He formed a band named Whiskeytown in 1994; they disbanded in 1999 having released two full albums, Faithless Street and Strangers Almanac. Adams went on to put out his first solo record, Heartbreaker, in 2000. After a long delay, in 2001 Whiskeytown's third album Pneumonia was finally issued. 

In 2002, Ryan contributed backing vocals on Butterfly in Reverse, from the Counting Crows album, Hard Candy; after Adam Duritz (Counting Crows lead singer) appeared on the album Gold.

Ryan is highly prolific, and in 2005 released one double album and two regular albums: Cold Roses, Jacksonville City Nights and 29, respectively. His album, 29, was produced by friend Ethan Johns (who also produced his first two albums, Heartbreaker and Gold). In between those two releases and his 2005 triple-header, Ryan released Demolition (a collection of out-takes), Love Is Hell and Rock N Roll. Unreleased studio albums include 48 Hours, Exile On Franklin Street and Suicide Handbook.

In addition, Adams worked with Jesse Malin to form the punk-rock group The Finger (under the pseudonyms, ""Warren Peace"" and ""Irving Plaza"" respectively), who released two E.P.s which were collected together to form We Are Fuck You, released on One Little Indian Records in 2003.

In 2006 Ryan went on a minor UK-tour and a minor US-tour along the west-coast and has streamed 11+ mini albums on his website, under numerous jokey pseudonyms (DJ Reggie, Werewolph, The Shit, Rhoda Ro, Ghetto Birds). 

The following solo record, entitled Easy Tiger, was released on June 26, 2007. The newest and last record with his backing band The Cardinals, Cardinology, was released in October 2008 and followed by extensive touring through the UK, US and Australia.

In January 2009 he announced that he would be going on an indefinite hiatus from music. The Kindness Songfacts reports that the major reason for Adams’ temporary retirement was his struggles with Ménière’s disease, a disorder of the inner ear that wrecks havoc on hearing and balance. Adams resumed performing in October 2010, and released his thirteenth studio album, Ashes & Fire, on October 11, 2011. His wife, pop singer and actress Mandy Moore, contributed some backing vocals. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Adams"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Electric Light Orchestra,"Electric Light Orchestra were a symphonic rock band which formed in Birmingham, England in 1970. The band was formed by Jeff Lynne (vocals, guitar, multiple instruments), Roy Wood (multiple instruments, vocals), Richard Tandy (keyboards, vocals) and Bev Bevan (drums). Lynne, Wood and Bevan were former members of the psychedelic rock band The Move. The band's lineup would fluctuate throughout its original incarnation, although Lynne, Tandy and Bevan would remain constant members.

They incorporated the sounds of string ensembles, vocoders and dub echos into rock songs, thereby creating a very sophisticated studio version of rock. The musical content of ELO songs often went far beyond usual chord structures, mixing pop songwriting with classical romanticism and synthesized sounds. The band claim that their music ""picks up where The Beatles' 1967 song I Am the Walrus left off.""

Formed in 1970 by Roy Wood, Jeff Lynne and Bev Bevan (the remaining members of the 1960s rock group The Move). The band used cellos, violin, horns and woodwinds to give their music a classical sound. This was an idea Roy Wood initially had while with The Move, to take rock music in a new direction. In 1970 when Carl Wayne left the The Move, Jeff Lynne, front man with fellow Brum band Idle Race, responded to Wood's second invitation to join the line-up, with the lure of starting the new band. To help finance the fledgling project, two more Move albums were released during the recording of their eponymous first album in 1971 which produced the UK hit 10538 Overture. In the US this album was released with the mistaken title of No Answer, due to a mix-up with an uncompleted telephone call to the American label and subsequent secretarial message.

However, tensions soon surfaced between Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne. With most of the media attention focused on Roy Wood, differences in musical direction, and a disastrous first live outing, it was no surprise when the band went through the first of its many line-up changes as Wood took Hugh McDowell and Bill Hunt with him to form Wizzard. Despite the music press's predictions that the band would fold without Wood, Jeff Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan remaining on drums, bassist Richard Tandy switching to moog synthesizer, Michael d'Albuquerque on bass, Mike Edwards, Colin Walker (cello) and Wilfred Gibson replacing Steve Woolam on violin. They released ELO 2 in 1973, from which came their first U.S. chart hit, a hugely elaborate version of the Chuck Berry classic Roll Over Beethoven. After their second album, violinist Gibson was dismissed and replaced by Mik Kaminski. They also released On The Third Day in 1973, with Mike Edwards playing all the cello parts due to Colin Walker leaving the band. Later that same year saw the return of Hugh McDowell, who had jumped ship the year previous, to replace cellist Colin Walker.

In 1974 Lynne hired a thirty-piece orchestra, choir and Louis Clark, then began work on the next LP Eldorado, A Symphony, a concept album about dreams, scoring their first U.S. Top Ten hit with Can't Get It Out Of My Head in 1975. Eldorado would become ELO's first gold album.
 
After the release of Eldorado, bassist and vocalist Kelly Groucutt and cellist Melvyn Gale joined, replacing de Albuquerque and Edwards respectively.

The band split in 1983. In 1985, Lynne, Tandy and Bevan reunited and recorded the album ""Balance of Power"". This reunion was short lived and the band split once more in 1986. Bev Bevan and Louis Clark, with the consent of Lynne, toured and recorded as ELO Part II from 1988 until Bevan's retirement in 1999. In 2000, Lynne and Tandy reformed Electric Light Orchestra and released a new record, ""Zoom"". ""Zoom"" proved to be a commercial failure, and the duo split once more in 2001. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Electric+Light+Orchestra"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

ZHU,"A few weeks back, we shared “Superfriends,” a release from a then mysterious artist either named “Z” or “user601586061.” Less than 24 hours after the song hit the Internet, a Do Androids Dance? reader did some NSA-caliber snooping to discover that the man behind “Superfriends” and the infectious “Moves Like Ms. Jackson” was actually Steven Zhu, a producer who had previously released music under the name ZHU.

""Many are wondering why I chose to release my music anonymously. I am my own ghostwriter. As a society, we become more attached to the creator than to the creation. Music is faceless. My music is for a new generation—one in which people appreciate art for its intrinsic value—Generation WHY.""

–ZHU, on his decision to maintain anonymity

Now fully in the sun, ZHU returns with new single “Faded.” Though the weekend is almost behind us, “Faded” is yet another perfect soundtrack for late night mischief in the re-emergent producer’s catalog. It features the same infectious synth work and affected falsetto vocals that made both “Moves Like Ms. Jackson” and “Superfriends” such pleasant surprises. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/ZHU"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Passion Pit,"Passion Pit is an American indietronica band from Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, formed in 2007. The band consists solely of Michael Angelakos (lead vocals, keyboards), joined live by joined live by Chris Hartz (drums), Aaron Harrison Folb (bass/synthesizers), Giuliano Pizzulo (guitar/synthesizers), and Ray Suen (guitar/synthesizers).

""Passion Pit"" was a vocabulary word used in a class Michael took in school. The band called their name from the Variety Slanguage Dictionary, a glossary of Variety's frequently-used slang, which was provided by the Hollywood Insider publication to help not-so-savvy readers decipher its content. The magazine used the term to refer to drive-in theatres, because of their privacy and romantic allure for teenagers.

The first Passion Pit songs, which would later become the Chunk of Change EP, were written by Angelakos at Emerson College as a belated Valentine's Day gift to his then-girlfriend. At first, he wrote and performed all his material alone using a laptop. These sets of songs were passed around Emerson and caught the attention of many blogs.

Michael played his first shows alone sitting with his laptop and a microphone. After one of these solo shows in the Boston area, Ian Hultquist, who was attending Berklee at the time, approached Angelakos and expressed interest in creating and playing music collaboratively. After a few line-up changes, Passion Pit was born. They formed a group that consisted of Angelakos, Hultquist, Ayad Al Adhamy, Thom Plasse (bass), and Adam Lavinsky (drums). The band spent a considerable amount of time trying to flesh out a collaborative format and structure that would work best for them. Jeff Apruzzese and Nate Donmoyer joined the band shortly after they signed to Frenchkiss in 2008, replacing Plasse and Lavinsky, respectively. In 2012, Adhamy was replaced by Xander Singh.

The band's debut EP, ""Chunk of Change"", was released on September 16, 2008. The first four tracks were those that Angelakos had written as a gift for his girlfriend, which had already become popular throughout Emerson where he had been passing out his own, self-produced copies. Two tracks, ""Better Things"" and ""Sleepyhead"", were added for the commercial release of the EP. The same year of their debut EP's release, the band was chosen as ""Best New Local Act in 2008"" in the WFNX/Boston Phoenix best music poll.

The first and only single to be released from the EP, ""Sleepyhead"", received a good deal of exposure through its use in numerous media campaigns and advertisements, while the video for the song, directed by The Wilderness, was included on Pitchfork's Top 40 Music Videos of 2008 list. The song contains samples of ""Óró Mo Bháidín"" by Irish singer and harpist Mary O'Hara.

Other songs from the EP received some exposure as well. ""Cuddle Fuddle"" was featured in E4's second series of The Inbetweeners and ""I've Got Your Number"" was used in an advertisement for the cash card from O2, Money in the UK.





The band's first full-length studio album, Manners, was released on May 18, 2009 in the UK and May 19, 2009 in the United States and Canada. In celebration, the band played their record release party on the 18th in New York City on a Rocks Off boat cruise. In a preview article, ClashMusic.com commented that the album ""has every chance to rank as one of the year's best"" and that ""it reveals additional nuances with each visit: a sure-fire sign of an album with true longevity"".

In order to obtain a specific background vocal accompaniment the band was looking for on Manners, Passion Pit enlisted the help of the PS22 chorus, who recorded vocals in-studio for three of the album's songs: ""The Reeling"", ""Little Secrets"", and ""Let Your Love Grow Tall"".

Passion Pit made their television debut on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday, July 29th, 2009 performing their song ""The Reeling"" from the album.

""The Reeling"" was the first single to be released from the album and found success on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the fall of 2009, where it peaked at number 34 in October. ""Little Secrets"" was the third single to be released and had success on the chart as well, topping out at number 39. ""Let Your Love Grow Tall"" was never released as a single but had some exposure being used in the sixteenth episode of the fourth season of the TV series Ugly Betty.

The album's second single, ""To Kingdom Come"", was used in the Rhapsody commercial for its iPhone application.

""Sleepyhead"" was the only track from Chunk of Change to be included on the album and was made available from iTunes for free as a discovery download in 2009. The song continued to receive additional exposure through its appearances in advertisements. It was used in a season 3 episode of the teen-drama, Skins, and most recently in the debut trailer for LittleBigPlanet 2, which led to the band's increased popularity amongst fans and players of the game, who eventually created an in-game instrumental version of the song to listen to in the first game. When the sequel was released, it came with the song's actual instrumental version used in the trailer. This song has also been used in an advertisement for the Palm Pixi and the Canadian PSP.

The song ""Moth's Wings"" was used in the fourth episode of the third season of the CW teen drama Gossip Girl and in the closing credits of episode 36 of HBO's Big Love. It appeared in the FIFA 10 video game and was featured in the film Life As We Know It, starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel. Additionally, the track has been used as a background theme for Sky Sports' coverage of the UEFA Champions League and as the music for a dance routine in Episode 5, Season 8, of the US television show So You Think You Can Dance (United States), which received a standing ovation from the show's judges. It was also featured in MTV's show Awkward.

On April 13, 2010, the band reissued Manners in a deluxe edition format which contained new artwork and three additional tracks: stripped-down versions of ""Sleepyhead"" and ""Moth's Wings"" and a cover of The Cranberries' song ""Dreams"". The deluxe release coincided with the extension of their North American headlining tour.

The band released another cover in June 2010, this time offering up their take on The Smashing Pumpkins hit song ""Tonight, Tonight"" as part of a promotion with Levi's called ""Pioneer Sessions"".
In September 2010, Passion Pit toured with the English band Muse as their opening act for eight shows during their fall tour through parts of the U.S.





In an August 2010 interview with NME, Angelakos stated that work had already begun on the follow-up to Manners and that the band intended to release the album in the spring of 2011. He then said that it will be released early in 2012.

On April 24, 2012, Angelakos announced the title of the album, Gossamer, and that it would be released on July 24, 2012.

On May 7, the first track from Gossamer was released, called ""Take a Walk"".

On June 12, the second track from Gossamer was released, called ""I'll Be Alright"". The track leaked early on June 11th and was released as an NME premiere on June 8.

On July 9, a third track from Gossamer, called ""Constant Conversations"", was reviewed and featured as ""best new track"" by Pitchfork. It was released with the review as streamed content.

Passion Pit officially released their second album, Gossamer, on July 20, 2012 to critical acclaim.

On July 16th, Angelakos posted on the Passion Pit website that the band has cancelled the remaining July tour dates and suspended the tour in order for Angelakos to seek ongoing treatment for bipolar disorder. A Rolling Stones interview stated that Angelakos was diagnosed at 17, undergoing therapy, hospital care, and medication ever since.

On October 13, they performed on Saturday Night Live. They played ""Take a Walk"" and ""Carried Away"".

On September 24, Passion Pit released the Constant Conversations EP, exclusively available on Spotify. The EP featured an alternative version of Constant Conversations from their 2012 album Gossamer, in addition to a formerly unreleased b-side called Ruin Your Day. The final track on the EP was a remix of Carried Away by Dillon Francis. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Passion+Pit"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Enrique Iglesias,"Enrique Iglesias (born Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler on May 8, 1975, in Madrid, Spain) is a Miami-based singing sensation and multi-million-album seller. He is the son of famous Spanish singer Julio Iglesias and Spanish-mestiza Filipina socialite and Hola! magazine journalist Isabel Preysler. He also is the brother of Chabeli Iglesias and Julio José Iglesias, and half-brother of Tamara Falcó and Ana Boyer (from his mother's side) and Miguel Alejandro, Rodrigo, Cristina, Victoria and Guillermo Iglesias (from his father's side).

After the widely publicized kidnapping of his grandfather in Spain, Iglesias moved to Miami, Florida in 1983, at age 8. While in Miami, Iglesias enjoyed the luxury of being the son of a billionaire, but he developed a taste for simpler things, a fact that would later surface in his concerts, where he appeared in plain clothes, including white cotton shirts.

Iglesias first performed while in high school, in the musical Hello Dolly. While attending the University of Miami, he was auditioned by his future manager, who was impressed. Using the pseudonym Enrique Martínez, the two promoted his demos across various record labels. Months later, Iglesias was signed by Fonovisa and went to Toronto to record his first album in total anonymity.

Iglesias has been linked to rumors of romantic relationships with a number of women: former Miss Universe Alicia Machado; the model/actor and Miami resident Sofia Vergara; the pop singer Christina Aguilera; and the actress Jennifer Love Hewitt. More recently, he has reputedly been dating the Russian tennis player, Anna Kournikova for a number of years.

On July 12, 1995, Iglesias released his first album titled Enrique Iglesias, a collection of light rock ballads, including such mega-hits as ""Si Tú Te Vas"", ""Experiencia Religiosa"", and others. The record sold half a million copies in its first week, a rare accomplishment then for an album recorded in a language other than English. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Enrique+Iglesias"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Megadeth,"Megadeth is an American thrash metal band led by founder, frontman, guitarist, and songwriter Dave Mustaine. Formed in 1983 Los Angeles, California with bass player Dave Ellefson following Mustaine's departure from Metallica, the band has since released fourteen studio albums, three live albums, five compilation albums, two extended plays, thirty-four singles, eight video albums, and thirty-two music videos.

As a pioneer of the American thrash metal movement, Megadeth rose to international fame in the 1980s, but experienced numerous line-up changes, due partly to the band's notorious substance abuse problems. After finding sobriety and securing a stable line-up, Megadeth went on to release a string of platinum and gold albums, including the platinum-selling landmark Rust in Peace in 1990 and the Grammy nominated, multi-platinum Countdown to Extinction in 1992. Megadeth disbanded in 2002 after Mustaine suffered a severe nerve injury to his left arm, but following extensive physical therapy, Mustaine reformed the band in 2004 and released The System Has Failed, followed by United Abominations in 2007; the albums deputed on the Billboard Top 200 chart at #18 and #8, respectively.

Megadeth is known for a distinctive guitar style, often involving complex, intricate musical passages, and trade off guitar solos. Mustaine is also known for his original ""snarling"" vocal style, as well as his recurring lyrical themes, often involving politics, war, addiction, and personal relationships.

As one of the most commercially successful heavy metal bands of all time, Megadeth has sold more than 20 million albums worldwide, including six consecutive platinum albums, with seven consecutive Grammy nominations for Best Metal Performance. In the band's 23 active years, Megadeth has had 20 official members, with Dave Mustaine remaining as the driving force, main songwriter, and sole original member following the end his musical partnership with Dave Ellefson in 2002. Megadeth is hailed as one of the bands among the ""Big Four of Thrash,"" along with Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, who were responsible for creating and popularizing the genre in the 1980s.

Just two months after Dave Mustaine was fired from Metallica in 1983, guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine formed the thrash metal quartet Megadeth. Though Megadeth followed the basic blueprint of Metallica's relentless attack, Mustaine's group distinguished themselves from his earlier band by adding an emphasis on instrumental skills, speeding the tempo up slightly, and making the instrumental attack harsher. By streamlining the classic thrash metal approach and making the music more threatening, as well as making the lyrics more nihilistic, Megadeth became one of the leading bands of the genre during the mid-'80s and late '80s. Each album they released went at least gold, and they continually sold out arenas across America, in addition to developing a strong following overseas. By the early '90s, they had toned their music down slightly, yet that simply increased their following; all of their proper '90s albums debuted in the Top Ten.

Throughout Megadeth's many lineup changes, the two core members were bassist Dave Ellefson and guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine (born September 13, 1961), who was the band's official leader. Mustaine grew up in the suburbs of Southern California, where he was raised by his mother in a broken home; frequently, his mother left him to be raised by aunts and uncles, who never encouraged his musical inclinations and often belittled him for his fondness for heavy metal. In 1981, he formed Metallica with James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. Mustaine spent two years with Metallica, developing a strong cult following in California's underground metal scene, before he was kicked out of the group in 1983, allegedly over his substance abuse.

For the next few years, Megadeth toured and gained a following, signing with the independent label Combat in late 1984. The following year, the group released their debut, Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!, which received strong reviews, not only in metal-oriented publications, but also in mainstream music magazines. The album sold very well for an independent release, which attracted the attention of major record labels. By the end of the year, the group had signed with Capitol. Megadeth's first major-label album, Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?, was released in the fall of 1986. Like its predecessor, Peace Sells was greeted by strong reviews and sales; it eventually went platinum.

In January 1988 Megadeth released So Far, So Good... So What!, and while the album was eventually certified platinum in the United States, it was initially panned by critics, with Allmusic complaining that the album ""lacked conceptual unity and musical bite"", and that it ""wants to sound threatening but mostly comes off as forced and somewhat juvenile"". So Far, So Good... featured the single ""In My Darkest Hour"", with music written by Mustaine as a tribute to fallen Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. The song remains a fan favorite, and has been performed at nearly every Megadeth show since. So Far, So Good... also featured a cover version of the Sex Pistols' ""Anarchy in the UK"", with lyrics altered by Mustaine (who later admitted to hearing them wrong).

In the years immediately following the release of So Far, So Good...So What!, Mustaine fired Jeff Young and Chuck Behler replacing them with guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza. This lineup recorded Megadeth's fourth and most progressive album, Rust in Peace. The record peaked at number 23 on the American charts and went platinum. 1991 saw Metallica break through to the mainstream, and sensing the possibility for similar success, Mustaine followed suit in stripping down the band's sound, though it remained as technically perfectionistic as Rust in Peace. The result, Countdown to Extinction, was released in 1992, entering the charts at number two; the record went double platinum and became the band's biggest hit, confirming that they had retained their audience in the wake of grunge.

Now one of the most popular metal bands in the world, Megadeth moved further toward the mainstream with Youthanasia in 1994, which entered the charts at number four and, like its predecessor, went platinum. The following year, the group released Hidden Treasures, a rarities collection that featured some of the soundtrack tunes that had helped expand the group's MTV audience in the early '90s. 1997's Cryptic Writings found Megadeth fully embraced by album rock radio, which formerly would never have touched the band. Ex-Suicidal Tendencies drummer Jimmy DeGrasso signed on in 1998, in time for the following year's Risk. In 200f0, following the release of the best-of Capitol Punishment, Marty Friedman followed Nick Menza out the door; he was replaced by former Savatage and Alice Cooper guitarist Al Pitrelli. After signing with the BMG subsidiary Sanctuary, Megadeth debuted its new lineup on 2001's The World Needs a Hero.

While on break from touring, Mustaine suffered a serious injury in January 2002 while staying in Texas. He was diagnosed with having radial neuropathy shortly thereafter, a condition that prevented him from playing guitar. The compressed radial nerves in his left arm and hand were strained, leaving Megadeth little recourse but to disband in April 2002, after almost 20 years in the music industry. During his time off, Mustaine prepared an elaborate reissue campaign, remastering each album and reissuing them all with bonus material. This campaign set the stage for a Megadeth revival, which came in 2004-2005 with a surprising comeback album, The System Has Failed, and some heavy touring. Capitol released a new best-of, simply titled Greatest Hits, just as Megadeth hit the summer concert circuit, headlining Mustaine's own Gigantour festival. In 2007 Megadeth released the politically charged United Abominations.

As of May 19, Megadeth had finished recording the album and on June 18, the album title was revealed to be Endgame. On May 27, 2009, Dave Mustaine confirmed all 12 songs are complete and they are currently mixing and mastering the record. As mentioned by Dave Mustaine on the syndicated radio show Infowars, the name of the album Endgame is an homage to the Alex Jones documentary of the same name.
The release date for the ""Endgame"" album was announced on the Megadeth official website as September 15, 2009, and Metal Hammer magazine's website were the first to review the album track by track. Megadeth began its Endgame tour on November 14, in Grand Rapids, Michigan and ended on December 13, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Tour featured Machine Head, Suicide Silence, Warbringer, and Arcanium.
In January 2010, Megadeth was set to embark on the ""American Carnage"" tour with Slayer and Testament, both giants of the thrash and heavy metal scene. The tour was scheduled to begin on January 18, but was ultimately postponed until later in the summer due to Tom Araya's back surgery.

Megadeth's ""Head Crusher"" was nominated for a 2010 Grammy.

Megadeth also announced a ""Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour"", which began on March 1 as a month-long North American tour with support from Testament and Exodus. During the tour, Megadeth played Rust In Peace in its entirety and Testament played The Legacy in its entirety. As of February 8, 2010, and prior to the start of the ""Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour"", original bassist Dave Ellefson rejoined Megadeth after eight years. He stated in an interview for Classic Rock magazine that Megadeth drummer Shawn Drover contacted him and had said that bassist James Lomenzo was declining and had told him that ""if ever there was a time for you and Dave to talk, now is it.""

In recent news, Megadeth have been working on a new song entitled ""Sudden Death"" and to which Mustaine claims ""won't be ready for a half a year at best."" However, it is due to appear in the video game Guitar Hero 6 this fall. On June 18th IGN posted a video showcasing the completed version of the song on the game. Megadeth are also due to release a 'Rust In Peace' Live DVD, recorded at the Hollywood Palladium, the set will be released on September 7th.

Megadeth, along with Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010 at Bemowo Airport (Warsaw, Poland). It was the first performance of that bands played as a part of Sonisphere Festival series, one of the following (Sofia, Bulgaria, June 22, 2010) was sent via satellite in HD to cinemas. They also went on to play in Athens, Greece (June 24, 2010), Bucharest, Romania (June 26, 2010) and then in Istanbul, Turkey (June 27, 2010) also as part of the Sonisphere Festival.

On September 24, 2010, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax began The Jägermeister Music Tour in Dallas, TX. Megadeth continued to play their 1990 album Rust In Peace in its entirety, while Slayer performed their Seasons in the Abyss album. On October 21, 2010, during the final show of Jägermeister Music Tour, Kerry King joined Megadeth on stage at the Gibson Amphitheater in Hollywood, California to perform Megadeth's classic ""Rattlehead"". This was the first time in 26 years that Kerry King had shared the stage with Megadeth since he played with the band during Megadeth's very first shows in 1984.

In an October 2010 interview with Crypt Magazine, Shawn Drover stated plans on another Megadeth album: ""Yeah, we’re certainly talking about it. Right now we’re in tour mode, but we’re starting to discuss our game plan for next year, and I envision next year we’ll be recording a new record."" Later that month, Roadrunner Records submitted several Megadeth songs for Grammy nominations. They submitted ""Sudden Death"" for Best Metal Performance, ""The Right to Go Insane"" for Best Hard Rock Performance, and ""Rust in Peace Live"" for Best Rock Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards. ""Sudden Death"" was nominated, making it the band's ninth Grammy nominated song.

On December 18, 2010, it was announced that Megadeth and Slayer would join forces once again for the European Carnage Tour in March and April 2011. Megadeth was also confirmed for the fourth annual Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival in July and August 2011. On January 25, 2011, another Big 4 show was announced, this time in the United States. The gig took place on April 23, 2011 in Indio, CA at the Empire Polo Club. At the time, this was the only scheduled stop in the US and was the first time all of the Big 4 members played on the same stage there. Shortly after the show, a second American show, to be held at at Yankee Stadium in New York, was announced.

During an online chat with members of the band's fan club, Mustaine revealed that the band had completed five new songs for the next album. Mustaine also noted that the new album was turning out to be ""more like Endgame"". In an online post during the Thirteen's recording, Shawn Drover noted that working with producer Johnny K (Staind, Sevendust) was a ""blast"" and that he ""shared the same vision for the new album"". In an interview with Pure Grain Audio, Mustaine said that the album would sound quite different from previous offerings, claiming that it was ""different, a hundred percent different"", and calling the sound ""really super-modern"". Mustaine went on to state that he believes that it will be the band's best album since Countdown to Extinction.

On June 3, 2011, it was announced that a new song, ""Never Dead"", was to be included in a trailer for the video game NeverDead. On July 4, 2011, in Hamburg, Megadeth debuted a new song entitled ""Public Enemy No. 1"". Public Enemy No. 1 was made available as a free single November 1, 2011, exclusively on iTunes.

Mustaine announced on July 8, 2011 that the new album would be entitled Thirteen, though it would be stylized as ""TH1RT3EN"" on the album cover. He also confirmed in an interview with Rolling Stone on July 12, 2011 that ""Sudden Death"" (which earlier appeared in the video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock), ""Never Dead"" and a title track, ""13"", would be included on the album.

In an interview KISW 99.9 FM in Seattle, Mustaine stated that, after 4 years of absence, there would be a new Gigantour tour in 2012. In October 2011 it was announced that Motörhead, Volbeat and Lacuna Coil will feature alongside Megadeth for the next Gigantour. In February 2012 Rob Zombie and Megadeth announced nine-date co-headlining U.S. tour scheduled for May 2012.

On September 11, 2012, it was announced that the band would re-release the Countdown to Extinction album for its 20th anniversary. Also announced was the band's 2012 fall tour in which the band would perform the album live in its entirety, similar to 2010's Rust in Peace anniversary tour. Additionally, in December 2012, another track from Thirteen, ""Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)"", was nominated for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 55th Grammy Awards, but ultimately lost to Halestorm's ""Love Bites (So Do I)"".

The band revealed on August 22, 2012, that they would be returning to the studio with producer Johnny K to record their fourteenth album. By December 2012, three new songs were ""tracked and almost done"". In 2013, Megadeth parted ways with Roadrunner Records for Mustaine's label, Tradecraft, distributed through Universal Music Group. Their fourteenth album, ""Super Collider"" was released on June 4 and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, making ""Super Collider"" the band's highest charting album since 1994's ""Youthanasia"".

Mustaine revealed that he is already thinking about a new Megadeth album, although ""Super Collider"" was released just 2 months prior. Mustaine says that the death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman gave him a sense of mortality, explaining: ""We're planning our next time to go into the studio to start demoing up our next record,"" and ""You know, time is short. Nobody knows how long they're gonna live. You see what happened with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can.""

In August 2013 the band announced a new live release, ""Countdown to Extinction: Live"", recorded at the Fox Theater in Pomona, CA in December 2012.

Otis Redding,"Otis Redding (Otis Ray Redding Jr., September 9, 1941 – December 10, 1967) was an American, highly influential, rhythm & blues and soul singer, and songwriter.
He is considered one of the greatest singers in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s. During his lifetime, his recordings were produced by Stax Records, based in Memphis, Tennessee, and exemplify the sound of Stax.
Redding received many posthumous accolades, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In addition to ""(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay,"" ""Respect"" and ""Try a Little Tenderness"" are among his best-known songs.

Redding was born in the small town of Dawson, Georgia. When he was 5, his family moved to Macon, Georgia. Redding sang in the choir at church, and as a teenager won the talent show at the Douglass Theatre for 15 weeks in a row. His early influences were Little Richard and Sam Cooke. Richard Pennyman (Little Richard) was also a Macon resident. Redding said, ""If it hadn't been for Little Richard, I would not be here. I entered the music business because of Richard; he is my inspiration. I used to sing like Little Richard, his Rock 'n' Roll stuff, you know. Richard has soul, too. My present music has a lot of him in it.""

In 1960, Redding began touring the South with Johnny Jenkins and The Pinetoppers. In addition to singing, Redding also served as Jenkins' driver since the bandleader did not possess a driver's license. That same year he made his first recordings, ""Fat Gal"" and ""Shout Bamalama"" with this group under the name ""Otis Redding and The Pinetoppers"" Issued on the Orbit and Confederate record labels before being picked up by King.

In 1962, Redding made his first real mark in the music business during a Johnny Jenkins session when, during studio time left over, he recorded ""These Arms of Mine"", a ballad that he had written. The song became a minor hit. on Volt Records, a subsidiary of the renowned Southern soul label Stax, based in Memphis, Tennessee.

Along with others such as Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, Eddie Floyd and Carla Thomas, Redding was a key exponent of the raw and electrifying ""Southern Fried"" soul sounds coming from Stax/Volt label. There were also similarities and interactions with Atlantic artists such as Solomon Burke, Arthur Conley, Percy Sledge and Aretha Franklin.

Redding's death in an air crash, aged just 26, deprived soul music of one of its most promising stars. His biggest hit single, and a breakthrough to a mainstream audience, (Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay, was released posthumously. Other notable tracks are I've Been Loving You Too Long, Try a Little Tenderness, Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song), Respect (also a big hit for Aretha Franklin), I Can't Turn You Loose, Mr Pitiful, Shake and Tramp (with Carla Thomas).

Unlike their Tamla Motown brethren, artists at Stax could still see cotton fields being worked outside the studio and were not as vigorously coached into ""white acceptable"" forms of expression by label policy. Thus, the concurrent Stax/Volt releases of the time tend to be less polished and formulaic, still managing to cross blurring color lines. Atlantic Records, based in New York, also did not try to 'manufacture' its artists in the Motown fashion.

""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" was recorded only three days before Redding's death. According to Nashid Munyan, curator of the Stax Museum of American Soul Music, Redding considered the song unfinished, having whistled the tune of one verse for which he intended to compose lyrics later. The song was released (with the place-holding whistling intact) in January 1968 and became Redding's only number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, and the first posthumous single in U.S. chart history. ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" was a significant stylistic departure from the bulk of his previous work, and might have presaged a change in direction for the singer.

Redding wrote many of his own songs, which was unusual for the time, often with Steve Cropper (of the Stax house band Booker T. and the MGs the main backing band of the Stax label, with the Bar-Kays filling the second slot. 

On December 9, 1967, Redding and his backup band, The Bar-Kays, made an appearance in Cleveland, Ohio on the local ""Upbeat"" television show. The next afternoon, Redding, his manager, the pilot, and four members of The Bar-Kays were killed when his Beechcraft 18 airplane crashed into Lake Monona in Madison, Wisconsin, on December 10, 1967. The two remaining Bar-Kays were Ben Cauley and James Alexander. Cauley was the only person aboard Redding's plane to survive the crash. Alexander was on another plane, since there were eight members in Redding's party and the plane could only hold seven, and it was Alexander's turn in the rotation to take a commercial flight.

Shortly after Redding's death, Atlantic Records, distributor of the Stax/Volt releases, was purchased by Warner Bros. Stax was required to renegotiate its distribution deal, and found that Atlantic actually owned the entire Stax/Volt back catalog.  Stax was unable to regain the rights to their recordings, and severed their relationship with Atlantic. Atlantic also retained the rights to all unreleased Otis Redding masters. 

Redding had recorded a massive amount of material in late 1967 just before his death (it was from these sessions that ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" emerged). Atlantic had enough material for three new Redding studio albums - The Immortal Otis Redding (1968), Love Man (1969), and Tell the Truth (1970) - which were all issued on Atlantic's Atco Records.  A number of successful singles emerged from these LPs, among them ""Amen"" (1968), ""Hard to Handle"" (1968), ""I've Got Dreams to Remember"" (1968), ""Love Man"" (1969), and ""Look at That Girl"" (1969). Singles were also lifted from two live Atlantic-issued Redding albums, In Person at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded in 1966 and issued 1968 on Atco, and Monterey International Pop Festival, a Reprise Records release featuring the live Monterey Pop Festival performances of The Jimi Hendrix Experience on side one and Redding on side two.

In 1993, the U.S. Post Office issued an Otis Redding 29 cents commemorative postage stamp. Redding was inducted in the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1994, and in 1999 he posthumously received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed three Redding recordings (""Shake,"" ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,"" and ""Try a Little Tenderness"") among its list of ""The 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.""

Eurythmics,"Eurythmics were a new wave duo from the United Kingdom, currently disbanded but known to reunite from time to time. Consisting of musician/producer David A. Stewart (often referred to as Dave Stewart) and singer-songwriter Annie Lennox, they formed in 1980 after the breakup of their former band The Tourists. Best known for their 1982 single ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" and album of the same name, they had a striking visual image, with Lennox having a very androgynous persona. They have described their music style as ""for intelligent dancers"".

Both Stewart and Lennox have had success, particularly as songwriters, outside of Eurythmics. They have sold over 75 million albums worldwide as a group. Eurythmics originally came together in 1980 and disbanded in 1990. They reunited in 1999 and split again in 2005.

After a Krautrock-inspired debut, their second and third albums were firmly in the electronic avant-garde of the time, somewhat akin to contemporaries such as The Human League and Ultravox, as befitting their striking visual style. Still, their albums 'Touch' and 'Sweet Dreams' sold very well and earned them a large fan following in the new wave scene, the strength of the song ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" (also known as just ""Sweet Dreams"") helping greately. Their fourth album (not counting the controversial soundtrack '1984') was 'Be Yourself Tonight', which became a commercial smash certified double platinum and planted them firmly in the synth pop genre in many people's minds. From this album came several popular singles, but ironically the single most lingering on playlists and on peoples' minds over the years has been the avant-garde single ""Sweet Dreams"".

Other popular tunes by the group include ""Don't Ask Me Why"", ""Would I Lie To You?"", ""Who's That Girl?"", and ""Here Comes The Rain Again"". Their style has been described variously as dance music, new wave, electropop, and the like with some songs having an aggressive rock inspiration. As well, Stewart was once notably married to former Bananarama and Shakespear's Sister member Siobhan Fahey.

In the 70s, Lennox and Stewart were a romantic couple. The complexities of their relationship over the years has fueled the emotionally cathartic nature of many of their songs.

The Flaming Lips,"The Flaming Lips are an American neo-psychedelic band, formed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States in 1983. Throughout their career, band members have come and gone, but currently The Flaming Lips consist of original members Wayne Coyne (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards) and Michael Ivins (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), along with members Steven Drozd (drums, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), and Derek Brown (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals). Former members include Mark Coyne (lead vocals), Richard English (drums, keyboards, backing vocals), Nathan Roberts (drums), Jonathan Donahue (guitar, backing vocals), who went on to form Mercury Rev, Ronald Jones (guitar, backing vocals), and Kliph Scurlock (drums).

The Flaming Lips are known for their lush, multi-layered arrangements, spacey lyrics and bizarre song titles. They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which typically feature animal suits, puppets, streamers, video projections and complex stage light configurations.

In 2002, Q magazine named The Flaming Lips one of the ""50 Bands to See Before You Die"". In 2006, Oklahoma City named a street Flaming Lips Alley in their honor.

The group recorded several albums and EPs for Restless Records in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a #9 hit on the Billboard Alternative charts (and #55 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart)  in 1994 with ""She Don't Use Jelly"". Although it would be their only hit single, the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability with sonically majestic albums such as 1995's Clouds Taste Metallic, 1999's The Soft Bulletin, 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots and 2006's At War with the Mystics. The Flaming Lips' 12th studio album, Embryonic, was released in October of 2009. A complete cover of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon was released in May 2010. The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends, their collaborative album which features artists like Ke$ha, Bon Iver, Nick Cave and Erykah Badu, was released on Record Store Day, April 2012. 

Their next studio album, tentatively titled The Terror, will be released in January 2013.

Their song ""Do You Realize??"" is the official State Rock Song of Oklahoma.

Johann Sebastian Bach,"Johann Sebastian Bach (March 31, 1685 – July 28, 1750) was a virtuoso German composer, organist, violinist, violist, harpsichordist from the Baroque period. Described by Mozart and Beethoven as one of the fathers of classical music, Bach's compositions include the Brandenburg Concertos, the Goldberg Variations, the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas. His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth. Bach's use of counterpoint was brilliant and innovative, and the immense complexities of his compositional style still amaze musicians today. His sacred & secular music, organ and choral works, and other instrumental music had an enthusiasm and seeming freedom that concealed immense rigor.

Bach was born in Eisenach in 1685. He was taught to play the violin and harpsichord by his father, Johann Ambrosius, a court trumpeter in the service of the Duke of Eisenach. Young Johann was not yet ten when his father died, leaving him orphaned. He was taken in by his recently married oldest brother, Johann Christoph, who lived in Ohrdruf. Because of his excellent singing voice, Bach attained a position at the Michaelis monastery at Lüneberg in 1700. His voice changed a short while later, but he stayed on as an instrumentalist. After taking a short-lived post in Weimar in 1703 as a violinist, Bach became organist at the Neue Kirche in Arnstadt (1703-1707). His relationship with the church council was tenuous as the young musician often shirked his responsibilities, preferring to practice the organ. One account describes a four-month leave granted Bach, to travel to Lubeck where he would familiarize himself with the music of Dietrich Buxtehude. He returned to Arnstadt long after was expected and much to the dismay of the council. He then briefly served at St. Blasius in Mühlhausen as organist, beginning in June 1707, and married his cousin, Maria Barbara Bach, that fall. Bach composed his famous Toccata and Fugue in D minor (BWV 565) and his first cantatas while in Mühlhausen, but quickly outgrew the musical resources of the town. He next took a post for the Duke of Sachsen-Weimar in 1708, serving as court organist and playing in the orchestra, eventually becoming its leader in 1714. He wrote many organ compositions during this period, including his Orgel-Büchlein. Owing to politics between the Duke and his officials, Bach left Weimar and secured a post in December 1717 as Kapellmeister at Cöthen. 

In 1720, Bach's wife suddenly died, leaving him with four children (three others had died in infancy). A short while later, he met his second wife, soprano Anna Magdalena Wilcke, whom he married in December 1721. She would bear 13 children, though only five would survive childhood. 

The six Brandenburg Concertos (BWV 1046-51), among many other secular works, date from his Cöthen years. Bach became Kantor of the Thomas School in Leipzig in May 1723 and held the post until his death. It was in Leipzig that he composed the bulk of his religious and secular cantatas. Bach eventually became dissatisfied with this post, not only because of its meager financial rewards, but also because of onerous duties and inadequate facilities. Thus, he took on other projects, chief among which was the directorship of the city's Collegium Musicum, an ensemble of professional and amateur musicians who gave weekly concerts, in 1729. He also became music director at the Dresden Court in 1736, in the service of Frederick Augustus II; though his duties were vague and apparently few, they allowed him freedom to compose what he wanted. Bach began making trips to Berlin in the 1740s, not least because his son Carl Philipp Emanuel served as a court musician there. In May 1747, the composer was warmly received by King Frederick II of Prussia, for whom he wrote the gloriously abstruse Musical Offering (BWV 1079). Among Bach's last works was his 1749 Mass in B minor. Besieged by diabetes, he died on 28th July 1750.

Chris Brown,"There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Christopher Maurice Brown (born May 5, 1989) from Tappahannock, Virginia.

In late 2005, he released his first studio album, Chris Brown, which spawned the Billboard Hot 100 number-one debut single, ""Run It!"" which was produced by Scott Storch and featured Juelz Santana. The album also produced two other top ten singles: ""Yo (Excuse Me Miss)"" and ""Say Goodbye."" Brown's second studio album, Exclusive was released worldwide in November 2007. It has spawned his second US number one hit, ""Kiss Kiss"" which was produced by T-Pain, who was also featured in the song .

Brown was influenced by the artists his parents played on the home radio, such as Michael Jackson and Sam Cooke. A dancer since the age of two, Brown was not aware of his vocal talents until the age of eleven. Before becoming a vocalist, he was interested in becoming a rapper.

At thirteen, Brown was discovered by a local production team who visited his father's gas station searching for new talent. Since then, he began his recording career and moved to New York, staying there for two years. Brown's local production team organized an audition before Def Jam Vice President Tina Davis, who currently works as his manager. At the age of 15, Brown was then sent to perform for L.A.

Santana,"Santana is a rock band based around talented guitarist Carlos Santana and founded in the late 1960s. The band first came to public attention after their performing the song ""Soul Sacrifice"" at the Woodstock Festival in 1969, when their Latin rock provided a contrast to other acts on the bill. This initial exposure made their first, eponymous album a hit at the time, followed in the next two years by successful follow-ups Abraxas and Santana III. Over the years, and despite a constantly changing line-up, Santana has achieved a total of eight Grammy Awards. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honored.

Santana was formed originally in 1967 in San Francisco, California. Carlos Santana is a Mexican-born American. Originally named The Santana Blues Band, they rose to international fame when they performed at the Woodstock festival in 1969. This led to their second studio album, Abraxas (1970), becoming a Latin-Rock standard and a huge critical and commercial success. Over the years their line-up has changed constantly, allowing them to evolve with the times. Over 50 musicians have been in Santana over its 40 year history, but the only constant has been Carlos Santana himself. Various successful bands have been spawned by Santana, most notably Journey, formed by keyboardist Gregg Rolie and guitarist Neal Schon, both key members of Santana's early days. Following a brief quiet period in the early 1990s, Santana returned to stardom by releasing two successful albums, Shaman and Supernatural, featuring various guest vocalists.

Santana's original drummer Michael Shrieve was one of the youngest performers at the Woodstock Music Festival in the year 1969 at only 19 years of age.

Carlos Santana is known to use Paul Reed Smith (PRS) custom guitars, though his choice varies according to co-players. On his last album, The Best of Santana, he played a Stratocaster to match with Eric Clapton's Strato-style. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Santana"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Caribou,"Caribou is Canadian Dan Snaith (b. 1978), who formerly recorded under the moniker Manitoba. Known for altering his sound with each subsequent release, he incorporates electronic psychedelia, krautrock rhythms, and breakbeat drums and creates a swirling, lush, musical panorama. Snaith also creates more club-oriented dance music under the name Daphni.

Snaith grew up in Dundas, Ontario, Canada, which gave its name to a song from his debut album Start Breaking My Heart. He studied at the University of Toronto as an undergrad, but was based in the UK for several years until he completed his Ph.D. in mathematics at the Imperial College, London in 2005.

Snaith previously recorded under the stage name ""Manitoba"", but changed it under threat of a lawsuit by Handsome ""Dick"" Manitoba, frontman for The Dictators, a punk-rocker with an appetite for litigation. Uninterested in the legal stoush, Snaith is quoted saying that he chose the new moniker ""Caribou"" while on an LSD trip with friends in the Canadian wilderness. He then climbed a tree and didn't come down until he finished his first album under the new moniker, which was four months later.

He has recorded five full lengths: Start Breaking My Heart, a jazzy, ""folktronica"" IDM album, Up in Flames, the critically acclaimed shoegazer with analog synths and sometimes live, sometimes sampled drums, The Milk of Human Kindness, his krautrock-inspired album that bleeds 70's prog and 70's drugscapes, the psychedelic pop record, Andorra which landed him the prestigious 2008 Polaris Music Prize on September 29th, 2008 and Swim a disco / dance inspired album created from the idea of making dance music that sounds like being under water. A few years prior to the recording of the album, Snaith's wife gave him swimming lessons as a Christmas present, prompting him to take it up as a new hobby. This partially led to the eventual ideology behind Swim.

His eclectic live performances are renowned, in part for their use of simultaneous drummers and synchronised visuals.  The live band currently consists of Dan Snaith (guitar, keyboards, vocals, drums, flutophone), Ryan Smith (guitar, keyboards), Brad Weber (drums) and John Schmersal (bass, vocals). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Caribou"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Tom Waits,"Tom Waits (born Thomas Alan Waits, in Pomona, California, on December 7, 1949) is a prolific American singer, songwriter, composer, and actor.

He started his career in the early 1970s as a singer in spit 'n' sawdust bars. Initially, he was deeply influenced by the beat generation, novelists like Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, and poets like Allen Ginsberg and Charles Bukowski.  Waits is often compared to Charles Bukowski, being similar both in content and lifestyle

Waits was unable to make a living from his music in the 70s because his classical bar music, based in pre-rock, and Americana, blues, and Vaudeville styles were not popular.  Waits's voice back then was soft, warm and clear. 

Waits subsequently developed a devoted cult following and has influenced subsequent songwriters, despite having little radio or music video support. In fact, his songs are perhaps best known to the general public in the form of cover versions of more visible artists, such as the Eagles, Bruce Springsteen and Rod Stewart. 

Although Waits’s albums have met with mixed commercial success in his native United States, they have occasionally achieved gold album sales status in other countries.

Lyrically, Waits's songs are known for atmospheric portrayals of seedy characters and places; he sings about the losers on the streets: alcoholics, junkies, prostitutes and social outcasts, although he also includes more conventional and touching ballads in his repertoire.  

While opening for Frank Zappa, the audience catcalled and refused to listen to him; he was an unsuitable match with Zappa's avantgarde style. 

Countless cigarettes, gallons of alcohol and many  all night parties eventually left their trace in his face and voice.

His more recent gravelly voice can be first heard on Small Change. This distinctive voice turned out to be his trademark. It is described by the Music Hound Rock Album Guide as sounding ""like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months and then taken outside and run over with a car"". Small Change with its sentimental ballads, its bar-jazz attitude and Film Noir-oriented stories turned out to be his biggest commercial success in the 1970s. 

Waits subsequently developed a more unique style. His songs have grown more abrasive since then, and the arrangements have turned more surreal and experimental with every new record.  His life brings him to new visions, as indicated by the direction taken in his ""Alice"" release.

While composing the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's One From The Heart Waits met Kathleen Brennan, his bride-to-be. They married in 1980 and she helped him quit drinking and smoking.  Since their marriage they have been working together on his albums as co-producers and co-writers. It is hard to say which part belongs to her and which to him, but it's easy to see that they make a perfect team.  Additionally, his eldest son Casey can be heard on turntables and percussion on Waits's album ""Real Gone"".

One of Waits's greatest successes was the album ""Swordfishtrombones"", released in 1983. It struck with his critics and fans alike. He achieved a new level of song writing and left former conventions (and his earlier career) behind. All songs, whether ballads, jive or jazz are played in a completely different way. It seems that Waits had taken the musical archetypes of these styles and made them his own. All tracks are in the quintessential Waits style. They have a striking rawness and listenability and they set the stage for his success and his future career. 

The Bad As Me Songfacts reports that 36 years after the release of Waits' first album, Closing Time in 1973, Bad As Me became Waits's first ever top 10 album in the US when it debuted at #6 with 63,000 sales. 

In the late 1980s Waits discovered an outlet for his creativity in composing musicals. His first Musical was named ""The Black Rider"", and is based on ""Der Freischütz"" by Carl Maria von Weber. It was co-produced by Robert Wilson and the lyrics come from William S. Burroughs. The story is slightly reminiscent of Kurt Weil's and Berthold Brecht's ""Three Penny Opera"" and the 1930s. The debut performance of the play was in 1990 at the Thalia Theater, Hamburg and has been played by various theatre groups since then.

Waits was also responsible for two other musicals, which later became albums released simultaneously in 2002. One was the musical ""Blood Money,"" which covers the ""Woyczek"" theme of Georg Büchner. This one is one of the darkest works from Waits. The other musical is based on Lewis Carroll's classic children's novel, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". ""Alice"" is very romantic, dreamy and soft, and contains one of Waits most romantic songs. Even though they were released at the same time, the bootlegs of the ""Alice"" musical were long before traded between fans and were just rearranged and re-mastered for the official release.

Besides many film contributions as composer – the Internet Movie Database imdb.com lists 47 appearances of Waits as composer and 38 soundtracks containing songs by Waits - he also is an actor with a total of 25 appearances, ranging from some mini-roles as a trumpeter in ""Heart of Saturday Night"" and the R. M. Renfield in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" to the major role of Zack in Jim Jarmusch's ""Down by Law"". He recently appeared in Roberto Benigni's ""The Tiger and the Snow"", playing You Can Never Hold Back Spring at Benigni's wedding dream.  Even more recently, Waits played Mr.Nick (the Devil) in Terry Gilliam's ""The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnussuss"".

In addition to a number of concert videos, he also appeared in the critically-acclaimed concert feature film ""Big Time"" (1990).

Waits has always refused to allow the use of his songs in commercials. He has filed several lawsuits against advertisers for using his material without permission. Waits also successfully sued an advertiser for using a work that was stylistically similar to his work, after he had declined to sell them the rights to his song. He has been quoted as saying, ""Apparently the highest compliment our culture grants artists nowadays is to be in an ad — ideally naked and purring on the hood of a new car.  I have adamantly and repeatedly refused this dubious honor.""

Kelly Clarkson,"Kelly Brianne Clarkson (born April 24, 1982 in Fort Worth, TX) is a Grammy-winning American singer-songwriter and occasional actress. Clarkson recorded her debut album with RCA Records after having won the highly-publicized first season of the television series American Idol in 2002. 

Though originally marketed as a pop musician, she eventually developed a more rock-oriented image.

Clarkson’s third album, entitled My December, was released in 2007. It peaked at #2 on the US and UK album charts. Her first single, Never Again, was released worldwide and reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #9 on the UK singles chart. She then released Sober in America, which did not perform as well on the charts as Never Again, peaking at #10 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100. One Minute was subsequently released in Australia, peaking at #36 on the Australian singles chart. Don’t Waste Your Time followed, peaking at #14 on the Australian singles chart. The album's somewhat disappointing performance may be attributed to ongoing negative press and poor publicity. Nonetheless, My December has been certified Platinum in the US, Australia and Canada, and Gold in the UK and Ireland.

Clarkson’s fourth album titled All I Ever Wanted was released in early 2009. Debuting at #1, it received favourable reviews from critics worldwide. The lead single, My Life Would Suck Without You, advanced from #97 to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in its first week of release, breaking the record for the largest leap to the position in chart history. This marks the second time Clarkson has broken that record, the first time being with her single A Moment Like This. My Life Would Suck Without You also reached #1 in the UK charts, making it her first #1 there. Her second single from the album, I Do Not Hook Up, peaked at #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #36 on the UK singles chart. The third single from the album, Already Gone, was released on August 11, 2009 in America and the 21st in Australia. It has so far peaked at #12 in Australia, #15 in Canada, #23 in New Zealand, #66 in the UK, #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 8 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary songs chart. All I Ever Wanted was announced as the fourth single from the album and was released on March 9, 2010. All I Ever Wanted has charted at #1 in the US, #2 in Australia and Canada, #3 in the UK and #6 in New Zealand, selling over 1.2 million copies worldwide so far. The album received a 2010 Grammy nomination for ""Best Pop Vocal Album.""

Mr. Know It All, the first single from Clarkson’s fifth album Stronger, debuted on August 30, 2011 during a live webcast hosted by the singer. The song was sent to radio for adds immediately after and was made available for download on September 5, 2011. It has since peaked in the top 20 of singles charts worldwide, including a #1 peak in South Korea, #1 in Australia, #4 in the UK, and #10 in the US, thus becoming her ninth top ten hit overall in the US. Stronger was released worldwide on October 24, 2011, charting at #2 in the US, #5 in the UK, #3 in Australia, and #4 in Canada. Stronger is her fifth consecutive album to debut within the top 3 in the US and has sold over a million copies worldwide since its release. Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You) was released in early 2012 to massive success; it became Clarkson's third #1 and tenth top-ten hit overall in the US, and likewise peaked in the top ten of countries worldwide. Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You) has since become Clarkson's biggest radio hit to date in the US and even topped the Billboard Dance charts, making Clarkson the only artist in history to have a #1 on Hot 100, Pop, Country, HAC, AC & Dance charts. Dark Side has since been announced and released as the album's third single worldwide.

In a career spanning over a decade, Clarkson has accumulated ninety-one number ones on the Billboard charts and eleven international number one singles, and has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. She is known for her vocal versatility and range. Her music has mainly dealt with themes of heartbreak, independence, and self-empowerment for women and young teens. Apart from her work in music, Clarkson has also ventured into television and film. Clarkson's film debut was in the romantic musical From Justin to Kelly (2003) and she also appeared in American Dreams as Brenda Lee, in Reba, on The Voice as a guest advisor, on Duets as a mentor and judge. Clarkson's musical work has also gained her numerous accolades, including three Grammy Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, twelve Billboard Music Awards, four American Music Awards, two Academy of Country Music Awards, two American Country Awards, and a Women's World Award. In 2012, Clarkson was ranked nineteenth on VH1's list of ""100 Greatest Women in Music.""

Whitney Houston,"Whitney Houston (born on August 9, 1963 in Newark, New Jersey, death announced February 11, 2012 in Los Angeles, California) was a Grammy and Emmy Award winning American R&B/pop singer, actress, former fashion model, record and movie producer. Whitney Houston is one of pop music's best-selling music artists of all-time, with more than 200 million combined albums, singles, and videos sold worldwide. She was known for her soulful dramatic mezzo-soprano voice, vocal power, range and melismatic skill.  She was labeled the ""Queen of Songs"" by Arsenio Hall, who described her as ""the first lady of song"". She was also known to millions as ""The Voice"", a nickname given to her by Oprah Winfrey. Also known as the ""Queen of Pop/Soul"", or soulful-pop music. 

Whitney's debut album was released in 1985 to critical and commercial international success, and she went on to release seven consecutive number-one hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of a handful of African-American artists who received heavy-rotation on MTV during the network's early years in the 1980s.

Houston continued her success into the 1990s with the release of several films and their corresponding soundtrack albums, the most popular of which was The Bodyguard (1992), which produced the worldwide number-one hit single I Will Always Love You. According to the  I Will Always Love You Songfacts, it stayed at US #1 for 14 weeks, which was a record at the time and for a while was second to ""We Are The World"" as the biggest-selling single ever. Houston's albums in the 2000s have been less successful.

Her personal life became the subject of controversy because of allegations of drug abuse, especially after repeated cancellations of public appearances and erratic behaviour.

Moderat,"Moderat are Modeselektor and Apparat.

Moderat's formation began back in 2002 in Berlin, Germany when Sascha Ring (aka Apparat) and Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary (aka Modeselektor) recorded an EP for the record label BPitch Control (""Auf Kosten der Gesundheit""). When it came time to begin working on an album, Moderat suddenly broke up.

Meanwhile Modeselektor set a milestone in German music history with their sophomore album, Happy Birthday!, including musicians such as Puppetmastaz, Maximo Park and Thom Yorke. Amongst a slew of remixes for the likes of Thom Yorke and Björk, Modeselektor also went on to tour with Radiohead across Japan in 2008.

Apparat, on the other hand, moved forward with his album Walls in 2007 (after his collaboration with Ellen Allien on ""Orchestra of Bubbles""), taking a musical path that was more band-oriented and kept him on tour for several years running.

2008 saw the reunion of this project and the three members of Moderat went back to the studio to continue working together and finally released their 1st full album ""Moderat"" in April 2009. This is a monumental 'audio-visual declaration' album, which includes ten videos by Berlin's highly regarded visualists Pfadfinderei.

Slayer,"Slayer is a thrash metal band from US, formed in 1981. The band was founded by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. The band was credited as one of the ""Big Four"" thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Anthrax, and Megadeth.

Slayer's musical traits involve fast tremolo picking, guitar solos, double bass drumming, and shouting vocals. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as death, deviants, suicide, genocide, necrophilia, insanity, Nazism, religion, Satanism, serial killers, and warfare have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and strong criticism from religious groups and the general public. Slayer is best known for speaking through perspective without being necessarily sympathetic to the cause of their inspiration. 

Since their debut record in 1983, the band has released two live albums, one cover album, one box set, three DVDs, one VHS, two EPs, and eleven studio albums, four of which have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received three Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song ""Eyes of the Insane"", and one in 2008 for the song ""Final Six"". They have headlined music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance and Ozzfest.

Slayer was formed in 1981 in Huntington Park, Los Angeles, California. The Band was formed by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King when they met at a tryout for a local band. Tom Araya soon joined on bass and vocals, and drummer Dave Lombardo joined last later in 1982. They played in a style reminiscent of early Exodus, influenced heavily by punk acts Minor Threat, Stooges  and Heavy Metal bands Venom and Judas Priest.

""Black Magic"", the heaviest, darkest, and most evil song at the time (according to some), was written in February, 1983, and marked Slayer's definite venture into thrash metal. They secured a spot on the compilation appeareance ""Metal Massacre III"" in 1983, contributing the speed metal song ""Aggressive Perfector"". They also recorded two demos in 1983, and became a popular live act in the Los Angeles area. (In 1983, Bob Gourley filled in for Dave for one gig. He later appeared in Dark Angel (US).) Their debut LP, Show No Mercy, was recorded in November, 1983.)

A live EP was recorded in the studio in front of 50 of their closest friends in January, 1984, and after that ""Show No Mercy"" was released. The ""Haunting the Chapel"" and ""Live Undead"" EPs followed.

After 1985's ""Hell Awaits"", Slayer were signed to Rick Rubin's Def Jam record label, better known for acts like Run DMC. This led to three studio albums, including the brutal ""Reign in Blood"", as well as a 1991 live double CD, ""Decade of Aggression"".

Dave Lombardo left the band in 1987 for several weeks, and was replaced for a few live gigs by Tony Scaglione (Whiplash (US)), and then again left in 1992. Finally, in 1994, Paul Bostaph from Forbidden was brought in, and three more albums were recorded.

Then, in 2001, Bostaph left to join Systematic, and Lombardo, who had been in Grip Inc. and Fantomas rejoined the band.

Interesting facts:

It's official that Slayer is the most covered metal band in the world aside from Metallica and Iron Maiden.

Tom Araya (born Tomas Enrique Araya June 6, 1961 in Vina del Mar, Chile. He has provided guest vocals to recordings by other artists, including ""Iron Gland"" from Alice in Chains' album Dirt, and ""Terrorist"" from Soulfly's album Primitive. His brother is John Araya (Bloodcum (US), Thine Eyes Bleed)

Kerry King recorded a guitar solo for ""No Sleep Til' Brooklyn"" by the popular hip-hop/rock group Beastie Boys.

Tom Araya's brother John (Bloodcum (US), Thine Eyes Bleed) worked as an sound engineer for Slayer in their early days.

According the book of Jarek Szubrycht (Lux Occulta) ""Bez litosci. Prawdziwa historia zespo?u Slayer"", Greg Hall was asked to play with Slayer after Tony Scaglione left the band in January 1987. It never happens because Lombardo returned to the band.

Gene Hoglan, the legendary drummer who has played in bands such as Dark Angel (US), Strapping Young Lad and Death, used to be a Slayer lights man and roadie on the Show No Mercy tour, and was asked to be Dave Lombardo's drum tech on the Haunting North America tour ('84), but knocked it back to pursue his own music career. He even did backup vocals on the album Show No Mercy (the song Evil Has No Boundaries).

Birth Dates:
Tom Araya (06 June 1961 Vina del Mar, Chile)
Jeff Hannemann (31 January 1964 Oakland, CA)
Kerry King (03 June 1964 Los Angeles, CA)
Dave Lombardo (16 February 1965 Havana, Cuba)
Paul Bostaph (26 March 1964 Newark, CA)+

Rumor has it the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the 1981 movie of the same name. However, when King was asked ""How did you come up with the name Dragonslayer?"" King responded ""We never did; it's a myth to this day."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Slayer"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Train,"Train is a Grammy Award winning rock band formed in San Francisco, California. To date, three of their albums have peaked in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 and have sold a total of over 4 million albums in the US. Four of their songs have been top 20 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 including their highest charting (#3) and best selling (certified 5x Multi-Platinum by the RIAA) worldwide hit ""Hey, Soul Sister."" Train has found success on modern adult contemporary radio stations, where they have had four #1 songs on the Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart, the latest being to date their most successful (peaking at #34) secondary single off an album, ""If It's Love.""

What started as two guys with strong voices and one guitar became San Francisco's Train by 1994. It was in late 1993 that Patrick Monahan left Erie, PA, and met up with the Los Angeles band, The Apostles. Lead singer/guitarist Rob Hotchkiss and fellow guitarist Jim Stafford had basically disbanded by this time, but the chance meeting with Patrick Monahan proved fortuitous, as Hotchkiss extended an invitation to the crooning Monahan to become a two-man band. After making exhaustive appearances in low-key coffeehouses, they decided to form a full band and enlisted former Apostles members Stafford and bassist Charlie Colin. Colin brought along his good friend, drummer Scott Underwood, and Train were on their way. 

Train settled in San Francisco to develop their sound in a relaxed, laid-back atmosphere. In an unlikely scenario, executives from Columbia Records expressed an interest and, in a somewhat cooperative strategy, farmed the fledgling band out to the minors -- in this instance, Aware Records -- where they could grow naturally and unhurriedly. In 1997, they went on tour, opening for the likes of Blues Traveler, Barenaked Ladies, and Counting Crows. Train knew they had arrived when they sold out a performance at San Francisco's prestigious Fillmore venue. Their completed debut album was released the following year. Drops of Jupiter followed three years later, becoming a 2x Platinum hit on the back of its single of the same name. My Private Nation followed in 2003. Though response was initially weak, the single ""Get to Me"" eventually caught fire, and Train had their latest Billboard chart hit. A holdover live album appeared in 2004 while the band returned to the studio to record My Private Nation's follow-up. The single ""Cab"" announced the band's return in late 2005, with the full-length For Me It's You following early the next year. 

From November 2006, the band took a break from recording and touring to be with friends and family. Lead singer Pat Monahan released a solo album, Last of Seven, on September 18, 2007. The first single, ""Her Eyes,"" was released in July. 

On October 27, 2009, Train not only released proof that they were once again a band, but also put their fifth studio album on the market, Save Me San Francisco. Dedicated to get back to where they came from, the album revisited the roots rock sound that has made the band such a tour de force. The album is a tribute to the city that made them who they are today and pays homage to the city by the bay that they owe so much. 

The first single from Train's sixth studio album, ""Drive By,"" was made available on iTunes January 10, 2012, a week after Train played the halftime show at the 2012 Discover Orange Bowl in Miami. This upbeat pop/rock tune was the first song to be released from Train's sixth studio album. It was already familiar to some of their fans as the band had been performing the tune during their 2011 Summer Tour. Train's singles tend to gradually build momentum, but this song debuted at #60 on the Hot 100 in its first week as Triple A, hot AC, and pop radio all embraced the song with enthusiasm.

Grouplove,"Grouplove is an indie pop band which formed in 2009 in Los Angeles, California, United States. The band consists of Christian Zucconi (vocals, guitar), Hannah Hooper (vocals, keyboards), Andrew Wessen (vocals, guitar), Sean Gadd (bass, vocals), and Ryan Rabin (drums). The band released their debut album, Never Trust a Happy Song, in September 2011, which was followed by Spreading Rumours, released September 2013. Both albums were produced by the band's drummer Ryan Rabin, who is the son of former Yes guitarist and film composer Trevor Rabin.

Hannah Hooper met Christian Zucconi late one evening on the lower east side of Manhattan. They had both been living in New York for years and had never crossed paths before. But from that night forward the two could hardly be pulled apart. Soon after their connection, Hooper was invited to an art residency in Greece on the island of Crete and Hooper insists ""without any hesitation"" she invited Zucconi to join her on this journey. ""Seriously, we had only known one another for a few days but are both so inspired and alive when we are together that going to Greece seemed like a magical and natural thing to do,"" recalls Zucconi.

On Crete, in a small remote mountain village, Hooper and Zucconi met the members of their future band ""GROUPLOVE"" a year before it was officially formed. Sean Gadd, a natural songwriter and guitar player, born and bred in London instantly bonded with the two eccentric New Yorkers. Their relationship became apparent through the music they were making day in and day out. Andrew Wessen, a pro surfer and musician from Los Angeles and his childhood friend Ryan Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, were also at the residency and quickly joined in with the musical trio. These five musicians make up the members of what we now know as GROUPLOVE .

Like all good things, the summer and the residency came to an end and the five friends scattered back to their homes all over the globe. With Sean in London, Christian and Hannah in Brooklyn and Ryan and Andrew in Los Angeles GROUPLOVE was faced with the challenge of what to do now. ""We all understood how rare it is for five strangers to feel as close as family and create passionate music together. We couldn't just return to Brooklyn and let the music we all made fade into a memory of that summer we had in Greece,"" explains Zucconi. Everyone pulled their funds together and Sean, Christian and Hannah made their way to Ryan Rabin's studio in LA to record their album. ""We seriously had the best time of our lives doing that record,"" says Gadd. And the result is an incredibly special album where soaring harmonies coupled with sweeping anthems lead you through their powerful journey. Like the members of GROUPLOVE, their music is diverse in influence and style but bonded together by an undeniably creative kinship.

Their experience back together and recording together was so potent that Hooper and Zucconi packed up their lives in Brooklyn and Gadd packed up his life in London and they all moved to LA to live and play their music.

""We never could have dreamt this up,"" says Zucconi, ""but at the same time we're not at all surprised - GROUPLOVE is meant to be. Our story a testament to fate, and our music is something we are ready to share."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Grouplove"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Head and the Heart,"The Head and the Heart is a folk band which formed in 2009 in Seattle, Washington, United States. The band consists of Josiah Johnson (vocals, guitar), Jonathan Russell (vocals, guitar), Charity Rose Thielen (violin, vocals), Chris Zasche (bass), Kenny Hensley (keyboards) and Tyler Williams (drums).

Composed primarily of transplants to the Seattle area, The Head and the Heart write and play songs that speak to the newness of a fresh start, of the ghosts left behind, of moving forward, all brimming with a soulfulness and hope for a better life than the one we've all been sold.

Stylistically, think a folksy Beatles or The Avett Brothers with a little extra oomph. Catchy piano melodies stand side by side with a tight trio of harmonies, and solid minimalist drums, groovin' bass, and plenty of hand percussion and foot stomps make the live show inspiring and really goddamn fun.

After the band self-released its eponymous debut album in June 2010, the emblematic Seattle label Sub Pop re-released the album. For the Sub Pop version, the song “Sounds like Hallelujah” has been re-recorded, live favorite “Rivers and Roads” has been added, and the album has been re-mastered. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Head+and+the+Heart"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bill Withers,"Bill Withers (born July 4, 1938 in Slab Fork, West Virginia) is an American singer-songwriter who performed and recorded from the late 1960s until the mid 1980s.

Bill's father died when he was thirteen. He joined the US Navy at seventeen, and stayed there for nine years, before he moved to Los Angeles in 1967. While in Los Angeles, he worked full-time in a Lockheed assembly plant in the day, recording demo tapes and performing in juke joints during the night. When he debuted on the music scene with ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" he refused to give up his job at Lockheed because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other working acts like The Temptations or Sammy Davis, Jr.

His first success was with the company Sussex Records in 1971 with his debut hit single Ain't No Sunshine on the album Just As I Am. He assembled a touring band made up of: drummer James Gadson, guitarist Bernoce Blackmon, keyboardist Ray Jackson, and bassist Melvin Dunlap.

His second album Still Bill also did well on the charts. It was recorded during a break in the ""Just As I Am"" tour and included the well-known single ""Lean on Me,"" which went to #1 on the charts on July 8, 1972. His live album, ""Bill Withers, Live at Carnegie Hall,"" released in 1973, was one of the best live albums to be released during the 1970s. Other popular songs he sings are ""Use Me"" and ""Lovely Day,"" as well as ""Just the Two of Us,"" which he performed with jazz saxophonist Grover Washington Jr.

His songs have been covered by many singers and rappers. Club Nouveau's 1986 cover of ""Lean on Me,"" which is now often used in many churches, earned Withers his third Grammy as a songwriter. Ten years earlier, the British glam rock band Mud took the song to No. 7 in the UK pop charts. Grace Jones covered his song ""Use Me."" Fiona Apple has also covered ""Use Me"" and ""Kissing My Love"" on her 1998 tour. Me'Shell Ndegeocello sang ""Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?"" on her 1996 album ""Peace Beyond Passion."" Will Smith samples Bill's ""Just the Two of Us"" in his 1997 song of the same name, and ""Lovely Day"" with the song ""Lovely Daze,"" (a collaboration with DJ Jazzy Jeff released in 1998). 

The Country singer Kenny Rogers covered ""Ain't No Sunshine"" in 1999. Kanye West sampled his song ""Rosie"" in the song Roses"". Twista sampled ""Lovely Day"" in the hit single ""Sunshine"" featuring Anthony Hamilton. Over the Rhine toured a cover of Ain't No Sunshine"" during 2004 and recorded this on their album ""Changes Come."" When playing live, the band Eskimo Joe often begins their song ""A Song is a City"" with Kav singing ""Ain't No Sunshine"" as a prelude. Bill's song ""Use Me"" is also featured in the film ""Anchorman."" The start of the Blackstreet hit ""No Diggity"" features a sample of Bill's poem-turned-song ""Grandma's Hands.""

To this day, his most popular songs, including ""Lovely Day,"" ""Lean On Me"" and ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" have been used in countless television advertisements, thereby increasing his popularity as a well-respected artist. He remains one of the most significant and respected singer-songwriters of the 20th Century. Some of his songs, particularly ""Lean On Me"" and ""Use Me"", have been performed in churches because of their lyrics covering spirituality and unity. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ludwig van Beethoven,"Ludwig van Beethoven (16 December 1770 – 26 March 1827) was a German pianist and composer of the transitional period between the late Classical and early Romantic eras. 
He remains one of the most brilliant, prolific and influential composers of all time.
Beethoven is widely regarded as a master of musical construction, sometimes sketching the architecture of a movement before he had decided upon the subject matter. He was one of the first composers to systematically and consistently use interlocking thematic devices, or 'germ-motives', to achieve unity between movements in long compositions. (Some insight into the meaning of the germ-motive device is given at the end of this bio.)  Equally remarkable was his use of source-motives', which recurred in many different compositions and lent some unity to his life’s work. He made innovations in almost every form of music he touched. For example, he diversified even the well-crystallised form the rondo, making it more elastic and spacious, which brought it closer to sonata form. He was mostly inspired by the natural course of nature, and liked to write songs describing nature.

Beethoven composed in a great variety of genres, including symphonies, concerti, piano sonatas, other instrumental sonatas (including for violin), string quartets and other chamber music, masses, lieder, and one opera.

Beethoven's compositional career is usually divided into Early, Middle, and Late periods:

In the Early (Classical) period, he is seen as emulating his great predecessors Haydn and Mozart, while concurrently exploring new directions and gradually expanding the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the Early period are the first and second symphonies, the first six string quartets, the first three piano concertos, and the first twenty piano sonatas, including the famous ""Pathétique"" and ""Moonlight"" sonatas.

The Middle (Heroic) period began shortly after Beethoven's personal crisis centering around his encroaching deafness. The period is noted for large-scale works expressing heroism and struggle; these include many of the most famous works of classical music. Middle period works include six symphonies (numbers 3 to 8), the fourth and fifth piano concertos, the triple concerto and violin concerto, five string quartets (numbers 7 to 11), the next seven piano sonatas (including the ""Waldstein"" and the ""Appassionata""), and Beethoven's only opera, Fidelio.

Beethoven's Late (Romantic) period began around 1816. The Late-period works are characterised by intellectual depth, intense and highly personal expression, and formal innovation (for example, the Op. 131 string quartet has seven linked movements, and the Ninth Symphony adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement). Many people in his time period do not think these works measured up to his first few symphonies, and his works with J. Reinhold were frowned upon. Works of this period also include the Missa Solemnis, the last five string quartets, and the last five piano sonatas.

Destructuring the sonata form, both in the overall schema (movements, tempos) and in the micro-form, Beethoven began to use germinal ideas propelling the whole melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic progression. In the first quartet of the group (E flat major, Op.127 – February 1825), the Adagio has five variations (in this case, a source-theme becomes the backbone of the tempo). That same year, in July, Quartet in A minor, Op.132, features a first movement with the traditional two themes, but without contrast; they display and disseminate sub-sections and ‘germs’ in a circular frame, interlocking with each other.  Beethoven's germ-motive is like a Bach choral, summoning the other voices around itself.  

The last quartet, Op. 135 in F major, was composed in a downplayed form, going back to a more traditional four-tempo structure. But internally one finds the same frozen micro-structure: the first movement is harmonically ambiguous, whereas the scherzo sounds like Bartòk, and in the finale, the canon ‘Es muss sein’ plays a joyful role. A terrible grave comes in afterward, to dissolve into a soft pizzicato: adieu music, adieu life . It was never heard by the now deaf Beethoven, and he died shortly afterward. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ludwig+van+Beethoven"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Jeff Buckley,"Jeffrey Scott ""Jeff"" Buckley (born in Anaheim, California, USA on 17 November 1966 – 29 May 1997), raised as Scotty Moorhead, was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. He was the son of musicians Tim Buckley and Mary Guibert.

He had emerged in New York City's avant-garde club scene in the 1990s as one of the most remarkable musical artists of his generation, acclaimed by audiences, critics, and fellow musicians alike. His first commercial recording, the four-song EP Live At Sin-é, was released in December 1993 on Columbia Records. The EP captured Buckley, accompanying himself on electric guitar, in a tiny coffeehouse in New York's East Village, the neighbourhood he'd made his home.

Buckley made his public singing début at a tribute concert for his father called ""Greetings from Tim Buckley"". The event, produced by show business veteran Hal Willner, was held at St. Ann's Church in Brooklyn on 26 April 1991.

By the time of the EP's release during the fall of 1993, Buckley had already entered the studio with Mick Grondahl (bass), Matt Johnson (drummer), and producer Andy Wallace and recorded seven original songs (including ""Grace"" and ""Last Goodbye"") and three covers (among them Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"", Benjamin Britten's ""Corpus Christi Carol"") that comprised his debut album Grace. Guitarist Michael Tighe became a permanent member of Jeff Buckley's ensemble and went on to co-write and perform on Grace's ""So Real"" just prior to the release of the album.

In early 1994, not long after Live At Sin-é appeared in stores, Jeff Buckley toured clubs, lounges, and coffeehouses in North America as a solo artist from January 15th to March 5th as well as in Europe from March 11th to 22th. Following extensive rehearsals in April to May of 1994, Buckley's ""Peyote Radio Theatre Tour"" found him on the road with his band from June 2nd to August 16th. His full-length full-band album, Grace, was released in the United States on August 23rd, 1994, the same day Buckley and band kicked off a European tour in Dublin, Ireland; the 1994 European Tour ran through September 22nd, with Buckley and band performing at the CMJ convention at New York's Supper Club on September 24. The group headed back into America's clublands for a Fall Tour lasting from October 19th until December 18th.

On New Year's Eve 1994-95, Buckley returned to Sin-é to perform a solo set; on New Year's Day, he read an original poem at the annual St. Mark's Church Marathon Poetry Reading. Two weeks later, he and his band were back in Europe for gigs in Dublin, Bristol, and London before launching an extensive tour of Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Holland, Belgium, and the United Kingdom which lasted from January 29th to March 5th. On April 13th 1995, it was announced that Jeff Buckley's Grace had earned him France's prestigious ""Gran Prix International Du Disque -- Academie Charles CROS -- 1995""; an award given by a jury of producers, journalists, the president of France Culture, and music industry professionals, it had previously been given to Edith Piaf, Jacques Brel, Yves Montand, Georges Brassens, Bruce Springsteen, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Joni Mitchell, among other musical luminaries. France also awarded Buckley a gold record certification for Grace.

From March 5th through April 20th, Buckley and his band rehearsed for an American spring tour with gigs running from April 22th until June 2nd. From June through August, Jeff and company toured the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Switzerland. The band took off for Down Under to play six Australian shows between August 28th and September 6th, 1995. In November 1995, Buckley played two unannounced solo shows at Sin-é. He performed songs including the new ""Woke Up In A Strange Place"" on Vin Scelsa's ""Idiot's Delight"" show on WXRK-FM on December 17 and celebrated New Year's Eve 1995-96 with performances at New York's Mercury Lounge and Sin-é.

Jeff Buckley and his touring ensemble went back to Australia, where Grace had earned a gold record certification, for the ""Hard Luck Tour,"" which ran from February 9th to March 1st of 1996. Drummer Matt Johnson left the group after the final Australian show. The posthumous album Mystery White Boy brings together some of the high points from Jeff's 1995-1996 live performances. The DVD/home video release Live In Chicago documents, in its entirety, Jeff's concert at The Cabaret Metro in Chicago on May 13th, 1995.

In May of '96, Jeff played four gigs as a bass player with Mind Science of the Mind, a side-project of Buckley's friend, Nathan Larson of Shudder To Think. In September Buckley played another unannounced solo gig at his old favorite haunt Sin-é. December of 1996 found Jeff Buckley embarking on his ""phantom solo tour""; designed to experiment with new songs in a live setting (as in his Sin-é days), these unannounced solo gigs throughout the Northeast U.S. were played under a succession of aliases: the Crackrobats, Possessed By Elves, Father Demo, Smackrobiotic, the Halfspeeds, Crit Club, Topless America, Martha & the Nicotines, and A Puppet Show Named Julio.

At midnight on February 9th, 1997, Jeff Buckley debuted his new drummer, Parker Kindred, in a show at Arlene Grocery on New York's Lower East Side. He also played a couple of solo gigs in New York during the first months of 1997: a gig at the Daydream Cafe (featuring band members Mick Grondahl and Michael Tighe as ""special guests"") and a solo performance February 4th as part of the Knitting Factory's 10-Year Birthday Party.

Buckley and his band had recorded intermittently — with Tom Verlaine as producer — during Summer/Fall 1996 and early winter 1997 in New York and in February 1997 in Memphis. After the conclusion of those sessions, Jeff sent the band back to New York while, during March and April 1997, he remained in Memphis and continued to craft his work-in-progress, making various four-track home recordings of songs to present to his bandmates. Some of these were revisions of the songs recorded with Verlaine, some were brand new compositions, and some were surprising cover versions. The new lineup debuted Buckley's new songs at Barrister's in Memphis on February 12th and 13th. Beginning March 31st, Jeff began a series of regularly scheduled Monday night solo performances at Barrister's. His last show there was on Monday, May 26th, 1997.

Buckley passed away in a drowning accident in the Wolf River, a tributary of the Mississippi River, on May 29th, 1997. The night Buckley died, he was on his way to meet his band to begin three weeks of rehearsals for My Sweetheart, the Drunk; producer Andy Wallace, who'd helmed the boards on Grace, was to join them in Memphis in late June to record his new album.

In addition to his Columbia Records releases, Live At Sin-é and Grace, Jeff Buckley has appeared as a guest artist on several other recordings. He can be heard singing ""Jolly Street,"" a track on the Jazz Passengers 1994 album In Love. He contributed tenor vocals to ""Taipan"" and ""D. Popylepis,"" two recordings on John Zorn's Cobra Live At The Knitting Factory (1995). On Rebecca Moore's Admiral Charcoal's Song, Buckley plays electric six-string bass on ""If You Please Me,"" ""Outdoor Elevator,"" and ""Needle Men"" (on which he also plays drums). He both plays guitar and sings backup vocals on Brenda Kahn's ""Faith Salons,"" a key track on her Destination Anywhere album (released 1996). Patti Smith's critically acclaimed Gone Again album features Buckley adding ""voice"" to the song ""Beneath the Southern Cross"" and ""essrage"" (a small fretless Indian stringed instrument) to ""Fireflies."" On Kerouac: Kicks Joy Darkness, a various artists' spoken word tribute to beat poet Jack Kerouac, Jeff Buckley performed on ""Angel Mine""; Jeff plays guitar, sitar, and mouth sax (adding words at the poem's conclusion) on the track. Buckley can be heard reading Edgar Allan Poe's ""Ulallume - A Ballad,"" on Closed on Account of Rabies: Poems and Tales of Edgar Allan Poe (disc 2: The Devil's Brew) (Poems & Tales by Edgar Allan Poe) on Mouth Almighty/Mercury Records. He sang ""I Want Someone Badly"" (Epic) for Shudder To Think's soundtrack to First Love, Last Rites. Sandy Bell, a friend of Buckley's during his L.A. days, released the resurrected track ""Hollywould"" in 2000, which she co-wrote and recorded with Buckley.

An ardent enthusiast for a myriad of musical forms, Jeff Buckley was an early champion among young American musicians for the work of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the world's foremost Qawwali (the music of the Sufis) singer. Buckley conducted an extensive interview with Nusrat in Interview magazine (January 1996) and wrote the liner notes Nusrat's The Supreme Collection album, released on Mercator/Caroline records in August 1997. On May 9th, 2000, Columbia Records released Mystery White Boy, an album of live performances, and Live In Chicago, a full-length concert (available on DVD or VHS) recorded live at The Cabaret Metro in Chicago on May 13, 1995, in the middle of Jeff's ""Mystery White Boy"" tour.

Following the release of Grace on August 23rd, 1994, Jeff and his group spent much of 1994-1996 performing around the world on the Unknown, Mystery White Boy, and Hard Luck tours. Mystery White Boy brings together, for the first time, some of the high points of those shows. Produced by Michael Tighe (guitarist for Jeff's band throughout their international touring and the recording of Grace) and Mary Guibert (Jeff's mother) and Mystery White Boy provides an evocative cross-section of Jeff's repertoire: previously-unreleased Buckley compositions, electrifying live interpretations of songs from Grace, and obscure and marvelous cover choices. The recordings heard on Mystery White Boy have been hand-picked from scores of concert tapes by Mary Guibert and the members of Jeff's band who played such a large role in helping Jeff realize his musical vision.

According to Mary, the tracks on Mystery White Boy are ""the individual performances that represented transcendent moments from each of the concerts we'd identified as being in the 'overall outstanding' category.""

""It was obvious which performances were contenders for the record,"" concurs Michael Tighe, ""and in some cases a performance would be so supreme and unpredictable that I knew it had to be brought to the public.""

The posthumous album Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk was released in 1998 and included songs Buckley was working on while in Memphis for his upcoming release.

Awolnation,"AWOLNATION is an American indie rock band from Los Angeles, CA, USA, active since 2009, and is the solo project of Aaron Bruno, formerly of Under the Influence of Giants and Home Town Hero. The Sail Songfacts reports that Bruno used to leave high school without saying goodbye to his friends because it was easier, so they used to nickname him 'Awol' (absence without leave). When Bruno decided to form his own band, he decided to name it after his high school moniker. The band is signed to Red Bull Records, and their first EP, Back from Earth, was released on iTunes on May 18, 2010. They have performed with Weezer and MGMT.

The band's first single, Sail debuted at #30 on the U.S. Billboard Alternative Songs chart on the chart week of February 10, 2011.

Max Richter,"Composer Max Richter was born in Germany in 1966 and grew up in the UK.  He studied composition and piano at Edinburgh University, the Royal Academy of Music and in Florence with Luciano Berio.    

Though he has a strong background in the canons of classical music, his influences were more modern composers and in particular, Iannis Xenakis whose musical compositions applied mathematical and physical laws and Philip Glass whose sound was a major influence on Richter. His influences also include rock bands The Beatles, Pink Floyd and The Clash, as well as electronic music groups Kraftwerk and Autechre.

After finishing his studies, he co-founded Piano Circus, a contemporary classical ensemble, where he stayed for ten years. With the ensemble, he commissioned and performed the works of experimental artists like Steve Reich, Arvo Pärt, Brian Eno and Julia Wolfe. Piano Circus's performances incorporated found sounds and video, allowing Richter to integrate his love of sampling and electronics. After he left, he became involved in the UK's thriving electronic scene, collaborating with The Future Sound of London and Roni Size.

He has released four solo albums: Memoryhouse (2002), Blue Notebooks (2004), Songs from Before (2006), and latest, 24 Postcards in Full Colour (2008), a collection of miniatures meant to be used as ringtones.

Recently he has scored the soundtrack to the critically acclaimed film Waltz with Bashir by Ari Folman as well as INFRA, Max's new score for The Royal Ballet, made with choreographer Wayne Macgregor and fine artist Julian Opie. He has also produced the score for the short animated film Lost and Found based upon the children's book by Oliver Jeffers. Recently, Richter's score, ""On the Nature of Daylight"", has been included in the acclaimed film Shutter Island.

Pantera,"Pantera was an extremely popular metal band from Arlington, Texas, formed in 1981. Specifically, some fans consider them power metal, groove metal, or an amalgamation of both (so called ""power groove"", a term the band devised themselves). Emerging alongside influential classic thrash metal acts such as Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax, Pantera was a key formulator of the post-thrash subgenre of heavy metal music. 

At the start of the career the style of Pantera's image and sound was heavily influenced by bands like Kiss & Van Halen. At certain stages, Pantera drew more on the popular LA glam scene. The extent to how far Pantera took the glam image is one of many disputes among fans of heavy metal and those who discredit the band's popularity to the 90s; however most of the material on the albums themselves were a contrast to typical glam metal formula. They released three albums during this stage before acquiring Razor White vocalist, Philip Anselmo from New Orleans. As soon as Anselmo joined the band the group took a noticable change in style and image with their Power Metal. The album shifted away from most of the glam image and focused mostly on the more respectable speed metal genre. This style would continue evolving for two years as Pantera drew on many more sources of influence within the metal scene.

As they began their transformation into post-thrash/groove metal they began to absorb a lot more from the underground extreme metal scene of the late 80s which included bands such as Slayer, Sepultura, Cro-Mags, and Exhorder. The latter band to this day causes much controversy and dispute between fans despite the fact that Exhorder lead singer Kyle Thomas himself stated that many of these claims are over-exaggerated and unfair for a band that ""worked a hell-of-alot harder"" than Exhorder did to get where they did.

On VH1's list of 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, Pantera ranked forty-fifth. Legendary guitarist Dimebag Darrell Abbott has won numerous awards from Metal Edge, Hit Parader, Circus, Kerrang, Guitar One, Guitar World, & Guitar For The Practicing Musician magazines for his brutal, lighting fast solos, and unmatchable grooves.

Pantera played a major role in the ""resurrection"" of American Metal in the 90's and influence can be seen to this day in a broad range of metal bands. Glam was rapidly dying out, and grunge was taking over. In February and July 1992, Pantera and Megadeth both released albums, Vulgar Display of Power, and Countdown to Extinction, the latter reaching #2 on the billboard album charts. Together, the two albums began a resurgence in American metal music. In 1994, Pantera's third major label album Far Beyond Driven debuted on the charts at number one, astonishing those in the music industry who were unaware of the band's growing legion of fans. This proved to be the band's commercial peak. In 1996 Pantera released The Great Southern Trendkill, which debuted at number four on the charts. The band toured in the summer of 1996 with White Zombie and the Deftones. In 1997, the band coheadlined the USA Ozzfest with Black Sabbath and Marilyn Manson. Soon after, the band released their first and only live album, Official Live: 101 Proof. The album debuted at number four on the billboard album charts. The band toured alongside Anthrax, Coal Chamber, and Machine Head to support the album. In 2000, the band released their final album, Reinventing The Steel. The band headlined Ozzfest 2000, then toured overseas before coming back to the USA to headline the Extreme Steel Tour, playing after the legendary Slayer, Soulfly, Static X, and Morbid Angel. 

Pantera also acquired an official drink, called Black Tooth Grin after the lyrics in the song Sweating Bullets by Megadeth.

Pantera had all of their major label albums and home videos sell to either gold or platinum status with virtually no support from MTV or radio. 

In 2002 vocalist Philip Anselmo focused on his side projects Down and Superjoint Ritual. After no communication between the Abbott brothers and Anselmo, the band officially broke up in 2003. The Abbott brothers formed Damageplan in 2003 and released the album New Found Power. On December 8th, 2004, while the band was touring for that album, deranged fan Nathan Gale shot and killed legendary guitarist Dimebag Darrell Abbott on stage, along with 3 other people.

Even though Pantera's fans are still distraught over the tragic murder of Dimebag Darrell, they have finally heard music from often talked about Rebel Meets Rebel project featuring Pantera members Dimebag Darrell, Vinnie Paul, Rex Brown and outlaw country artist David Allan Coe. A DVD entitled DIMEvision was released by Vinnie Paul's record label, Big Vin Records. Rebel Meets Rebel's self titled album was released on May 2nd, 2006, and entered the billboard charts at number 39. The DIMEvision DVD, released the same day as Rebel Meets Rebel, entered the billboard DVD charts at number one and has already sold enough copies to be certified gold. VH1 also produced a Behind The Music episode for Pantera, which resulted in many fans getting the answers they wanted regarding the final days of the band straight from the band and their friends and associates. 

Drummer Vinnie Paul can now be heard in the metal supergroup ""Hellyeah"", while Phil Anselmo and bassist Rex Brown have been heavily involved with Down since late 2006, performing several tours around the world and releasing a much anticipated third Down album which received critical praise and a single that saw heavy radio rotation. Though rumors frequently surface of a Pantera reunion with guitarist Zakk Wylde in place of Dimebag, this is nothing more than gossip with an improbable likelihood of ever happening. Any chance for a reunion between surviving members of Pantera has been delayed since Vinnie Paul and Dimebag's ex-girlfriend, Rita, remain at odds with Phil, which continues to tear a schism between Pantera fans still loyal to Philip and those who blame Phil for Pantera's demise and ultimately Dimebag's death. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Pantera"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Nas,"Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones, more commonly known as Nas (formerly Nasty Nas and Escobar), born September 14, 1973 in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York, is a prominent American MC. The son of jazz musician Olu Dara, he was raised in the infamous Queensbridge housing projects in Queensbridge, New York. According to the Nasty Songfacts, as a teenager rapper, Nasir  first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas. By the time he released his landmark solo debut album Illmatic in 1994, Jones was known as Nas. 

Illmatic was a critically acclaimed bestseller and is widely considered one of the greatest rap albums of all time. He married R&B singer Kelis in 2005, they have one son together, and she filed for divorce on the 29th of April 2009. Nas was also a part of hip hop supergroup The Firm, which released one album.

In the years following the release of Illmatic, Nas pursued a more commercial direction, which resulted in wider success but decreased artistic credibility among critics and hip-hop purists. Furthermore, Nas' increased commercial success was accompanied by stylistic changes that fostered accusations of ""selling out"". Nevertheless, the LP Stillmatic is often credited for restoring Nas' credibility among fans. Since the success of Stillmatic, Nas continues to maintain a high profile within the hip hop community, and has pursued a decidedly progressive and personal aesthetic. While Nas' current artistic direction differs greatly from his most successful work, it has ensured that he remains one of the most respected and acclaimed contemporary rappers.

1973–1992: Childhood and early career

Nas was born in Brooklyn, New York, as the elder of Olu Dara and Fannie Ann Jones's two children; his brother Jabari (nicknamed ""Jungle"" because he was born in the Congo) is the younger of the two. The family lived for a time in Brooklyn, before moving to Queensbridge, the largest public housing project in the United States. Olu Dara left the household in 1986, when Nas was 13, and Ann Jones raised her two boys on her own. Nas dropped out of school in the eighth grade and began selling drugs on the streets of New York. He educated himself, reading about African culture and civilization, the Qur'an, the Bible and the Five Percent Nation. He also studied the origin of hip hop music, taping records that played on his local radio station. As a child, Nas had wanted to be an instrumentalist (at the age of three, Nas played his father's trumpet on the step of their Brooklyn home) and also a comic book artist. Shortly after his parents separated, Nas began to write short stories as he immersed himself deeper into hip-hop culture.

By his preteen years, he had settled on pursuing a career as a rapper, and as a teenager enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Willie ""Ill Will"" Graham as his DJ. Nas first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas. Nas and Graham soon met hip-hop producer and Flushing Queens resident Large Professor, who introduced Nas to his group, Main Source. In 1991, Nas made his on-record debut with a verse on ""Live at the BBQ"", from Main Source's LP Breaking Atoms. Despite the substantial buzz for Nas in the underground scene, the rapper was rejected by major labels and was not signed to a recording deal. Nas and Graham continued to work together, but their partnership was cut short when Graham was shot and killed by a gunman in Queensbridge on May 23, 1992.

1992–1995: The recording and release of Illmatic

In mid-1992, Nas was approached by MC Serch of 3rd Bass, who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal with Columbia Records the same year. Nas made his solo debut on the single ""Halftime"" from Serch's soundtrack for the film Zebrahead. The single increased the buzz surrounding Nas and when MC Serch’s solo album is released later in the year, Nas’ standout appearance on ""Back To The Grill"" only intensified interest in his upcoming album, amid immense anticipation. Hailed as the second coming of Rakim, his rhyming skills attracted a significant amount of attention within the hip-hop community. However, many were concerned that Columbia, being a major label, would try to dilute his New York based style.

In 1994, Nas' debut album, Illmatic was finally released. Critically acclaimed and widely regarded as one of the premier rap albums ever created, Illmatic featured lyrics that portrayed stunning visual imagery and production courtesy of several producers . The album featured production from Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip (of A Tribe Called Quest) and DJ Premier, as well as guest appearances from Nas' friend AZ and his father Olu Dara on the song ""Life's a Bitch"", Illmatic was immediately hailed as a masterpiece by critics, and is still highly regarded as one of the definitive hip-hop albums of all time. Notable songs on the album included ""NY State of Mind"" (produced by Premier), ""The World Is Yours"" (produced by Pete Rock), ""One Love"" (produced by Q-Tip) and ""It Ain't Hard To Tell"" (produced by Large Professor and featuring a sample of ""Human Nature"" by Michael Jackson). However, due in part to extensive bootlegging, the record sales fell below expectations.

Following Illmatic, Nas appeared on AZ's Doe Or Die album, and collaborated with his Queensbridge-associates, Mobb Deep, on their album, The Infamous. One notable achievement during this period was Nas' verse on ""Verbal Intercourse"" on Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. After this appearance, Nas received a Source Quotable as he had the distinction of being the only non-Wu-Tang Clan member to be featured on one of the group's solo albums.

1996–1998: From It Was Written to The Firm

Columbia began to press Nas to work towards more commercial topics like the rapper The Notorious B.I.G., who had become successful by releasing street singles that still retained pop-friendly appeal. Nas traded manager MC Serch for Steve Stoute, and began preparation for his second LP, It Was Written, consciously working towards a crossover-oriented sound. It Was Written, chiefly produced by Poke and Tone of Trackmasters Entertainment, was released during the summer of 1996. Two singles, ""If I Ruled The World (Imagine That)"" (featuring Lauryn Hill of The Fugees) and ""Street Dreams"" (a remix features R. Kelly) were instant hits. These songs were promoted by big-budget music videos directed by Hype Williams, making Nas a common name among mainstream hip-hop. Other notable tracks on the album included ""The Message"" and ""I Gave You Power,"" which tells a story from the perspective of a gun. It Was Written also featured the debut of The Firm, a supergroup consisting of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown, and Cormega. The album also introduced Nas's Mafioso-inspired character ""Nas Escobar"", who lived more of a Scarface/Casino-esque lifestyle. On the other hand, Illmatic, which, while having numerous references to Tony Montana and the theatrical hit featuring Al Pacino, was more about Nas' life as a teenager in the projects, hustling and smoking marijuana.

The Firm signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment label, and began working on their debut album. Halfway through the production of the album, Cormega was fired from the group by Steve Stoute, who had unsuccessfully attempted to force Cormega to sign a deal with his management company. Cormega therefore became one of Nas' most vocal opponents, releasing a number of underground hip-hop singles dissing Nas, Stoute, and Nature, who was Cormega's replacement in The Firm. The Firm's The Album was finally released in 1997 to mixed reviews and lackluster sales and the members of the supergroup went their separate ways.

At about this time, Nas became a spokesperson for the Willie Esco urban clothing line, but had no other connection with the clothing line. He stopped promoting Willie Esco in 2000, dissatisfied with the company's operations. During the same period, Nas co-wrote and starred in Hype Williams' 1998 feature film Belly, which also featured DMX, Taral Hicks, and T-Boz of TLC among its cast.

1998–2000: I Am... to Nastradamus

In 1998, Nas began work on a double album to be entitled I Am...The Autobiography, which he intended as the middle ground between the extremes of Illmatic and It Was Written. The album was completed in early 1999, and a music video was shot for its lead single, Nas Is Like, produced by DJ Premier and featuring vocal samples from ""It Ain't Hard to Tell"". However, much of the LP was leaked in MP3 format onto the Internet, and Nas and Stoute quickly recorded enough substitute material to constitute a single-disc release.

The second single for I Am was ""Hate Me Now,"" featuring Sean ""Puffy"" Combs (now ""Diddy""), was used as an example by Nas' critics for moving towards commercial themes. Hype Williams shot an allegorical video for the single, which featured Nas and Puffy being crucified in a manner similar to Jesus; After the video was completed, Combs, a Catholic, requested his crucifixion scene be edited out of the video. However, the unedited copy of the ""Hate Me Now"" video made its way to MTV, and was premiered on April 15, 1999 on TRL. A furious Combs and his bodyguards allegedly made their way into Steve Stoute's office and assaulted him, at one point apparently hitting Stoute over the head with a champagne bottle. Stoute pressed charges, but he and Combs settled out-of-court that June.

Columbia had scheduled to release the pirated material from I Am under the title Nastradamus during the latter half of 1999, but, at the last minute, decided Nas should record an entirely new album for release. Nastradamus was therefore rushed to meet a November release date. Though critics were not kind to the album, it did result in a minor hit, the Timbaland-produced ""You Owe Me,"" featuring R&B singer Ginuwine. The only pirated track from I Am... to make it onto Nastradamus was ""Project Windows,"" featuring Ronald Isley. A number of the other bootlegged tracks later made their way onto The Lost Tapes, a collection of underground Nas songs that was released by Columbia in September 2002. The collection saw decent sales and received glowing reviews.

2000–2001: The Nas vs. Jay-Z rivalry and Stillmatic

The highly publicized rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z began as a rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z's protege, Memphis Bleek. On his debut album Coming of Age, Bleek made a song entitled ""Memphis Bleek Is"", which was similar in concept to Nas' single ""Nas is Like"". On the same album, Bleek recorded ""What You Think Of That"" featuring Bleek's mentor Jay-Z, which contains the refrain, ""I'ma ball 'til I fall/what you think of that?"". In retaliation, ""Nastradamus"", the title track from Nas' second 1999 album, featured a reference to ""What You Think Of That"". The lyrics state, ""You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that/You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat."" Memphis Bleek perceived the reference on ""Nastradamus"" as a diss, and therefore dissed Nas on the lead single for his The Understanding LP, My Mind Right"".

QB's Finest was a compilation album that featured Nas and a number of other rappers from Queensbridge, including Mobb Deep, Nature, Littles, The Bravehearts (which included Nas' younger brother Jungle among its members), and Cormega, who had briefly reconciled with Nas. The album also featured guest appearances from Queensbridge hip-hop legends Roxanne Shante, MC Shan, and Marley Marl. Shan and Marley Marl both appeared on the lead single ""Da Bridge 2001"", which was based on Shan & Marl's 1986 recording ""The Bridge"". ""Da Bridge 2001"" also featured a response from Nas to Memphis Bleek, in which Nas called out most of the Roc-A-Fella Records roster, including Bleek, Damon Dash, Beanie Sigel, and Jay-Z.

Jay-Z responded to Nas' songs with an onstage swipe during the 2001 Hot 97 Summer Jam concert in New York City, when he premiered his song ""Takeover."" Initially, the song was to only be a Mobb Deep diss, only including one line about Nas near the end. Nevertheless, Nas recorded the ""Stillmatic Freestyle,"" an underground single which sampled Rakim and Eric B.'s ""Paid in Full"" beat, and attacked Jay-Z and his Roc-A-Fella label. On his 2001 album, The Blueprint, Jay-Z rewrote ""Takeover,"" dedicating half of the song to dissing Nas, claiming that he had a ""...one hot album every ten year average"" record (referring to Illmatic) that his flow was weak, and that he had fabricated his past as a hustler.

Nas responded with ""Ether"", the track begins with gunshots and a repeated, slowed-down sample of Tupac rapping ""Fuck Jay-Z."" (taken from Tupac's ""Fuck Friends"") In ""Ether,"" Nas accuses Jay-Z of stealing (""biting"") lyrics from The Notorious B.I.G. and brown-nosing Nas and other rappers for fame. Ether was included on Nas' fifth studio album, Stillmatic, released in December 2001. Stillmatic managed to be not only a critically-acclaimed comeback album, but a commercial success as well, albeit not on the level of It Was Written and I Am...; the album debutted at #7 on the Billboard album charts and featured the singles ""Got Ur Self A..."" and ""One Mic."" In terms of commercial success, Jay's The Blueprint was certified double-platinum, while Stillmatic went platinum.

Jay-Z responded to ""Ether"" with a freestyle entitled ""Supa Ugly."" going into detail about how he had sex with Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas' daughter Destiny. Nas dismissed the track by claiming that he was no longer with Bryan during the time the affair took place. In a recent interview, however, New York radio station Hot 97 settled the battle taking votes comparing ""Ether"" and ""Supa Ugly,"" and Nas won with 58% while Jay-Z got 42% of the votes. By 2005, the two rappers had eventually ended their feud without violence or animosity. During Jay-Z's I Declare War - Power House concert, Jay-Z announced to the crowd, ""It's bigger than 'I Declare War'. Let's go, Esco!"" Nas then joined Jay-Z onstage, and the two then performed ""Dead Presidents"" together, which Jay-Z had sampled from Nas' song ""The World is Yours.""

2002–Present: From God's Son to Street's Disciple and beyond

In December 2002, Nas released the God's Son album. and its lead single, ""Made You Look"". The album debuted at #18 on the Billboard charts despite widespread internet bootlegging. Time Magazine named his album best hip-hop album of the year. Vibe Magazine gave it 4 stars and The Source gave it 4 mics. The second single, the inspirational ""I Can"", which reworked elements from Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"", became Nas' biggest hit to date during the spring and summer of 2003, garnering substantial radio airplay on urban, rhythmic, and top 40 radio stations, as well as on the MTV and VH1 music video networks. God's Son also includes several songs dedicated to memory of Nas' mother, who died of cancer in 2002. In 2003, Nas was featured on the Korn song ""Play Me"", from KoЯn's Take a Look in the Mirror LP.

Nas released his seventh studio album, the critically acclaimed double-disc Street's Disciple, on November 30, 2004. The album's first singles were ""Thief's Theme"" and ""Bridging the Gap"", which features his father Olu Dara on vocals. The album also includes ""These are Our Heroes"", which accuses prominent sports stars and actors such as Kobe Bryant, Lenny Henry, Tiger Woods, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. of neglecting their heritage and background in favour of white values. The videos for ""Bridging the Gap"" and ""Just A Moment"" received moderate airplay on MTV and BET. Although the album went platinum, its commercial profile was relatively low compared to the rapper's previous releases.

Nas was featured on Kanye West's album Late Registration on a song titled ""We Major"". West said the song was Jay-Z's favorite on the album, but West was unable to get Jay-Z to record a vocal for the final mix of the song. He also appeared on Damian Marley's song ""Road to Zion"" (which also featured newcomer The Game in the video, widening Nas' still growing universally appreciated raps) and several other songs such as ""Death Anniversary"" and ""It Wasn't You"" (featuring Lauryn Hill). In addition, Nas was most recently married to the R&B singer Kelis, who is mostly known for her work internationally, but nonetheless released great hits in the U.S. The couple wed on Jan. 8, 2005 in Atlanta, GA, after a two-year engagement.

During this time, Nas announced that his next album would be entirely self-produced and feature no other rappers, and would be titled Nasir, and later that the project would feature other producers after all and would be called Nasdaq: Dow Jones. Neither of these albums ever materialized.

At a free concert in Central Park, New York, Nas made a statement regarding the quality of 50 Cent's music. ""this is the real shit, not that 50 Cent shit!"" In response, 50 Cent included a stab at Nas by speaking negatively of his wife Kelis on his single ""Piggy Bank,"" implying that Kelis was promiscuous and calling Nas a ""sucker for love."" Nas was quoted as saying that he feels no obligation to retaliate, remarking ""[50 has] got a good five to six more albums before I can really respond to him."" Nas eventually decided to retaliate, and in July 2005 released ""Don't Body Ya Self (MC Burial)"", a song which taunts 50 Cent and his G-Unit crew, stating that 50 was ""a sucka for death if I'm a sucka for love."" However, despite all of this, Nas still claims to ""have a lot of love towards 50,"" claiming 50 didn't understand his moves when they both were together at Columbia Records.

In January 2006, Nas signed a label deal with Jay-Z's Def Jam, further emphasizing the Jay-Z/Nas truce and raising expectations for a collaboration even higher. His album due in fall of 2006 will come out in a joint deal with this imprint and Columbia Records. He recently announced to MTV News that his album is to be named, ""Hip Hop is Dead...the N,"" the N being a play on the word the ""end."" The title is supposed to reflect what some would term the current low quality of rap music. The highly anticipated album is due out in December 19th, 2006.

Musical style and Technique

Nas has long been famed for his creativity and storytelling prowess, which has earned him acclaim from both the hip-hop community and critics. In his early stages, from his first appearance on the Main Source's Breaking Atoms and throughout the recording of Illmatic, he was perhaps best known for his street-oriented topics, complex lyrical schemes (which often incorporated multi-syllabic internal rhymes), and witty phrasing and imagery. As he progressed and matured, Nas began to branch out into different subjects and developed a richer voice and slower rapping technique.

Following Illmatic's release, Nas developed a penchant for hyper-visual storytelling and topical creativity. For instance, ""Undying Love"" (featured on I Am...) is a tale of his wife's betrayal told in first person, ""Rewind"" (featured on Stillmatic) is a narrative in which a story is recited backwards, while on ""I Gave You Power"" (featured on It Was Written), Nas assumes the role of a gun who recounts brutal tales of murder and violence. Over the years Nas' style has changed significantly. In contrast to his previous work, Nas’ most recent material is distinctively socially aware and often politically inflammatory. Songs such as ""I Can"" (featured on God's Son) convey moral messages of black youth empowerment, while ""These Are Our Heroes (Coon Picnic)"" accuses several African-American celebrities of being Uncle Toms. Furthermore, controversial songs such as ""My Country"" and ""A Message to the Feds (Fuck The Police II)"" (which are featured on Stillmatic and Street's Disciple, respectively) question the conduct of the American government. Nas' views in his lyrics throughout his career have made references to Islam and the Five Percent Nation.. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Nas"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Nightwish,"Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of its debut album, Angels Fall First. In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.

Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since Angels Fall First, they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn, Wishmaster and Century Child. Their 2004 album, Once, has sold more than one million copies and was the band’s breakthrough in the United States. Their biggest US hit single, Wish I Had an Angel, received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for Once, as well as a re-recording of Sleeping Sun for the “best of” compilation album, Highest Hopes, before Turunen’s dismissal in October 2005. Her last performance with Nightwish was recorded on the live album End of an Era; after the show, the other members announced to Turunen that she was no longer a member of Nightwish.

In May 2007, Nightwish announced Anette Olzon as Turunen’s replacement. That September, the band released their sixth album, Dark Passion Play, which has sold almost 2 million copies. The album’s lead single, Amaranth, became one of Nightwish’s most successful in Europe. The supporting tour, one of the band’s largest, started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009. The band released an EP/live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), in March 2009 as a CD/DVD, and their seventh studio album, Imaginaerum, was released globally on various days in late 2011/early 2012.

On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced that they had parted ways with Olzon and would be finishing the current tour with ReVamp and former After Forever vocalist Floor Jansen. In October 2013, Nightwish made Jansen and longtime session uillean piper Troy Donockley permanent members of the band, and they are featured in the new album Endless Forms Most Beautiful, released March, 2015. The band also announced that drummer Jukka Nevalainen would be taking a temporary leave from the band due to insomnia, being replaced by drum technician Kai Hahto for the upcoming album and tour. 

1 BIOGRAPHY

1.1 Formation (1996)

After playing keyboards in several heavy metal bands in the 1990s, including Nattvindens Gråt, Perkele Börk and Darkwoods My Betrothed, Tuomas Holopainen decided to create his own project while sitting around a campfire with friends in 1996. He immediately had a clear idea of the music: experimental acoustic music he wrote himself, similar to the music usually played around campfires, but with a distinct sound and atmosphere, played on his keyboards.

He soon invited friend and schoolmate Emppu Vuorinen to play acoustic guitars, and the classical vocalist Tarja Turunen, who shared the same music teacher, Plamen Dimov. The three musicians recorded their acoustic demo Nightwish in winter 1996. The name Nightwish was derived from their first song together – the demo also included the song The Forever Moments, and an early version of Etiäinen.

1.2 Debut album and first tour (1997-1998)

In early 1997, following the release of the Nightwish demo, Jukka Nevalainen joined the band, and acoustic guitar was replaced with electric guitar. The addition of heavy metal elements to the band’s existing experimental style gave the band a different sound, forming the core of the Nightwish sound.

The band entered the studio in April 1997 to record seven songs for their second demo, Angels Fall First. In May 1997, the demo made its way to the Finnish record label Spinefarm Records, who wanted to release it as the band’s debut album of the same name. The label signed Nightwish to a two album deal, and the band returned to the studio to record four songs more to accompany the tracks of the demo. The full-length album Angels Fall First was released in November 1997 and reached number 31 on the Finnish album charts, with the single The Carpenter reaching number 3 on the Finnish singles chart. The The Carpenter single was released as a split with label mates Children of Bodom and Thy Serpent; the album is also one of the two releases which features Holopainen’s vocals, appearing on four of the album’s eleven tracks alongside Turunen’s. 

After encountering a mixed critical reception in their first year of existence, the band made their live debut in their hometown Kitee in December 1997. Since they were missing a bass player, Samppa Hirvonen joined them as a sessional live member. Marianna Pellinen was also a sessional live member as an additional keyboard player and a backing vocalist for Turunen. There were plans to make Hirvonen a permanent member, but he joined the army as part of Finnish army conscription just as they began recording Oceanborn, so they asked Sami Vänskä to join instead, since Tuomas knew him from the band Nattvindens Gråt. During the winter of 1997 and 1998, the band performed only seven times, because Turunen was finishing her schooling, and Nevalainen and Holopainen were serving their obligatory Finnish military service. Nightwish returned to the studio in August 1998 as a five-piece to record their follow-up album for Spinefarm Records.

1.3 International success (1998-2000)

In October 7, 1998, Nightwish released their second full-length album, Oceanborn, in Finland only. Adopting a more technical and progressive sound than Angels Fall First, Oceanborn saw the band abandon much of the ambient and folk elements present on their debut release, with the exception of the song Moondance. In contrast to the female vocals of Turunen, the album also featured guest growling vocals by Tapio Wilska (ex-Finntroll), since Tuomas did not want to sing again. Wilska is also a former member of Nattvindens Gråt.

Oceanborn was better received than the previous album, with AllMusic writing that the album »as a whole works great«, with songs that are »very strong«. Oceanborn was an instant success in Finland, reaching number 5 on the Finnish album charts. The album’s first single, Sacrament of Wilderness, hit number 1 on the Finnish singles charts, where it stayed for several weeks. The album’s release was initially limited to Finland, but because of the success of Sacrament of Wilderness, Spinefarm released Oceanborn internationally in the spring of 1999. In May 1999, Nightwish recorded the single Sleeping Sun (Four Ballads of the Eclipse), and in one month the single sold 15 000 copies in Germany alone. Following the band’s first international success, Nightwish was added as the opening band for Rage’s 1999 European tour. Both the album Oceanborn and the singles Sacrament of Wilderness and Walking in the Air were certified gold in Finland in August 1999.

While in the studio in early 2000 working on their third album, Nightwish was accepted in the Finnish Eurovision Song Contest tryouts with the song Sleepwalker. Despite winning the public vote, Nightwish eventually finished in second place, with the jury choosing local gospel singer Nina Åström to represent Finland.

In May 19, 2000, Nightwish released their third studio album, Wishmaster. This debuted at No. 1 on the Finnish album charts, and was certified gold in Finland after three weeks at number one. Critical response to the album was mixed, with Allmusic citing the album as repetitive, and saying »as a whole album, it can be a little annoying, even frustrating«. However, German magazine Rock Hard declared Wishmaster Album of the Month, despite competing against long-awaited May releases from Iron Maiden and Bon Jovi. Following the release of Wishmaster, Nightwish embarked on their first world tour, playing dates in South America, Mexico, Canada, and the first headlining European tour with Sinergy and Eternal Tears of Sorrow. In the summer, the band returned to Europe, appearing at the Wacken Open Air festival and the Biebop Metal Fest.

1.4 New bassist and symphonic elements (2001-2003)

In 2001, Nightwish recorded a cover of Gary Moore’s Over the Hills and Far Away together with two new songs (10th Man Down, unreleased from Oceanborn sessions, and Away, unreleased from Wishmaster sessions) and a remake of Astral Romance (from the Angels Fall First album) with Tony Kakko (Sonata Arctica) singing Tuomas’ part. This new material was released as their first (and until 2009 the only) EP, Over the Hills and Far Away.

The record also included guest performances by Tapio Wilska once again on 10th Man Down. Nightwish’s version of Over the Hills and Far Away was well received by fans, becoming a frequent part of the band’s live performances, but the other songs never had a great break-through and have not been re-released, with the exception of a live performance of 10th Man Down on End of Innocence with Marco Hietala (current bass player and male vocalist). In the same year, they also released (as VHS, DVD and CD) their first live album, From Wishes to Eternity, recorded during a show in Tampere, Finland, on December 29, 2000.

Soon after the release of Over the Hills and Far Away, Nightwish met what has been described as one of their hardest points as a band. The issues centered on the bassist, Sami Vänskä, who had started misbehaving towards the band, according to Holopainen, by missing appointments and failing to take gigs as seriously as the other members did. After the band discussed of his behavior with Vänskä several times, without getting any change, everyone simply stopped caring and tensions grew. Meanwhile, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen had started complaining about his role in the band, feeling like »a hired gun who would only do what he’s asked to«. According to their music teacher, Plamen Dimov, he and Holopainen have totally different characters, and thus difficulties were expected to arise. But Vuorinen was told to stay cool and »bite the bullet«, and the problem was never addressed again.

Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started thinking about breaking Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him that he did not think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish’'s last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He told them he might produce another album, but he’d never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band’s message board. 

Straight after the last gig, Holopainen went on a week-long hiking trip to Lapland with Tony Kakko. During the hiking trip, they talked about the band and Holopainen decided he could not break up Nightwish that easily. When he returned from Lapland he immediately received a phone call from Ewo Pohjola, CEO of Spinefarm, offering himself to become their manager and help him straighten things up, and Holopainen agreed.

In order to continue with Nightwish, Holopainen decided some changes were in order. Beside choosing Ewo as their new manager, he also asked Vänskä to leave the band. Marco Hietala (Tarot) was asked to replace Vänskä, effectively leaving his previous band Sinergy. As well as playing bass guitar, Hietala would also perform male vocals. Holopainen has since said publicly that he and Vänskä still keep in touch, contrary to rumours saying that they have not met since. However, they are not interested in making another project together.

In 2002, Nightwish released Century Child, along with the singles Ever Dream and Bless the Child. The main difference from previous albums is the use of a live Finnish orchestra on the tracks Bless the Child, Ever Dream, Feel For You and The Beauty of the Beast. An enduring favorite of fans, though, is the band’s version of The Phantom of the Opera, from the famous musical of the same name by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. The song was repeatedly played on concerts until vocalist Tarja Turunen was replaced with Anette Olzon, whereupon the band announced that they would never play the song live again.

Century Child was certified gold two hours after its release, and platinum two weeks afterwards. It set a record on the Finnish album charts as well: Never before had a first place album been so distant from the second place. After the Bless the Child music video, a second one was recorded, without any single support. The chosen track was End of All Hope. The clip contains pieces from the Finnish movie Kohtalon kirja (English: The Book of Fate).

In 2003, Nightwish released their second DVD, the documentary End of Innocence. It tells the story of the band in Holopainen, Nevalainen and Tapio Wilska’s words for two hours. The documentary also features bits of live concerts, exclusive footage, etc. Vocalist Tarja Turunen also got married during the summer of 2003, and there were rumours that the band was about to be dissolved. These rumours were, at the time, proven to be false, as the band continued to play concerts for another year and released another album. Tarja’s marriage later played a part in her dismissal from the band in the autumn of 2005.

1.5 Chart-topping success of Once (2004)

A new album, Once, was released on June 7, 2004, along with the first single, Nemo (Latin: “No one”), from that album. The single topped the charts in Finland and Hungary, and reached the charts in six additional countries. Nemo remains the band’s most successful single release to date.

Once utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album. Unlike Century Child, Nightwish decided to look for an orchestra outside of Finland this time, choosing the London Philharmonic Orchestra. It is also their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, Kuolema tekee taiteilijan (Finnish: “Death Makes an Artist”). Once has sold triple platinum in Finland, platinum in Germany and Gold in six other countries, it also reached No. 1 in the Greek, Norwegian and German album charts, and charted the Top Ten in France, Hungary and Sweden. The following singles were: Wish I Had an Angel (featured on the soundtrack of the film Alone in the Dark), Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan (released only in Finland and Japan) and The Siren. Besides the commercial success, Once was also well received by critics, with many positive reviewers drawing comparisons with Oceanborn.

The success of the album allowed them to perform Once Upon a Tour, taking them to play in many countries the band had never visited before. Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, held in Helsinki, highlighting the acclaim the band had gained. A “best of” album, Highest Hopes, was released in September 2005. The compilation also featured a live cover High Hopes]/track] (from the Pink Floyd album The Division Bell). Besides High Hopes, a remake of Sleeping Sun (from Oceanborn[(album]) was included on the album and released as a single. A video for the remake was shot, featuring a medieval battle, and can be found on the German release of the single and as a separate DVD released by Spinefarm.

1.6 Turunen's dismissal (2005)

The four other members of Nightwish had decided that it was best to continue Nightwish without Turunen. After a concert in the Hartwall Areena (Helsinki) on October 21, 2005, recorded for the live album End of an Era (released June 2006), they expressed their decision through an open letter which was given to Turunen by Holopainen, and afterwards posted on the band’s website. It was written by Holopainen and signed by all four band members. The main justification given in the letter for Turunen’s dismissal was that the band felt that both her husband Marcelo Cabuli (an Argentine businessman) and commercial interests had changed her attitude towards the band.

Turunen responded to the incident twice, during press conferences in Finland and Germany, saying that her dismissal came entirely as a shock to her, given that she had not been notified before the letter was given to her. She felt that the personal attacks on her husband were unwarranted, and that playing the issue out in public was »senselessly cruel«. She expressed these feelings through her own open letter, which was published on her personal website, and through various TV, magazine, and newspaper interviews.

1.7 Hiatus and new lead singer (2006-2009)

In order to find a replacement for Turunen as the female vocalist of the band, on March 17, 2006 the band allowed vocalists interested for the position to send in demo tapes as an audition for the spot. During this time, speculation began to emerge about who would eventually be chosen, and the band stated on their website that fans should not believe any source other than the band itself for information regarding the new vocalist. In the end, the 35-year-old Alyson Avenue’s ex-lead singer, Anette Olzon, from Sweden, was chosen.

In September 2006, the band entered the studio to record their sixth studio album, Dark Passion Play. In May, next year, Anette Olzon was announced to replace Turunen. Holopainen has said in interviews that he did not wish to reveal her identity until new material was available because he did not want fans judging her by nothing more than a picture, or past work.

The day after this revealing, May 25, 2007, charity single Eva was released for download only as the first offering from the new album, and the first featuring Olzon. It was originally scheduled for release on May 30, but the date was changed because of a leak on a British music download site. On June 13, Nightwish revealed the title and artwork for the new album on their official website, as well as the name and cover of the second single , Amaranth; it was released in Finland on August 22 and included a bonus track entitled  While Your Lips Are Still Red  written by Tuomas as the main theme track for the upcoming Finnish feature film Lieksa!. The single achieved gold status in Finland after less than two days in stores.

Dark Passion Play was released around Europe in the last week of September, 2007, in the UK on October 1, and the United States on October 2. It was awarded double platinum in Finland the second day after its release and took the number one position on the charts of Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Hungary and Croatia and got in top 100 in other 16 countries, including the United States.

On this album, male vocalist Marco Hietala has more freedom in the use of his voice: he sings back up in the songs Cadence of Her Last Breath and Sahara, lead vocals in the songs The Islande, Master Passion Greed and While Your Lips Are Still Red, and chorus in the songs Bye Bye Beautiful and 7 Days to the Wolves. He also sings one part in The Poet and the Pendulum, besides singing back up in the chorus. Before the band found the new singer and the album was recorded, Marco sang on all the demo versions. Holopainen also sang on the demo versions of Bye Bye Beautiful and Master Passion Greed but these songs have never been released.[3]

On September 22, 2007, the band hosted a secret concert at Rock Café in Tallinn, Estonia, disguising itself as a Nightwish cover band called Nachtwasser. Their first official concert with Olzon was in Tel Aviv, Israel, on October 6, 2007. The Dark Passion Play tour thus started, visiting the United States, Canada, most of Europe, Asia, and Australia. 

The third single of the album was Erämaan viimeinen, a previously unreleased vocal version of the instrumental Last of the Wilds. It was released in Finland only on December 5, 2007. On this song, Jonsu of the Finnish pop and rock band Indica performs the Finnish vocals. Bye Bye Beautiful, the fourth single, was released on February 15, 2008, and concerns the 2005 dismissal of Turunen, as does one other song on the album, Master Passion Greed. The single includes yet another bonus track, Escapist, which is also included on the Japanese version of Dark Passion Play. Within a week after the release, the fifth single was announced to be The Islander. It was released over a month after the release of its music video, shot in late 2007 in Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland.

The Dark Passion Play tour turned out to be Nightwish’s longest tour yet, lasting from the fall of 2007 to September 2009 when it ended with a concert in Hartwall Arena – the band’s second concert there – with the band Apocalyptica.

On March 6, 2009,Nightwish released a new live EP entitled Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places). The eight live tracks were recorded during the Dark Passion Play World Tour in 2007–2008, and the album also includes one b-side from the Bye Bye Beautiful single, one b-side from the Amaranth single, a previously unreleased demo version of Cadence of Her Last Breath, and a bonus-DVD with three music videos as well as a 37 minute documentary called Back in the Day is Now.

1.8 Imaginaerum, Olzon’s dismissal (2009-2012)

In the June 2009 edition of the Finnish magazine Soundi, Holopainen stated that he had started work on a new Nightwish album. In October 2009, rumors about the new album’s name were going around with the title Wind Embraced, but lead vocalist Anette Olzon listed the rumors as »not true« and said that the songs for the new album had not yet been completed apart from 3 songs written before May 2009. Holopainen said in a 2010 interview that »[…]I can’t reveal to you anymore but there is going to be a big twist so to say, on the next album.« In an interview with uillean piper Troy Donockley (who recorded with the band on Dark Passion Play), when asked about his involvement in the new album, he stated »Oh yes, I will be playing on the next album and from what Tuomas has told me, it is going to be something extraordinary…«

On February 1, 2010, Olzon stated on her blog that Holopainen had nine songs ready for the new album. She also stated that the band will be meeting in the summer to make a demo, and fans should not expect anything any earlier than fall of 2011. In April, 2010, Holopainen revealed on the Nightwish homepage that he had finished writing the songs, and on June 2, it was announced that he had finished recording the pre-production demo.

The band announced in late 2010 that more information of the album’s actual content would be released in late January, but on February 1, the official website bore a statement written by Holopainen that because of the schedule changes he can’t yet give away as much details as he would have wanted, but more information will be out after a couple of months. He added, however, that »it still is the Burton-Gaiman-Dalí-amusement-park we are about to enter«; In the same statement it was revealed that the album will be a theme album and »mood changes seem to be more present than ever before«, and the orchestration demos he had received from Pip Williams were described as »beautiful, twisted, tribal and cinematic stuff«. In the Finnish version of the statement, it was also revealed that a few songs will not get any orchestrations at all, differing from their latest album on which all songs had the background orchestra.

Announcements continued throughout 2011. On February 10, Nightwish announced on their website that the new album title would be Imaginaerum. They also declared that the band had been preparing a movie based on the album, which would be released in 2012 and directed by Stobe Harju, who previously directed the music video for The Islander. On August 22, 2011, it was announced on their official website that the album of Imaginaerum would be released at the end of the year. On August 31, Nightwish announced on their website their decision to change Imaginarium title to Imaginaerum »In order to avoid mix-ups with various things named IMAGINARIUM«. Then on September 2, Nightwish announced on their website that the new single called Storytime will be released on Friday, November 11 and on September 9, Nightwish revealed the cover and tracklist.

On January 11, 2012, Nightwish announced on their website that the second single The Crow, the Owl and the Dove would be released on February 29. Roadrunner Records announced that Nightwish would be releasing a 10″ LP titled Trials of Imaginaerum in conjunction with Record Store Day (April 21, 2012). The 10″ LP is a two sided picture disk, which contains four early demos of Storytime, The Crow, The Owl and The Dove, I Want My Tears Back and Slow, Love, Slow.

On October 1 2012, Nightwish announced via their Facebook page that they were parting ways with Olzon. According to the press statement, »it has become increasingly obvious that the direction and the needs of the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover«. This announcement came days after Olzon fell ill and was unable to perform; Nightwish used replacement singers from the opening band, Kamelot, and Olzon later expressed her disappointment, saying »I was never asked if it was OK that they used Elize and Alissa in the show [Friday] night […] I don’t think it’s a good decision they made and I’m sorry for those of you who came to see the whole band but got something else. But I was very ill and this decision wasn’t mine.« According to the statement, Floor Jansen (ex-After Forever, ReVamp) will sing for the remainder of the Imaginaerum World Tour.

On January 11, 2013, Olzon announced on her official blog that she was pregnant with her third child, due in spring 2013. This was a contributing factor to her being dismissed. The band then released a statement on their website declaring that the reason Olzon gave for her dismissal and other statements she made were untrue and that Olzon herself had agreed to help find a replacement while she was on maternity leave. Later on, Olzon gave several interviews in which she told that she never agreed with a replacement, even when she was pregnant, and proposed to the band to postpone the tour, culminating on her firing. She also added that she was against Jansen joining the band in her period of maternity, mainly because the difference of their vocal styles.

1.9 Endless Forms Most Beautiful, arrival of Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley (2013-present)

In an interview with Metal Hammer in November 2012, Tuomas Holopainen stated that they already had a rehearsal place booked from July 2014 to September 2014, but before they began rehearsing the band members would be taking a break from Nightwish for several months.

On 9 October, 2013, Nightwish announced Dutch singer Floor Jansen as the permanent replacement for Olzon. Troy Donockley has also been announced as a full-time member, making the band a sextet for the first time. According to the band’s webpage, the band would enter the studio in 2014 to record their eighth full-length album for a 2015 release. This album was set to contain Nightwish’s longest song to date.

At the end of November, the band released the live album Showtime, Storytime. Despite the recording happening when they were only tour members, it is the first Nightwish release to feature Jansen, and to have her and Donockley credited as band members. The album also carries a documentary containing the behind-the-scenes of Jansen’s first days in the band and the process of replacing Olzon.

In May, 2014, Tuomas updated his official website, stating that he and producer Tero »TeeCee« Kinnunen have been recording 12 demos (and possibly 3 bonus tracks) for the new album in Hattula, Finland. The band expected to start rehearsing in July in Eno, Finland, with the recording finished on January 2015, and the album released in Spring that year, »If everything goes as scheduled«. Commenting on the music, Tuomas said: »It’s still too early to analyze the material more closely, but the album will once again explore all the ends of the spectrum, bringing the very best out of the newcomers Floor and Troy. And stealthily the album ended up having a theme running through it.«

On August 6, the band announced that founding member and drummer Jukka Nevalainen would not be part of the upcoming album due to his very difficult insomnia. Kai Hahto (Wintersun) would be taking his place in the album and the upcoming tour.

Evolutionary biologist and author Richard Dawkins will be a guest star on the album, with Holopainen stating that he had »been so enthusiastic about this kind of literature for the past few months, and will be for the upcoming months, that it’s going to come out somehow.«

In November, the band filmed a music video for Élan, one of the tracks of the album. On December 8, the band announced that it would be the first single from the album, which would be released on February 13, 2015.

Alabama Shakes,"Alabama Shakes is an American rock band formed in Athens, Alabama, United States in 2009. The group consists of lead singer Brittany Howard, guitarist Heath Fogg, bassist Zac Cockrell, and drummer Steve Johnson.

Here is some background information on Alabama Shakes from the Hold On Songfacts: The R&B-inspired Rock band Alabama Shakes originated when lead singer/guitarist Brittany Howard approached bassist Zac Cockrell during a high school psychology class in Athens, Alabama and the pair began meeting after school to write songs. Howard and Cockrell then approached Punk-Rock drummer Steve Johnson, who was working at a local music store, to join the band. The trio recorded some of their songs in a studio in Decatur, Alabama and subsequently recruited guitarist Heath Fogg on his return to Athens from college in Tuscaloosa.

The Fray,"From the sleepy sprawl of America's 'Mile-High City', Denver, Colorado, United States, comes The Fray, a foursome whose melodic piano rock songs and soaring vocals resonate with sprawling tapestries and tales of hopefulness and heartache. Formed in 2002 by Isaac Slade (vocals, piano) and Joe King (guitar, vocals), The Fray earned a loyal grassroots following through impressive area gigs and the support of local radio, which led a listener-driven campaign to get the band a record contract.

With strong word-of-mouth, the band won ""Best New Band"" honors from Denver's Westword Magazine and garnered substantial airplay on two of Denver's top rock stations. Specifically, he demo version of ""Over My Head (Cable Car)"" became KTCL's top 30 most played song of 2004 in just four months. The band signed to Epic Records in 2004 and released their debut album, titled 'How To Save A Life', in September 2005.

The band's roots come from when Joe King's band, Fancy's show box, and Isaac Slade's band, Ember, broke up. ""Three years ago, I thought I wanted to start a real estate company,"" laughs co-founder King. A serendipitous encounter with former schoolmate Slade at a local music store began an impromptu jam session that began an impromptu songwriting session that began The Fray. It wasn't your usual rock n' roll lineup - vocals, guitar and piano - but it worked. The uplifting, melody-driven songs were catchy enough to attract two former band-mates of Slade's - drummer Ben Wysocki and guitarist Dave Welsh. ""Ben and I were basically a package deal at the time,"" explains Welsh. ""Ben joined first, but I think he felt lonely without me.""

It didn't hurt that the boys were all consummate musicians. A pianist from an early age, King competed in the local recital circuit before dropping piano altogether and picking up the guitar in junior high. ""The coolest guys in my eighth grade class all played guitar,"" confides King. ""I wanted to fit in."" Slade began singing when he was eight, but temporary voice problems led him to discover the piano at age 11. After regaining his vocal abilities a year later, he continued studying piano and learned guitar in high school. ""I wrote my first song at 16,"" explains Slade, ""which is when I first picked up the guitar."" Wysocki began taking drum lessons in the sixth grade, but only after having endured piano lessons at his parents' request. Welsh grew up in a musical household, and struggled with piano and saxophone before settling on guitar at age 12.

The lineup secure, all the band needed was a name. Jokes about the boys' tendency to battle it out over song composition led to the suggestion of ""The Fray,"" and the name stuck. So did The Fray's style - a sophisticated, emotional blend of tinkling pianos, acoustic and electric guitars, and gently insistent rhythms that serves as an ideal backdrop for Slade's pitch-perfect, slurred yet achingly beautiful vocals. The band's first single, ""Over My Head (Cable Car)"", echoes the poignant lyricism of Counting Crows and the melodic intensity of U2. The title track, ""How To Save A Life"", is a heartbreaking meditation on salvation inspired by Slade's experience as a mentor to a crack-addicted teen. Both songs employ an epic sweep, speeding up and slowing down so effortlessly that the listener can't help but become emotionally involved by the time the crescendo hits.

Considering the quality of songwriting involved, the band's rise to local prominence within the span of a year doesn't seem so implausible. In January of 2004 The Fray were no-namers trying to find gigs. By December, they were getting radio pick-up and playing sold-out shows at 500-capacity venues. With a series of U.S. tour dates supporting legendary geek rockers Weezer in July 2005, The Fray made even more new fans by the time ""How To Save A Life"" dropped in September 2005.

In a recent episode of ""Scrubs"" called ""My Lunch"", the song ""How To Save A Life"" featured in the final scene where things start going wrong for Dr. Cox. 

The song ""How To Save A Life"" speaks about Isaac Slade's story about helping  a trouble teen that was exposed to drugs. ""Over My Head (Cable Car)"", originally just called ""Cable Car"", speaks about the conflict between Isaac Slade and older brother/ former band mate Caleb. They fired Caleb from the band and thus their brotherly relationship began to stir, and Over My Head was written. ""Look After You"" was written for Isaac Slade's wife. ""Little House"" was written about a person who cut themselves.

The band's second studio album, a self-titled work, was released on February 3, 2009. Receiving considerable commercial success, 'The Fray' spawned off the popular single ""You Found Me"", a powerful, emotional track that appealed to many fans.

""Heartbeat,"" the first single from The Fray's third album 'Scars and Stories' was  premiered by the band while opening for U2 on their U2 360° Tour in May 2011. It was released for airplay on October 8, 2011, and made available for download October 11, 2011. The song was inspired by Slade's experiences whilst traveling in Africa and also achieved notable success. 'Scars and Stories' itself was released on February 7, 2012. (The Heartbeat Songfacts).

Young Thug,"Jeffery Williams, better known by his stage name Young Thug, and was briefly known as ""Jeffery"", is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia who is signed to Gucci Mane's 1017 Brick Squad Records, Asylum Records and Atlantic Records. Thug grew to prominence in 2013 after releasing his mixtape 1017 Thug to positive critical reception. He has collaborated with artists such as Gucci Mane, Young Scooter, Rich Homie Quan and Waka Flocka Flame.

Thug was born amongst the masses eliminating any doubt that he wouldn’t be special. The second youngest child of 11 children developed a skill for standing out amongst many, early. Young Thug moved to Jonesboro, an impoverished suburb of Georgia where his lifestyle was engrossed by the crime, drug addiction and violence that surrounded him. It was there that he developed an insatiable appetite to succeed his current situation. After discovering and acknowledging his talent and creativity for music in  2010, Thug started a new hustle that would soon mature as one of the most promising music careers in the South. 

Eyeballing the throne of Hip hop royalty, Young Thug began to create a sound and style that would inevitably place him on top. Young Thug’s catchy verses and raw lyrical talent distinguished noise from art, clearly being the latter his creations are the best that remain of Southern hip hop. He is the embodiment of the evolution of Southern hip-hop. Young Thug is the representative for a generation that doesn't see hip-hop as a hobby but a lifestyle. Keeping true to himself, his art, and his home Young Thug will stand alone as the one true savior of the Southern movement. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Thug"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Local Natives,"Local Natives (formerly cavil at rest) is an indie rock band based in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA, United States.
After the three founding members originally met in high school, a bassist and a drummer were found, and they all moved to a house in Silver Lake in 2008 to record their album. Their debut album as Local Natives, ""Gorilla Manor"", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band's sound has been described as ""afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies"". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.

Utilizing lots of vocal harmonies and drifting, dreamlike melodies, Local Natives have an intricate sound based around the delicate interconnectedness of all of their parts. This gives the band a sound that is able to be orchestral while still feeling understated, evoking the carefully assembled pop of Grizzly Bear. Their debut, Gorilla Manor, arrived in 2009 through U.K. label Infectious Records (with a domestic release coming by way of Frenchkiss in 2010). In 2011, Andy Hamm left Local Natives, leaving them to continue on as a quartet. In 2013, the band returned with its sophomore album, Hummingbird, featuring the single ""Breakers"".

Explosions in the Sky,"Explosions In The Sky is an American instrumental post-rock band, which formed in Austin, Texas in 1999. Munaf Rayani, Mark Smith, and Michael James had just moved to Austin from Midland, Texas, and drummer Chris Hrasky had just moved to Austin from Rockford, Illinois.

The band quickly gained a reputation for their live shows even amongst other established local bands such as Lift To Experience.  They also garnered a small amount of media attention as a result of their second album Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever, due to rumors linking it to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks - The album was released in late August 2001, with liner notes containing a picture of an airplane and the text ""This Plane Will Crash Tomorrow"". 

""The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place"" is their third full-length album (counting ""How Strange, Innocence"" as their debut, see below). It shows the band has developed their characteristic sound to its full potential and the album has been critically acclaimed.

Friday Night Lights, the football movie based on the book of the same name, featured a soundtrack consisting mostly of songs by Explosions in the Sky, both original (as found on the Friday Night Lights soundtrack ) and from earlier releases. They are also frequently played in the TV-series sharing the name.

21: The Rescue, an experimental work for which the band sat down for eight days creating a song for each.  The clapping and finger snapping on ""Day Eight"" is a good example of a harmonic restructuring of their old sound. 

How Strange, Innocence, the band's debut album, was finally remastered and re-released, making it accessible to a much larger audience.  The first pressing consisted of only 300 CD-Rs that the band would later regret handing out as they felt the work to be naive, musically simple and not up to their standards.  They have since learned to love, as well as hate, their debut as a showcase of their emotional range and emerging talent. 

On 20 Feb 2007, the band released, 'All Of A Sudden, I Miss Everyone'. The band's latest album ""Take Care, Take Care, Take Care"" was released in April 2011.

Kiss,"There are three groups of artists with this name:

1) KISS, American rock band
2) Kiss, Korean pop trio → 키스 or K.I.S.S.
3) Kiss, Taiwanese girl group

KISS is an American hard rock band that formed in New York City, USA in 1973. The group has performed and recorded continuously since their formation. KISS has sold over 100 million albums worldwide and has been awarded 45 gold albums to date, and has certified sales of 19 million records in the U.S. Their latest album is 2012's 'Monster'.

Easily identified by their trademark face paint (registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office) and stage costumes, KISS quickly rose to prominence on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire-breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars and pyrotechnics. Inspired by energetic shock rock artists such as Alice Cooper and cult works of American horror and science fiction, they had their biggest commercial success in the 70s, influencing many later arena rock and heavy metal artists. They continue to play to a massive fan-base known as the 'Kiss Army'.

The original lineup of Gene Simmons (bass and vocals), Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar and vocals), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals) and Peter Criss (drums and vocals) became the most successful and identifiable in the band's history, and released a series of gold and platinum albums throughout the 1970s. Due to substance abuse problems and creative differences, both Peter Criss and Ace Frehley were out of the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes had also waned considerably by that point.

In 1983, KISS abandoned their makeup and enjoyed a commercial resurgence throughout the mid-to-late 1980s. They began to fall out of favor once again by the early 1990s, however. Buoyed by a wave of KISS nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting ""KISS Alive Worldwide"" tour was the top-grossing act of 1996.

Criss and Frehley have since left KISS, and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.

Early years and struggles (1972-75)

KISS traces its roots to Wicked Lester, a New York-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Simmons (born Chaim Witz in Haifa, Israel on August 25, 1949) and Stanley (born Stanley Harvey Eisen in Queens, New York City on January 20, 1952) fired the other members of Wicked Lester in 1972 after Epic Records rejected an album recorded by the group.

In late 1972, Simmons spotted an ad in Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a drummer ""willing to do anything."" Criss (born Peter Criscuola on December 20, 1945 in Brooklyn, New York City) auditioned for and joined Wicked Lester, now a trio. In January 1973 the group added lead guitarist Paul ""Ace"" Frehley (born April 27, 1951 in the Bronx, New York City) after being extremely impressed with his audition. That month, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became KISS.

Stanley is credited with coming up with the name and the logo, while Frehley came up with the idea of making the ""SS"" look like lightning bolts, because he said that it ""looked cool."" The letters happened to look similar to the insignia of the Nazi SS, or Waffen-SS, a symbol that is now illegal to display in Germany. Therefore, in Germany, all of the band's album covers and merchandise used a modified version of the logo, in which the ""SS"" looks like a backwards ""ZZ.""

The first KISS performance was on January 30, 1973, for an audience of three at the Popcorn Club (renamed Coventry shortly afterward) in Queens. In June of that year, the band recorded a five-song demo tape with producer Eddie Kramer. After a handful of showcase concerts in the summer of 1973, former TV director Bill Aucoin offered to become the band’s manager in mid-October. KISS agreed, with the condition that Aucoin get them signed to a recording contract within two weeks. On November 1, 1973, KISS became the first act signed to former teen pop singer and Buddha Records executive Neil Bogart's new label, Emerald City Records (which was shortly afterward renamed Casablanca Records).

The band entered Bell Sound Studios in New York City on October 10, 1973 to begin recording their first album. On December 31 the band had their official industry premier at the Academy of Music in New York City, opening for Blue Öyster Cult. It was at this concert that Simmons accidentally set his hair (which was coated in hairspray) ablaze while performing his inaugural fire-breathing stunt.

KISS's first major tour started on February 5, 1974 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, at the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium. The band’s self-titled debut album, KISS, was released on February 18. Casablanca and KISS promoted the album heavily throughout the spring and summer of 1974. On February 19, the band performed ""Nothin' to Lose,"" ""Firehouse"" and ""Black Diamond"" for what would become their first national television appearance, on ABC's Dick Clark's In Concert (aired March 29).

On April 29, the band performed ""Firehouse"" on The Mike Douglas Show. This broadcast included Simmons's first televised interview, a conversation with Douglas in which Simmons declared himself ""evil incarnate,"" eliciting titters from an uncomfortable and largely confused studio audience. The presence of the costumed, made-up Simmons on Douglas's mid-afternoon, conservative talk show caused a palpable sense of tension in both the host and the audience, which Simmons seemed to enjoy as he intentionally exacerbated it by frequent exhibitions of tongue-flashing. This tension was then punctured by a spontaneous humorous exchange between Simmons and another of the show's guests, comedienne Totie Fields, which caused Simmons to break character and laugh.

The band flew to Los Angeles in August to begin recording their second album, Hotter Than Hell, which was released in on October 22, 1974. The only single, ""Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll,"" failed to chart and the album stalled at #100.

With Hotter Than Hell quickly dropping off the charts, KISS was pulled from their tour to quickly record a new album. Casablanca Records head Neil Bogart stepped in to produce the next album, trading in the murky, distorted sound of Hotter Than Hell for a cleaner and slightly poppier sound. Dressed To Kill, released on March 19, 1975, fared slightly better commercially than Hotter Than Hell. It also contained what would later become the band's trademark song, ""Rock and Roll All Nite.""

Although KISS albums had not proven to be big sellers, the band was quickly gaining a reputation as a top-flight live act. KISS concerts featured things such as Simmons spitting ""blood"" (primarily yogurt and food coloring) or ""breathing fire"" (spitting flammable liquid at a torch); Frehley soloing as his guitar burst into flames (light and smoke bombs placed inside the guitar); Criss's elevating drum riser that emitted sparks; Stanley's Townshend-style guitar smashing; and pyrotechnics throughout the show.

By late 1975, Casablanca was nearly bankrupt and KISS was in danger of losing their record contract. Both parties desperately needed a commercial breakthrough if they were to survive. That breakthrough came in an unlikely form - a double live album.

Success (1975-78)

KISS attempted to express the excitement felt at their live shows (which their studio albums had so far failed to do), with their next album. Released on September 10, 1975, Alive!, would go on to achieve quadruple platinum status, and spawned KISS's first top 40 single, a live version of ""Rock And Roll All Nite."" It was the first version of ""Rock and Roll All Nite"" with a guitar solo, and this recording has come to represent the definitive version of the song; supplanting the studio original.

The success of Alive! not only brought KISS the breakthrough they had been seeking, but arguably saved Casablanca. Following this success, KISS partnered with producer Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked with Alice Cooper. The result was Destroyer (released March 15, 1976), KISS's most musically ambitious studio album to date. While the album sold well initially, it quickly dropped down the charts. Only when the power ballad ""Beth"" was released as a single did the album's fortunes rebound. ""Beth"" was a #7 hit for the band, and its success revived album and ticket sales for KISS.

Destroyer, with its rather intricate production, was a departure from the rawer sound of the first three studio albums. Despite this, the album is now considered by many fans to be the band's finest, and many of the songs from Destroyer remain KISS concert staples to this day.

In October 1976, KISS made an appearance on the The Paul Lynde Halloween Special, lip-synching ""Detroit Rock City,"" ""Beth"" and ""King of the Night Time World."" For many teenagers, this was their first exposure to KISS's dramatic appearance. The show was co-produced by KISS manager Bill Aucoin. In addition to the three songs, KISS was the subject of a brief comedic ""interview"" conducted by Paul Lynde himself. This included Lynde noting, when hearing the member's names, ""Oh, I love a good religious group.""

A 1977 Gallup poll named KISS the most popular band in America. In Japan, KISS broke attendance records previously held by the Beatles. KISS merchandise became a huge source of income for the group. Some of the products released were two comic books released by Marvel, pinball machines, Mego dolls, ""KISS Your Face Makeup"" kits, Halloween masks, board games and many other pieces of memorabilia. Membership in the KISS Army, the band's fan club, was in the six figures. As the dominant music format of the time, vinyl album releases by the band were considered collectors' items, as they frequently contained collectable merchandise ranging from photo booklets (for the live releases), full length posters and stickers to removable tattoos.

Two more highly successful studio albums were released in less than a year: November 11, 1976's Rock and Roll Over and June 30, 1977's Love Gun.

The band had recorded their first live album after their first three studio albums; and they had now released three studio albums since Alive!. So, right on schedule, they released the sequel to Alive! on November 29, 1977, titled Alive II.

Alive II was a double album, as the first live album had been. But this album had three live sides with a fourth side of newly recorded studio material. Kramer continued as producer for Alive II, this time co-credited along with the band.

On the newly recorded songs, Frehley was replaced by Bob Kulick (who auditioned for KISS but lost out to Frehley) on four of the five tracks. Frehley played only on the song he wrote and sang, ""Rocket Ride"". However, Kulick was instructed by Simmons and Stanley to try to sound as much like Frehley as he could.

The first of what is now many KISS greatest hits albums, titled Double Platinum, was issued on April 2, 1978. This double album included many remixed versions of their hits, non-hits, and ""Strutter '78,"" a newly recorded version of the popular song, using a drum machine to cash in on the Disco sound, from the band's first album.

Going solo (1978)

Flushed with the success of Love Gun and its subsequent tour, KISS and creative manager Bill Aucoin sought to take the band to the next level of popularity. To that end, an ambitious, two-pronged strategy was devised for 1978.

The first part involved the simultaneous release of four solo albums from the members of KISS. While each album was very much a solo effort, they were all released and marketed as KISS albums (with similar cover art and poster inserts). It was the first time in history that all current members of a rock and roll band had released solo albums at the same time.

For the band members, it was a chance to showcase their individual musical styles and tastes outside of KISS, and in some cases to collaborate with contemporary artists (Simmons's album featured appearances by the likes of Aerosmith's Joe Perry, Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen, disco diva Donna Summer, and then-girlfriend Cher). Stanley's and Frehley's stuck pretty closely to the successful hard rock style that KISS had utilized. Criss's album featured an R&B style and was loaded with ballads, while Simmons's was the most eclectic of the four. It featured hard rock, ballads, Beatles-influenced pop and ended with a straight cover of ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" (from Walt Disney's ""Pinocchio"").

The KISS solo albums were released on September 18, 1978. The marketing blitz behind the albums was unprecedented - Casablanca announced it was shipping five million total copies of the albums (guaranteeing instant platinum status), and they spent US$2.5 million marketing them. Despite all four solo albums making it into the Top 50 of the Billboard album chart, the massive preorder for these albums was soon followed by a just as enormous attempt to ship them back to the record company, followed by the subsequent discounting of these albums once sales had (very quickly) peaked. All four albums combined sold about as many copies as Love Gun alone had. The albums were also the first KISS albums to be seen in the ""bargain bins"" of many record stores, and it was the first clear harbinger of KISS's waning popularity. Of the four, Frehley's album was the most successful (although not by a huge margin) and spawned the only radio top 20 hit (Russ Ballard's composition ""New York Groove"").

The second part of KISS's and Aucoin's plan called for the band to appear in a movie that would cement their image as larger than life superheroes. Filming for the movie, entitled KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park, commenced in the spring of 1978. The film was proposed to the band as a cross between A Hard Day's Night and Star Wars, though the final results fell far short of these expectations. The script underwent numerous rewrites, and the band (particularly Criss and Frehley) grew increasingly frustrated with the process. Criss refused to take part in post-production, and so his entire voice track was completely over-dubbed by another actor.

The picture was reportedly filmed completely out of proper frame by the cinematographer, resulting in much of what was supposed to be on screen missing from the final product. Also, the film employed stunt doubles for KISS who were physically dissimilar to the band members themselves, which is obvious in several scenes. In some instances, Frehley was replaced by an African American stunt double in Spaceman makeup and costume, as Stanley pointed out in VH1's ""KISS: Beyond the Make-Up.""

The movie, produced by Hanna-Barbera, aired on NBC on October 28, 1978. Despite scathing reviews, it was one of the highest-rated TV movies of the year, and saw theatrical release outside the U.S. in 1979 under the title Attack of the Phantoms. While later interviews with band members would have them talk about their movie making experience with a mix of humorous embarrassment and regret as to the finished product, their unhappiness with the final product was well-known to those around them. They felt that the movie ended up portraying them more as clowns than superheroes. The artistic failure of the movie led to the a rift between the band and Aucoin, who they blamed for it.

Late makeup years (1979-83)

The band's first album of new material in two years, Dynasty (May 23, 1979), continued their platinum streak. The album contained what would become the biggest single in the history of the band, the worldwide smash ""I Was Made For Lovin' You."" The song, which combined elements of the KISS sound with disco, was a top ten hit throughout the world (although stateside, it only managed number 11) and stands as the most covered KISS song ever.

In Australia, the song became what is believed to be Kiss' only No 1 hit anywhere, paving the way for a follow up Top 10 hit, ""Sure Know Something"" and a sellout tour the following year.

This album, as well as the follow-up, Unmasked, were recorded using ghost drummer Anton Fig (later of the Late Night with David Letterman/Late Show with David Letterman band) at the request of producer Vini Poncia, who felt that Criss's drumming skills were not adequate. The only contribution made by the increasingly discontented Criss to Dynasty was ""Dirty Livin'"", which he co-wrote and sang.

The tour for Dynasty in 1979 saw once-sold-out arenas being replaced with half- to three-fourths-filled venues, and even a two night homecoming in July 1979 at New York's Madison Square Garden did not see the usual full houses, leaving the New York Daily News to wonder aloud if this was to be ""The Last Monster Mash."" Although the audiences who did show up were for the most part as enthusiastic as ever, reviews of these shows were mixed, as visible tensions within the band began taking their toll on the quality of the music.

As further evidence of bad blood within the band, fans point to an October 31, 1979 interview of the band on Tom Snyder's late night The Tomorrow Show, where a visibly irritated Simmons and Stanley, as well as a bored Criss, all but walk out on a bombastic Frehley, whose infectious but over-the-top laughter overshadow the content and conversation that takes place between harried interviewer Snyder and the rest of the band. This offbeat interview, where KISS looked completely uncomfortable together, would prove to be the last appearance the original line-up of KISS would make on television for almost twenty years.

However, these disagreements were hardly noticed by KISS's new fan base. The crowds were very much younger than previous audiences had been, with many pre-adolescent children in KISS makeup with their mothers and fathers (who were sometimes wearing the makeup themselves!) in tow at most concerts. KISS themselves did little to dissuade this new fan base, donning colorful costumes that reinforced a cartoonish image for these younger fans.

At this point, the problems and disagreements within the band took their toll. Criss, not happy with the change in the group's fan base and wrestling with his own feelings about the band's current direction (not to mention his increasing substance abuse issues), left the band shortly after the May 20, 1980 release of Unmasked. Criss appeared in the music video for the song ""Shandi"", but did not contribute in any way to the recording of the album.

Despite a slick, contemporary pop sound, Unmasked had the dubious distinction of being the first KISS album since Dressed to Kill to fail to go platinum. The tour to support Unmasked never reached the U.S., save for a one-off show at New York's now defunct Palladium Theatre to showcase new drummer Eric Carr (born Paul Caravello on June 12, 1950 in Brooklyn, New York City; died November 24, 1991). The band's 1980 tour of Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, was one of the biggest in their history, as they played to sold-out crowds and enjoyed enormous popularity amongst the fans there.

For their next album, the band once again approached Bob Ezrin, with whom KISS had found success on Destroyer. Early press reports indicated that the new album would be a return to the hard rock style that had originally brought the band success. What was released instead was 1981's (Music from) The Elder, a concept album featuring medieval horns, strings, harps, synthesizers and Gregorian Chant-style vocalizing.

The album was presented as a soundtrack to a film that was never made, making it difficult (if not impossible) to follow the storyline. To make matters worse, having received negative feedback from their record company's preview of the album, KISS altered the record's track sequence in most countries to emphasize potential singles ""The Oath"" and ""A World Without Heroes,"" which all but guaranteed the inability of listeners to understand the already muddled storyline. Although the band presented a mystical, progressive rock sound on the LP, their appearance took on an incongruous ""new wave"" look, with short and spiky hairdos, and simplified black-spandex costumes. Once released, fan reaction to The Elder was equally harsh; it failed to go gold and couldn't climb past number 75 on the Billboard Album Chart.

Frehley, upset with the band's decision to record a concept album, did not actively participate in the album's creation. He literally ""mailed in"" his only contributions, the songs ""Escape From The Island"" and ""Dark Light.""

KISS did not perform any of the music from this album in their concerts until their subsequent ""Unplugged"" reunion fifteen years later. However, the band appeared on the ABC late-night variety program Fridays in January of 1982 and performed three songs from the album: ""The Oath"", ""A World Without Heroes"", and ""I"".

Four leftover songs from a planned ""heavier"" album were combined with classic KISS material from the 1970s for the May 10, 1982 release Killers, a compilation album released outside the United States. Bob Kulick played on the four newer songs, again being instructed to replicate Frehley's style as closely as possible.

The band soon made major changes to their business dealings, severing ties with their manager of nine years, Bill Aucoin, and cutting back on their unwieldy organizational tree.

By this time Frehley had already decided to leave the band, but Simmons and Stanley needed for their record company to believe that Frehley was still in KISS in order for the band to keep its contract. So to keep up appearances they included him in the original cover art of their next album, 1982's Creatures of the Night, although Frehley did not play a note on it.

This album was the heaviest album the band had released up to that point. In Frehley's absence, KISS utilized a number of guitarists for the recording of Creatures, including Steve Ferris, Bob Kulick and Vincent Cusano (who would soon be known as Vinnie Vincent).

The album featured tracks co-written by Adam Mitchell (who worked with KISS again in 1987), Canadian singer/songwriter Bryan Adams (who had also co-written a song on Killers) and his writing partner Jim Vallance. In a situation similar to that of Criss on Unmasked, Frehley appears in the music video for the song ""I Love It Loud,"" despite not having played on the track.

Creatures of the Night fared better than (Music From) The Elder, yet it couldn't make it past number 45 on the charts and was not certified gold until 1994. The day after shooting the video for the song ""I Love It Loud,"" Frehley officially left the band and was replaced permanently by Vinnie Vincent (born Vincent Cusano on August 6, 1952) in time for the band's ""10th Anniversary"" tour.

Vincent's hurriedly-developed identity was that of an Egyptian warrior (with a gold ankh painted on his face), although he would not need this persona for very long. While the tour was a commercial disappointment in the US, the band did go on to play for the largest crowds of their career elsewhere, including up to 203,000 fans in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on June 18, 1983. The Rio show was one of the last concerts KISS would perform in makeup until June 21, 1996.

Unmasking (1983-95)

Sensing it was time for a change, KISS appeared in public without makeup for the first time with a September 18, 1983 appearance on MTV. The appearance coincided with the release of the band's new album, Lick It Up. The album cover featured the band, without their trademark makeup, photographed against a plain white background. However, in a possible signal to their fans that KISS would still be KISS, Simmons still allowed his trademark tongue to wag. Lick It Up became their first gold record in three years, and the band successfully toured the US for the first time since 1979 (albeit in smaller venues). Due to quickly rising tensions between Vincent and the rest of KISS (particularly Simmons and Stanley), Vincent was fired after the Lick It Up tour. Mark St. John (born Mark Norton on February 7, 1956 in Hollywood, California), replaced Vincent. His rapid, ""shredding"" technique was very much in favor at the time.

Animalize (1984) built on the success of Lick It Up and was the band's best-selling record during the decade. With the success of the album and subsequent tour, KISS had clearly recaptured their niche (though not to the level of their '70s heyday). ""Heaven's on Fire"" saw heavy airplay on MTV. St. John, however, was soon taken ill with Reiter's syndrome and left the band shortly into the 1984 Animalize tour. Bruce Kulick (born December 12, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York City) became KISS's new lead guitarist, and would remain with the group for the next 12 years.

For the rest of the 1980s, KISS turned out a series of best-selling albums: 1985's Asylum, 1987's Crazy Nights and the 1988 greatest hits compilation Smashes, Thrashes & Hits. ""Crazy, Crazy Nights"" from the Crazy Nights album hit #4 on the singles chart in Britain, where it is KISS' highest charting single behind their Australian #1 in 1979. Smashes, Thrashes & Hits contained a controversial re-recording of the lead vocal to ""Beth."" The song, long a trademark of original drummer Peter Criss, now featured lead vocals by Eric Carr.

KISS ended the '80s with the 1989 release Hot in the Shade. Although the album failed to achieve platinum status, it spawned the early 1990 hit ballad ""Forever,"" co-written by Michael Bolton. Peaking at #8, it was the group's highest-charting single since ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"" and would be the band's last Top 10 single.

During these non-makeup years, KISS struggled with their identity and fan base. Simmons, arguably the dominating force in KISS during the '70s, became less involved with the group in the '80s as he pursued outside interests; most notably, a film career. After the band's unmasking, he struggled with the loss of the Demon persona. During this time, Stanley became the dominant force in KISS.

In an attempt to distance themselves from their comic-book superhero image of the 1970's, KISS began to position themselves as more of an adult-oriented band, as is evidenced by their use of adult language and sexual promiscuity on concert videos such as KISS: Animalize Live Uncensored and the bawdy ""home tour"" in KISS - Exposed.

The band decided to once again enlist Bob Ezrin to produce their first album of the 1990s. Before recording could begin in earnest, however, tragedy struck. In September 1990, Eric Carr was hospitalized after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. While hospitalized, it was discovered that he had cancer of the heart. He died on November 24, 1991 at the age of 41 (incidentally, the same day as Freddie Mercury).[3]

Though devastated, KISS continued, bringing in former Black Sabbath, Gary Moore, Lita Ford, and Alice Cooper drummer Eric Singer (born Eric Mensinger on May 12, 1958 in Cleveland, Ohio). Singer had also been in the band that Stanley put together for a 1989 club tour.

KISS released their critically acclaimed Revenge on May 18, 1992. it featured a leaner, harder-edged sound, as indicated by the first single, ""Unholy."" In a surprise move, KISS enlisted the aid of Vinnie Vincent for songwriting duties. The album debuted in the Top 10 and went gold. KISS ""tuned up"" for a major tour with many small club dates throughout the U.S., where they supported Revenge and were able to be seen in intimate settings for the first time since the early days of the band. KISS followed Revenge with the release of Alive III on May 14, 1993.

Four days later, on May 18, 1993, KISS was inducted into the RockWalk of Fame, at Guitar Center on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard. RockWalk inductions are voted on by previous RockWalk inductees, making this truly a musician's award, rather than a critic's award.

During this period, KISS nostalgia started to pick up steam. In June 1994, the band issued KISS My Ass, a compilation album featuring popular artists of the era putting their own spin on KISS songs. The result was an eclectic mix of sounds, ranging from Lenny Kravitz putting a funky stamp on ""Deuce"" (with Stevie Wonder on harmonica), a ska version of ""Detroit Rock City"" by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, to Garth Brooks' straightforward take on ""Hard Luck Woman,"" with KISS themselves as his backup band.

In 1995, the band embarked on a unique and well-received ""Worldwide KISS Convention Tour."" The conventions were all-day events, featuring displays of vintage KISS stage outfits, instruments and memorabilia, performances by KISS cover bands, and dealers selling KISS merchandise from every stage of the band's career up to that time. KISS appeared live at the conventions, conducted question and answer sessions, signed autographs and performed a two-hour acoustic set comprised mostly of spontaneous fan requests. On the first U.S. date, June 17, 1995, Peter Criss appeared onstage with KISS to sing on ""Hard Luck Woman"" and on ""Nothin' to Lose."" It was the first time Criss had performed publicly with the band in nearly 16 years.

On August 9, 1995, KISS joined the long line of musicians to perform on MTV Unplugged. The band contacted Criss and Frehley and invited them to participate in the event. Both joined KISS onstage for several songs at the end of the set: ""Beth,"" ""2000 Man,"" ""Nothin' to Lose"" and ""Rock and Roll All Nite.""

The Unplugged appearance set off months of speculation that a possible reunion of the original KISS lineup was in the works. In the weeks following the Unplugged concert, however, the band (with Kulick and Singer), returned to the studio for the first time in three years to record Carnival of Souls. The album was completed, but its release was delayed for two years. Bootleg copies of the album circulated widely among fans.

While KISS continued to exist publicly as Simmons, Stanley, Kulick and Singer, arrangements for a reunion of the original lineup were in the works. These efforts culminated with a public event as dramatic as any the band had staged since their 1983 unmasking on MTV.

Reunion (1996-2002)
   
""You know how the Grammys used to be, all straight-looking folks with suits. Everybody looking tired. No surprises. We tired of that. We need something new ...""

With that statement on February 28, 1996, the late Tupac Shakur introduced the original KISS lineup (clad in full makeup and Love Gun era stage outfits), to a rousing ovation at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards. On April 16, the band held a press conference aboard the USS Intrepid in New York, where they announced their plans for a full-fledged reunion tour, with the help of manager Doc McGhee. The conference, emceed by Conan O'Brien, was simulcast to 58 countries.

The first public concert featuring the newly reunited KISS was an hour-long warm up show on June 21st for KROQ's 4th annual Weenie Roast in Irvine, CA. During the show the band nearly ignited the stage of the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. On June 28, the ""KISS Alive Worldwide"" tour officially kicked off at Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Michigan in front of a sold-out crowd of 39,867 fans. Tickets for the show sold out in 45 minutes. The tour earned $43.6 million, making KISS the top-drawing concert act of 1996.

In September 1998, the reunited group issued Psycho Circus. Despite the appearance as the first album with the original lineup since 1977's Love Gun, once again the contributions of Frehley and Criss were minimal. While the images of Frehley and Criss are featured prominently on the album, most of the lead guitar work was later revealed to have been performed by future band member Tommy Thayer and former member Bruce Kulick. Most drum duties were handled by session musician Kevin Valentine. Despite the controversy, the album achieved a #3 chart debut, the highest ever position for a KISS album. The title track received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.

The Psycho Circus tour opened at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California on Halloween night 1998, and was simulcast on FM radio across the US. It proved to be another success, and was historic for being the first to ever incorporate 3-D visuals into a stage show.

On August 11, 1999, KISS was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the ""Recording Industry"" category. August 13, 1999 saw the nationwide premiere of a KISS-themed motion picture titled Detroit Rock City. The movie was set in 1978, focusing on four teenagers (featuring Edward Furlong) willing to do anything to score tickets for a sold-out KISS show in Detroit.

The quartet announced in the spring of 2000 that they would be launching a U.S. Farewell tour in the summer, which became one of the year's top concert draws. The same year also saw the release of a computer game, ""KISS Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child.""

But on the eve of a Japanese and Australian tour in early 2001, Criss suddenly left the band once again, reportedly unhappy with his salary. Taking his place was previous KISS drummer Singer, who, in a controversial move among longtime fans, donned Criss's Cat Man makeup as the ""Farewell Tour"" continued.[5] (Simmons and Stanley own both Frehley's and Criss's makeup designs, so there was no way for Criss to prevent this.)

With the band scheduled to call it a day supposedly by late 2001, a career-encompassing Box Set (94 tracks over five discs) was released in November, while the summer saw perhaps the most over-the-top piece of KISS merchandise yet -- the KISS Kasket.

The group was relatively quiet through the rest of the year, but 2002 started with a bang as Simmons turned in an entertaining and controversial interview on National Public Radio where he criticized NPR and berated host Terry Gross with sexual comments and condescending answers. He was promoting his autobiography at the time, which also caused dissension in the KISS camp because of the inflammatory remarks made towards Frehley. Frehley was quite angry at the situation, leading to his no-show at an American Bandstand anniversary show.

2. Kiss (키스 or K.I.S.S.) was a Korean female pop trio. Their debut single ""Because I'm a Girl"" was a hit in 2001. The music video stars actress Goo Hye-jin, and actor Shin Hyun-joon, which increased initial public interest in the song. The song remained a karaoke staple in Korea for many years.

This helped to launch the career of Kiss, with an album quickly following. However, the group quickly disbanded afterwards, due to internal conflict that could not be resolved.

""Because I'm a Girl"" has been covered by numerous artists, including Korean female duo 2NB.

3) Kiss (was a short lived Taiwanese group made up of three girls, Cai Pei Lin (蔡裴琳), Zhang Shuo Fen (张硕芬) and Wang Tingxuan (王婷萱), in the late 90’s early 2000. They only released one full length album (Let's Wait and See), and one CD single (Shut Up). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kiss"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Born on June 7, 1993, and the son of an art teacher, Ezra grew up in Hertford attending Bengeo primary school and then Simon Balle Secondary School, before moving to Bristol, England in 2011 to pursue a music degree at the influential music school ""BIMM"". 

Ezra's music is described as deep, bluesy and mournful - particularly in tracks such as ""Budapest"" - and is peppered with influences from the likes of Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie. Richard Pitt from BBC Bristol aptly described Ezra as ""a young man with the voice of a 50 year old”.

White Lies,"There are at least three artists who have used this name
1. A popular indie band from London, England
2. A singer from Belgium
3. A rock band from Devon, England

1) A three-piece London indie band formed from the ashes of Fear Of Flying in late 2007.  The line-up consists of singer/guitarist Harry McVeigh, bassist/lyricist Charles Cave and drummer Jack Brown. Unfinished Business (released April 29th 2007) was their first single, released on Jack Brown's label Chess Club Records. This single was released on a vinyl 7"" format only and was limited to 500 copies. Death followed next (released Sept 22nd 2007). It peaked at #52 in the UK singles chart and was available on 2 x 7"" and CD format. On December 29th 2008 From The Stars became the next release from White Lies, although this time only on digital release through iTunes.

Their debut album, To Lose My Life, was released on January 19th 2009, preceded by the album title track and fourth single To Lose My Life one week earlier. The album was recorded in the summer of 2008 in Brussels with producers Max Dingel and Ed Buller.

 Ritual , their second album, was released on January 17th, 2011. Album has been produced by Alan Moulder.

2) White Lies was a one piece band consisting of Haydé Walraet from Belgium. Currently known as   Haydé. She had her small claim to fame with her cover of the Kaiser Chiefs' song, ""Heat Dies Down"" which was accepted as a heart warming cover considering Haydé had minimal live footage to work with to re-interpret it her own way.

She also covered the Little Man Tate song ""You And Me Might Be Alright, You Know"" which used the same technique of acoustic guitar, layered, precious vocals and simple harmonies throughout.

But she is not just a cover artist, Haydé also writes her own songs and released a demo of seven of them in the latter half of 2006. Her style is often simple and laid back with songs to calm the mind and ease you into the day. Her demo was again confronted with good press who saw her demo as a humane approach to life from the eyes of a young girl.


3) White Lies was an Exeter, Devon, United Kingdom based alternative rock band. The first years of the bands career, they were going under the name Rota. In 2004 the band released their self-titled album White Lies, having received positive reviews. Although in 2005 the band went its seperate ways, with each member having his own new band.

Bright Eyes,"Bright Eyes is an indie rock band consisting mainly of American singer, guitarist, and songwriter Conor Oberst. Bright Eyes also features multi-instrumentalist/producer Mike Mogis, keyboard player Nate Walcott and a rotating lineup of collaborators drawn primarily from Omaha, Nebraska, United States' indie music scene.  Having been deeply influenced early on by singer-songwriters David Dondero and Simon Joyner, Conor Oberst has been recording music since the age of 13. He released his first three albums at the ages of 13, 14, 15, respectively, all under the name ""Conor Oberst"" and released only on cassettes.  He then moved onwards with a band called Commander Venus with whom he released two albums. After the break-up of this band in 1997, Conor's main focus became Bright Eyes, and in 1998 he released the first Bright Eyes album, A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995-1997(a collection of 20 stockpiled songs) on the independent label Saddle Creek Records, which he had co-formed earlier  in collaboration with fellow local Omaha musicians. 

Saddle Creek also released Letting Off the Happiness in November 1998, a ten-track record that boasted a much more focused and clear sound than the previous album. According to the Saddle Creek press release, it features members of Lullaby for the Working Class, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Of Montreal. It was predominantly recorded in the Oberst family basement in Omaha on an analog eight track reel to reel; with some work also done at keyboardist Andy Lemaster's Athens, GA studio. Although almost all of the tracks feature a full band, June on the West Coast is performed with only acoustic guitar and vocals. Padraic My Prince gives a dramatic fictional account of the death of Oberst's imagined baby brother. 

In 2000 Bright Eyes released Fevers and Mirrors, a demonstration of the immense improvement in production quality and musical vision of the band. New instruments such as flute, piano, and accordion were introduced into the song arrangements. After An Attempt to Tip the Scales, a mock radio interview takes place. The mock radio interview features Todd Fink of The Faint doing an impression of Conor Oberst while reading a script that Oberst wrote. The man interviewing is Matt Silcock, a former member of Lullaby for the Working Class. In this interview, the fake Oberst intentionally presents a strange, contradictory explanation of his attitude towards his music. The interview acknowledges criticisms of his lyrics as overblown and insincere, which had begun to appear as the popularity of the band increased, but responds by stating that the lyrics are meant for personal interpretation. In a 'real' interview with KittyMagik.com, Oberst stated about the mock one: ""It was a way to make fun of ourselves because the record is such a downer. I mean, that's one part of who I am, but I also like laughing and fucking around.""

2002 saw the release of Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground, and since then Oberst has released an almost constant stream of new material on collaborative EPs, split singles, tribute albums, and charity records. He ventured into the studio with Nebraska folk-pop outfit Tilly And The Wall, co-producing their debut album Wild Like Children and released it on his newly established record label, Team Love.

January 2005 saw the release of two albums: I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning, which is a country-tinged mélange of Conor’s finest acoustic songs, featuring guest vocal appearances from Emmylou Harris and Jim James of My Morning Jacket; and Digital Ash In A Digital Urn, which is a more produced, electronic album featuring cameo appearances by Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. 
One single from each album, Take It Easy (Love Nothing) from Digital Ash and Lua from I'm Wide Awake took the top two slots on Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart, the first time for any artist since 1997.
As had become expected of Bright Eyes recordings, the albums feature an array of talented comrades including members of Rilo Kiley, Tilly And The Wall, Cursive, Now Its Overhead, The Good Life, Azure Ray, The Faint, The Bruces, Neva Dinova, The Postal Service and Audrye Sessions.

In October 2006, Bright Eyes released a compilation of rare tracks called Noise Floor: Rarities 1998-2005.

Bright Eyes released their sixth studio album called Cassadaga on April 9, 2007, preceded by an EP entitled Four Winds on March 6, 2007.
A further 25-30 tracks have been recorded in Portland, Oregon and New York City, with another session planned in Omaha, Nebraska. Some of these tracks had already been performed at live shows.

On February 15, 2011, the band released their seventh studio album, The People's Key.

Judas Priest,"Judas Priest are pioneers of the heavy metal genre, and arguably created the ""metal"" look. Priest were one of the bands that helped spur the heavy metal genre's evolution by discarding most of its blues influence, and created a ""metallic"" sound which inspired generations of metal bands to come. Judas Priest were one of the first heavy metal bands and are considered one of the most influential bands in the genre, helping the evolution of speed and thrash metal in the 80s. 

K. K. Downing and bassist Ian Hill had known each other since early childhood, as they lived near one another and attended the same nursery and school in West Bromwich. They became close friends in their early teens, when they shared similar musical interests (Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Cream, The Yardbirds) and learned to play instruments. The band was founded in 1969 in Birmingham, England, United Kingdom, after a local ensemble named Judas Priest (after Bob Dylan's song ""The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest""  from the John Wesley Harding album) split up. The band's singer, Al Atkins, approached Downing and Hill, who were playing as a power trio with drummer John Ellis, and asked if he could become their singer. With Atkins now in the band, Downing suggested they change their name to Judas Priest as he had been a fan of the original band.

Later, in 1972, Rob Halford and drummer John Hinch joined to replace Atkins and Partridge, respectively. A second guitarist, Glenn Tipton, was also added to the line-up in 1974 as compensation for their record company's (Gull Records) suggestion to add a horn section to the first album, Rocka Rolla.

Downing and Tipton's harmonised guitar lines were not particularly common at the time, but became a trademark for the group and would inspire other bands such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Megadeth to do the same. It is now a standard feature of many heavy metal bands and appears in many of metal's sub-genres.

The band featuring Halford, Downing, Tipton and Hill would go on to record 14 albums from 1974 through to 1990. Their second album, Sad Wings of Destiny (released in 1976), is considered one of the most influential metal albums along with Black Sabbath's self-titled début.

Priest went through a considerable number of drummers between their formation and 1980 when Dave Holland joined and stayed until 1988's Ram It Down, and this is arguably the inspiration for Spinal Tap's misfortune with drummers. Racer X drummer Scott Travis joined the band to record 1990's Painkiller album and has been with the band ever since.

1980 saw Priest release perhaps their most famous album, British Steel, which featured a more focused and sleek approach to metal than previous efforts. This, coupled with catchy, fist-pumping riffs and memorable vocal melodies ensured the band a string of consecutive platinum selling albums. Fans were slightly disillusioned with 1986's Turbo, which featured electronic drums and synthesised guitars, but the band were still selling out arenas worldwide.

Halford left the group in 1993, going in a new direction with his new, short-lived metal band, Fight and, later, 2wo. He began a successful solo career with his own self-titled band in 1999.

With Halford gone, the future looked bleak for the band, but after numerous searches for a suitable replacement, they found something special in tribute band front man Tim ""Ripper"" Owens. This story forms the basic plot of the movie ""Rock Star,"" which was originally to be completely about Judas Priest and the Ripper, titled ""Metal God,"" but the script was altered after the failure to reach an agreement with the band.  Judas Priest recorded 4 albums with Owens (2 studio, 2 live records) which were greeted with mixed reactions from fans. 

In 2003, the Judas Priest's 1990 line-up was restored when Rob Halford returned to the group after rekindling the relationship during work on Judas Priest's 4-CD career retrospective ""Metalogy."" In 2004 the band played Ozzfest and released a CD of new studio material entitled Angel of Retribution and an accompanying live DVD in 2005, enjoying a successful world tour that year. 

After an emotional reunion, extensive tour and new studio album, the band released a follow-up album in June 2008, entitled Nostradamus. Unusually for Priest, this album was a double CD and was their first conceptual album; based upon the life and predictions of Nostradamus, which instilled a mixed reaction among fans.

In 2011, KK Downing announced his retirement. The band itself stated that their next world tour, Epitaph, would be their last. Downing's replacement is the former guitarist for Steve Harris's daughter, Lauren Harris. The new guitarist was born in 1980 when Judas Priest was on the British Steel tour. His name is Richie Faulkner.

In July 2014, Judas Priest released their latest album 'Redeemer of Souls'. This was the first Judas Priest studio album not to feature KK Downing, and instead feature Richie Faulkner. The album was received with much success, and Ian Hill named it Priest's best album yet. Later in 2014, Judas Priest embarked on their Redeemer of Souls world tour, and are due to play Download Festival in June 2015.

James Brown,"James Brown (b. James Joseph Brown, 3 May 1933, in Barnwell, SC, USA – d. 25 Dec 2006), is recognized as one of the most influential figures in 20th century music. He was a seminal force in the evolution of gospel  and rhythm and blues into soul and funk. He has also left his mark on numerous other musical genres, including rock, jazz, reggae, disco, dance and electronic music, and hip-hop music.

Joining Bobby Byrd's vocal group The Famous Flames, in 1955, Brown's early mid-50s recordings were fairly straightforward gospel-inspired R&B compositions, heavily influenced by contemporaries, including: Ray Charles and Little Richard, who was particularly significant in Brown's development as a musician and showman.

Brown followed his successful Live at the Apollo (1963), with a string of singles that - along with the work of Allen Toussaint, in New Orleans - essentially defined the foundation of funk music.  During the mid-1960s, two of Brown's signature tunes Papa's Got a Brand New Bag and I Got You (I Feel Good) (both from 1965), were his first Top 10 pop hits, as well as major #1 R&B hits - each remaining the top-selling singles, in black venues, for over a month.  As the 1960s neared their end, Brown continued to refine the new funk idiom.  His 1967 #1 R&B hit, Cold Sweat - sometimes cited as the first true funk song - was the first of his recordings to contain a drum break and harmony reduced to a single chord change.

His recordings influenced many contemporaries / followers, most immediately:  Sly & The Family Stone, Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, Booker T. & the M.G.'s, Edwin Starr, The Temptations, David Ruffin, Dennis Edwards and The Jackson 5's young lead singer, Michael Jackson, took Brown's shouts / dancing into pop mainstream.  Many Clyde Stubblefield (drums) / The Famous Flames tracks were resurrected, from the 1970s onward, by countless hip-hop musicians.  As a result, Brown / Stubblefield quickly became, and remain, the world's most sampled recording artists, with their Funky Drummer break becoming the most sampled individual piece of music, the Funky Drummer break.

By 1970 Brown and Byrd employed a new band that included future funk greats, such as bassist Bootsy Collins, Collins' guitarist brother Phelps 'Catfish' Collins and trombonist and musical director Fred Wesley. This new backing band was dubbed The J.B.'s, and the band made its debut on Brown's 1970 single Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine.

Many of his sidemen and supporting players, such as Fred Wesley & The J.B.'s, Bobby Byrd, Lyn Collins, Vicki Anderson and Hank Ballard, released records on Brown's People label. The recordings on the People label, almost all of which were produced by Brown himself, exemplified his ""house style"". Songs such as I Know You Got Soul by Bobby Byrd, Think (About It) by Lyn Collins and Doing It to Death by Fred Wesley & The J.B.'s are considered as much a part of Brown's recorded legacy as the recordings released under his own name.

Although he would continue tour and rack up hit records into the 2000s, By the mid-1970s Brown's star-status was on the wane, and key musicians in his band such as Fred Wesley left to join Parliament and Funkadelic. The onslaught of the slickly commercial style of disco caught Brown off guard, as it superseded his raw style of funk music on the dance floor.

Brown is recognized by a plethora of (mostly self-bestowed) titles, including ""Soul Brother Number One,"" ""Mr. Dynamite,"" ""the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business,"" ""Minister of New New Super-Heavy Funk,"" ""Universal James,"" and the best-known, ""the Godfather of Soul."" He is renowned for his shouting vocals, feverish dancing and unique rhythmic style.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Brown was a presence in American political affairs, noted especially for his activism on behalf of African Americans and the poor. James Brown died early on 25 Dec 2006, having been admitted to hospital suffering from pneumonia. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

ZZ Top,"ZZ Top is an American blues rock band, formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. The band members are Billy Gibbons (vocals and guitar), Dusty Hill (bass guitar and vocals), and Frank Beard (drums). They hold the distinction of being one of the few rock bands still comprised of its original members for over 40 years, and until 2006, with the same manager/producer, Bill Ham.

They reached the peak of their commercial success in the 1970s and 1980s, scoring many hit songs during that era; but they remain together today and are still touring and releasing albums. ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 2004. Summarizing their music, Cub Koda wrote, ""As genuine roots musicians, they have few peers; Gibbons is one of America's finest blues guitarists working in the arena rock idiom ... while Hill and Beard provide the ultimate rhythm section support.""[1] Their song lyrics often feature sexual innuendo and humor.

Nearly as well-known as their music is the group's appearance: Gibbons and Hill are always pictured wearing sunglasses (a nod to their 1979 song ""Cheap Sunglasses""), similar (if not matching) clothing, and their trademark chest-length beards, while Beard sports a mustache but not a beard. In 1984, the Gillette Company reportedly offered Gibbons and Hill US$1 million apiece to shave their beards for a television commercial, but they declined.

The origin of the band's name was not officially known for many years. Some theories included: the two brands of rolling paper, Zig-Zag and Top; a tribute to blues legend Z. Z. Hill; Z-shaped barn-door braces Gibbons once saw at a farm; and/or Billy Gibbons seeing the two words running together on a dilapidated bill board. The real origin, as told by Billy Gibbons and also recorded in his new book (Rock + Roll Gearhead), is derived from the name of blues master B.B. King. They wanted to call themselves Z.Z. King but sounded too similar to their blues legend hero. They figured that ""King"" was at the ""top"" so thus settled on ZZ Top.

The men who would form ZZ Top had played in several different Texas-based groups (including the Moving Sidewalks, The Cellar Dwellers, The Hustlers, The Warlocks and American Blues) before joining forces in late 1969.

They toured almost continually for several years, but first gained wide acclaim with their third album, Tres Hombres (1973). It contained the classic song ""La Grange"", referencing the bordello that is the subject of the musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.

The band continued touring, recording, and releasing albums until 1977, when they took an extended hiatus. Their long-time manager/producer/image maker Bill Ham used this time to negotiate a deal that allowed the band to keep control of their previous recordings, which would be distributed by their new label, Warner Brothers. They reunited two and a half years later in order to start recording under that new Warner Brothers contract. Unbeknown to the other, both Hill and Gibbons had grown the chest-length beards that quickly became a part of their ""wildman"" image.

They reached new heights of popularity with the 1983 album Eliminator, boosted to prominence by memorable music videos for the tracks ""Gimme All Your Lovin'"", ""Legs"" and ""Sharp-Dressed Man"" each of which featured a small bright red Ford '34 3 window hotrod called The Eliminator and a trio of mysterious, beautiful women who travel around helping various people. The album also featured a distinctive synthesizer-laced sound--a rarity in the blues rock genre--which added a modern, new wave edge to the music, and helped the album become successful. Eliminator remains their most successful album to date.

Their next album, Afterburner, mostly featured the same blend of synthesizers, sequencers and blues rock. Some critics have expressed frustration at this approach. But on subsequent albums, less and less synth- and synchronizer-influenced music is heard. An occasional song with those elements and instruments is included on recent albums as a nod to their past.

In 1994, ZZ Top signed a five-disc deal with RCA Record. Many fans (or, as they refer to themselves, ""fanzz"") feel that the recordings of this era are as artistically strong as the earlier London and Warner Brothers recordings, but have expressed disappointment with RCA's promotion of these releases. On several occasions Billy Gibbons was overheard refering to the execs at RCA as ""a bunch of cock suckers"". 

In July 2000, while on tour in Europe, Hill was diagnosed with Hepatitis C, which forced the cancellation of several dates in that tour. Hill has since made a remarkable recovery, joking, ""You just can't keep down ZZ Top!""

In 2003, a comprehensive collection of recordings from the London and Warner Brother years entitled ""Chrome, Smoke & BBQ"" was released.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (born Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart; 27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791) is among the most significant and enduring popular composers of European classical music. His enormous output includes works that are widely acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music.  Many of his works are part of the standard concert repertoire and are widely recognized as masterpieces of classical music.

The central traits of the classical style can all be identified in Mozart's music.  Clarity, balance, and transparency are hallmarks, though a simplistic notion of the delicacy of his music obscures for us the exceptional and even demonic power of some of his finest masterpieces, such as the Piano Concerto No 24 in C minor, K. 491, the Symphony No 40 in G minor, K. 550, and the opera Don Giovanni. The famed writer on music Charles Rosen has written (in The Classical Style): ""It is only through recognizing the violence and sensuality at the center of Mozart's work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way, Schumann's superficial characterization of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous."" Especially during his last decade, Mozart explored chromatic harmony to a degree rare at the time. The slow introduction to the ""Dissonant"" Quartet, K. 465, a work that Haydn greatly admired, rapidly explodes a shallow understanding of Mozart's style as light and pleasant.

Born in Salzburg, Austria, from his earliest years Mozart had a gift for imitating the music he heard; which his father believed was a gift from God.  

Since he traveled widely, he acquired a rare collection of experiences from various bordels to create his unique compositional language. When he went to London[13] as a child, he met J.C. Bach and heard his music; when he went to Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna, he heard the work of composers active there, as well as the spectacular Mannheim orchestra; when he went to Italy, he encountered the Italian overture and opera buffa, both of which were to be hugely influential on his development. Both in London and Italy, the galant style was all the rage: simple, light music, with a mania for cadencing, an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other chords, symmetrical phrases, and clearly articulated structures. This style, out of which the classical style evolved, was a reaction against the complexity of late Baroque music. Some of Mozart's early symphonies are Italian overtures, with three movements running into each other; many are ""homotonal"" (each movement in the same key, with the slow movement in the parallel minor). Others mimic the works of J.C. Bach, and others show the simple rounded binary forms commonly being written by composers in Vienna. One of the most recognizable features of Mozart's works is a sequence of harmonies or modes that usually leads to a cadence in the dominant or tonic key. This sequence is essentially borrowed from baroque music, especially Bach. But Mozart shifted the sequence so that the cadence ended on the stronger half, i.e., the first beat of the bar. Mozart's understanding of modes such as Phrygian is evident in such passages.

As Mozart matured, he began to incorporate some more features of Baroque styles into his music. For example, the Symphony No. 29 in A Major K. 201 uses a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths. Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had just published his Opus 20 set. The influence of the Sturm und Drang (""Storm and Stress"") period in German literature, with its brief foreshadowing of the Romantic era to come, is evident in some of the music of both composers at that time.

Over the course of his working life, Mozart switched his focus from instrumental music to operas, and back again. He wrote operas in each of the styles current in Europe: opera buffa, such as The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, or Così fan tutte; opera seria, such as Idomeneo; and Singspiel, of which Die Zauberflöte is probably the most famous example by any composer. In his later operas, he developed the use of subtle changes in instrumentation, orchestration, and tone colour to express or highlight psychological or emotional states and dramatic shifts. Here his advances in opera and instrumental composing interacted. His increasingly sophisticated use of the orchestra in the symphonies and concerti served as a resource in his operatic orchestration, and his developing subtlety in using the orchestra to psychological effect in his operas was reflected in his later non-operatic compositions.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Wolfgang+Amadeus+Mozart"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Alanis Morissette,"Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a seven time Grammy Award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter and occasional actress. She is the best-selling female rock artist of all time.

Her international debut album Jagged Little Pill (1995) became one of the most successful albums of all time with total worldwide sales estimated at thirty million copies. Six more studio albums followed – Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998), Under Rug Swept (2002), Feast On Scraps (2002), So-Called Chaos (2004), Flavors Of Entanglement (2008) and Havoc and Bright Lights (2012) . 

Early Life
Alanis Morissette was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to school teachers Alan and Georgia Morissette. Her father is French Canadian and her mother is Hungarian. She has an older brother, Chad, and a twin brother named Wade. Between the ages of three and six they lived with their parents in Lahr (Black Forest), Germany.

Morissette showed a love for singing and songwriting at an early age. When she was 9 years old, Morissette wrote her first song. With the money saved from her stint on the children's television show You Can't Do That On Television, Morissette released an indie single Fate Stay With Me with the B-side Find The Right Man.

In New York City, Morissette landed a spot on Star Search, a popular televised American talent competition with her stage name of Alanis Nadinia. Morissette flew to Los Angeles to appear on the show, but lost after one round.

Alanis and Now Is the Time
In 1990, Morissette signed with MCA Records Canada and released her full-length debut album, Alanis in 1991 with producer Leslie Howe. At the time, Morissette dropped Nadine from her name and was credited simply as ""Alanis"". The dance-pop album, which was only released in Canada, went double platinum and its first single, ""Too Hot"", reached the Top 10 on the Canadian charts. Subsequent singles included ""Feel Your Love"", ""Walk Away"" and ""Plastic"".

In 1992, Morissette was nominated for three Juno Awards: Single of the Year, Best Dance Record, and Most Promising Female Vocalist, the last of which she won. In the same year, she released Now Is the Time, her follow-up to Alanis. The album attempted to move Morissette away from her debut album's dance-pop sound and its lead single was An Emotion Away, with No Apologies, Real World and (Change Is) Never A Waste Of Time being the other three. However, Now Is the Time sold less than half the number of copies of her debut album, and, with her two album deal with MCA Canada complete, Morissette was without a major label recording contract.

Move to Los Angeles
In 1993, Morissette moved from her home town of Ottawa to Toronto. Living alone for the first time in her life, Morissette met with a bevy of songwriters, but the results frustrated her. A visit to Nashville a few months later also proved fruitless. Morissette began making trips to Los Angeles and working with as many musicians as possible, in the hopes of meeting a collaborator. During this time, Morissette met with producer and songwriter Glen Ballard.

According to Ballard, the connection was ""instant"" and within 30 minutes of meeting each other, they had begun experimenting with different sounds in Ballard's home studio. Despite Morissette's naivety, Ballard believed he was dealing with a woman wise beyond her years. Ballard and Morissette penned their first song together called The Bottom Line.

The turning point in their sessions was the song Perfect, which was written and recorded in twenty minutes. Morissette improvised the lyrics on the spot to Ballard's delicate guitar strums. The version of the song that appeared on Jagged Little Pill was the only take the pair had ever recorded.

Ballard and Morissette recorded the songs on Jagged Little Pill literally as they were being written. According to Morissette, Ballard was the first collaborator who had encouraged her to express her emotions completely and fully without any fear of shame or embarrassment. As a result, Morissette unabashedly shared everything, from her buoyant love of life in You Learn, to her warm infatuations in Head Over Feet, to her darkest, most ruthless revenge fantasies in You Oughta Know. Morissette drew inspiration for her lyrics completely from personal experiences. By the spring of 1995, Morissette penned a deal with Maverick Records.

Jagged Little Pill era (1995–1998)
In 1995, at the age of twenty-one, Morissette released her first international album, Jagged Little Pill. Since expectations for the album were low, Morissette's manager and long-time friend Scott Welsh would later admit that he did not expect the album to sell any more than around 250,000 copies. The album debuted at number 118 on the Billboard 200 chart.

However, things changed quickly when a Los Angeles DJ from an influential radio station stumbled onto You Oughta Know and began playing it non-stop. The song instantly garnered attention and a subsequent video went into heavy rotation on MTV. Listeners were shocked, unnerved, and delighted by the song's use of profanity, rare for a female artist at the time. The subject of the song, an ex-boyfriend, became the most guessed about protagonist since ""You're So Vain.""

While ""You Oughta Know"" was a hit, it was the bevy of hit singles that followed that sent Jagged Little Pill to its meteoric rise to the top. Following Hand in My Pocket, the third single, Ironic, went on to become Morissette's biggest hit. She received heavy criticism for the lyrics, however, when it became apparent that many of the situations described by Morissette did not actually qualify as being 'ironic'. Indeed, the Irish comedian Ed Byrne based a significant part of his stand-up act on pointing out the lack of irony in the song. ""You Learn"" and ""Head Over Feet"", the fourth and fifth singles, respectively, kept Jagged Little Pill on the Billboard Top 20 charts for over a year.

Jagged Little Pill was a phenomenal success. It went on to sell 16 million copies in the United States alone, over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the most successful records of all time. Indeed in Ireland just as Under Rug Swept was released in 2002, Jagged Little Pill (6 years after its release) re-entered the album charts on 21 February 2002 at #72 [1] and reached a peak of #19 on 7 March [2]. It took 9 weeks before it departed the charts again on 2 May of that year.

Morissette was dismissed by some as a record industry puppet. She was attacked for collaborating with producer and supposed image-maker Glen Ballard, though Morissette was responsible for all of Pill's lyrics and much of the album's music, and though such a collaboration was not uncommon for many solo artists at the time. Her early albums in Canada also proved a hinderance for her respectability, particularly in her native country.

Despite this setback, the album was nominated for six Grammy Awards. At the 1996 ceremony, Morissette performed a moving rendition of ""You Oughta Know"", one that all but drained the anger from the song, leaving only an air of sorrow and remorse. That night, Morissette won awards for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Album, and the big one, Best Album.

Later that year, Morissette embarked on an eighteen-month world tour in support of Jagged Little Pill, beginning in small clubs and ending in large venues. The DVD Jagged Little Pill, Live chronicled the bulk of this tour.

Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie era (1998–2002)
In 1998, Morissette recorded Uninvited, a song from the soundtrack to the film City of Angels. The track was never officially released as a single (only as a promo one), but nevertheless received widespread radio airplay.

Later that year, Morissette released Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, once again collaborating with Glen Ballard. Fans and critics alike were unprepared for Morissette's new songwriting approach, as most of the songs on the disc, including The Couch and Unsent, challenged traditional song formulas.

Nowdays, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is considered the biggest highlight of Alanis in terms of fans' opinions.

Upon release, the album started selling extremely well. Privately, the label hoped for a million copies upon initial release. It sold about half of that. Nevertheless, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, breaking the record for the most albums sold in a single week by a female artist, with sales at 469,000 copies (eventually eclipsed by Britney Spears's Oops!... I Did It Again album). As a follow-up to Jagged Little Pill, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie had very little staying power. Its wordy, personal lyrics turned many fans off and after only 28 weeks, it left the Billboard 200, selling 2.5 million, a huge drop from Jagged. Worldwide, the album sold about 7 million copies. However, it received positive reviews, including a four-star review from Rolling Stone magazine. In 1999, the song ""Uninvited"" won two Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. The first single, ""Thank U"", was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The video for this song, which featured Morissette in the nude, generated mild controversy. That same year, Morissette released the live acoustic album MTV Unplugged.

In 1999, Alanis Morissette briefly returned to acting, appearing as God in the Kevin Smith film Dogma. Smith, who claimed to be a big fan of Morissette's, asked her to be in the film several times. She had to turn down the female lead and by the time her schedule allowed her to participate in the film, only the role of God, which involves virtually no speech and only an appearance at the very end of the film, was left. She also wrote and produced a song for the movie's soundtrack, that song being Still.

She also appeared on the hit HBO comedies Sex and the City and Curb Your Enthusiasm and starred in the play The Vagina Monologues.

Under Rug Swept era (2002–2004)
Alanis Morissette on stage at the Brazil Music Festival, 2003In 2002, after a four year absence, Alanis Morissette released her third international studio album Under Rug Swept, with the notable absence of Jagged Little Pill and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie collaborator Glen Ballard. For the first time, Morissette took on the role of sole writer and producer.

The album spawned the hit single Hands Clean, while the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 215,000 in the first week. Under Rug Swept would eventually sell close to a million copies in the United States alone, though only ""Hands Clean"" received any substantial radio airplay. The album was overlooked by the Grammy Awards, but Morissette won yet another Juno Award for Producer of the Year.

In December 2002, Morissette released a CD/DVD combination package, Feast on Scraps, which included live concert footage and eight previously unreleased songs from the Under Rug Swept recording sessions. The album was nominated for a Juno Music DVD of the Year award.

In November 2003, Morissette appeared in the off-Broadway play The Exonerated as Sunny Jacobs, a death row inmate freed after proof surfaced that she hadn't committed the crime, a role that she would revisit three years later, in Spring of 2006.

So-Called Chaos era (2004)
May 2004 saw the release of Morissette’s 4th international studio album, So-Called Chaos. While all song writing on the album was credited to Morissette, the album was co-produced with Tim Thorney and John Shanks.

Selling over 115,000 copies in its first week of release, the album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 chart to generally favorable critical reviews. The album’s lead single, an optimistic ballad called Everything, was released in March 2004 and saw some commercial success on adult contemporary radio. In an effort to avoid a censor ""bleep"" in the first line of the song, the radio and music video versions changed the word ""asshole"" to ""nightmare"". The radio and music video version also edited out several verses from the album version. Two other singles, Out Is Through and Eight Easy Steps, soon followed but neither matched the success of ""Everything"". A dance mix of ""Eight Easy Steps"" was a top ten hit on US dance music charts.

In June 2004, Morissette announced her engagement to actor and fellow Canadian, Ryan Reynolds. Morissette expanded her own acting credentials with the July release of the Cole Porter biographical film De-Lovely, in which she performed the song Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love and had a brief acting role as an anonymous stage performer. Her recording of the song was featured on the film's soundtrack and on The Collection.

Jagged Little Pill:Acoustic and The Collection era (2005)
On February 11, 2005, Morissette became a naturalized citizen of the United States while still maintaining her Canadian citizenship. Morissette refers to herself as a Canadian–American.

Also in February 2005 she made a guest appearance on the Canadian television show Degrassi: The Next Generation along with Dogma co-star Jason Mewes and director Kevin Smith.

To commemorate the 10 year anniversary of Jagged Little Pill, Morissette released a studio acoustic version on June 13, 2005 entitled Jagged Little Pill Acoustic. CNN reported that the album would be exclusively released through Starbucks' Hear Music retail concept through their coffee shops for a six-week run, much like Ray Charles's successful album Genius Loves Company. This move caused much controversy, with companies such as HMV in Canada removing their entire Morissette catalog for the duration of the deal in protest. The album sold about 310 000 copies. The album went into wide release to all retail chains the last week of July. This version included enhanced features not included on the Starbuck’s release version. The accompanying Jagged Little Pill: Acoustic tour ran for two months in the summer of 2005, with Morissette playing in small, intimate theatre venues.

On October 14th, Morissette released a cover of the 1991 Seal song Crazy as the first single from her greatest hits album, Alanis Morissette: The Collection. The song reached number 9 on the Billboard Top 40 chart during the week of December 5.

The Collection was released on November 15, 2005, followed by a limited edition version of the album on December 6, 2005. The limited edition features a DVD including a documentary with videos of two unreleased songs from Morissette’s 1996 ""Can’t Not"" Tour: King of Intimation and Can't Not (the latter appeared in a reworked version on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie). The DVD also includes a 90 second clip of the unreleased video for the song ""Joining You"".

Morissette contributed a song entitled Wunderkind to the soundtrack of the film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The song was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song.

Flavors of Entanglement
Morissette's latest studio work, ""Flavors Of Entanglement"" (2008), was released June 2nd internationally and June 10th in the United States. Production of this album was done Guy Sigsworth (Madonna, Frou Frou) and the album is said by Morissette and Sigsworth to have a very different, unique sound and it drifts apart from Morissette's past works. She even included male choruses in one of her songs, something she's never done before.

Morissette said she wrote 25 songs for Flavors, but only 11 of those made the cut. On March 6th, 2008, the final track list was published via her official website:
1. Citizen of the Planet
2. Underneath
3. Straitjacket
4. Versions of Violence
5. Not As We
6. In Praise of the Vulnerable Man
7. Moratorium
8. Torch
9. Giggling Again for No Reason
10. Tapes
11. Incomplete

The other songs will be released in some other manner as Morissette said herself. Some of the other titles are ""On The Tequila"", ""Limbo No More"", ""It's a Bitch To Grow Up"", ""Madness"", ""I Am"", ""Orchid"", ""Wounded Leading Wounded""

Underneath, the lead single from Flavors of Entanglement, was released officially on April 15, 2008 in the United States and a month later in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The single was originally featured at the Elevate Film Festival, a festival of films that encourage environmental activism, on September 15, 2007. The original video featured Morissette and others swimming underwater. An official video was released with the single, featuring contrasts between Alanis' environmental activism and her romantic life, and sending the message that change a person wants to see must start in their heart.

Havoc and Bright Lights
The Guardian Songfacts reports that Guardian, the lead single from Havoc and Bright Lights, was released officially on May 15, 2012.

After leaving drug dealing to pursue a rap career, he released his debut album Guess Who's Back Again in 2002. He was discovered by Eminem and Dr. Dre and then signed to Interscope Records. He has since released Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003), The Massacre (2006), Curtis (2007) and Before I Self Destruct (2009).

50 Cent has engaged in feuds with other rappers including Jay-Z, Ja Rule, The Game, Cam'ron, Fat Joe, and Rick Ross.

Before 50 Cent ever inked a major deal, he built up a substantial fan base in New York through underground mixtapes. 50 Cent met up with Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC and was signed to his label to write all of Jay’s music. After he’d left JMJ, he signed to Columbia Records in 1996. On this label, he released Power of the Dollar, and the singles How to Rob and Ghetto Qua Ran. Columbia Records released him from the label after being shot on May 24th, 2000.

Biffy Clyro,"Biffy Clyro is a three-piece alternative rock band which formed in Kilmarnock, Scotland in 1995. The band consists of Simon Neil (vocals, guitar), James Johnston (bass, vocals) and his twin brother Ben (drums, vocals). The band has released six albums since their formation: ""Blackened Sky"" (2002), ""The Vertigo of Bliss"" (2003), ""Infinity Land"" (2004), ""Puzzle"" (2007), ""Only Revolutions"" (2010) and ""Opposites"" (2013). A seventh album, called ""Ellipsis"" is slated for 2016 and will be released on 8th of July.

Biffy, as they are often referred to, utilise a quiet/loud dynamic, constructing songs that can range from a whisper-quiet pick on the guitar, to huge walls of noise with massive distortion and crashing drums. Their sound has simplified somewhat in recent times yet still occasionally contains complex time signatures and heavy riffs. While Simon Neil sings lead, all three members provide vocals. ""'Mon the Biffy!"" is a well known chant amongst Biffy fans; it is usually shouted in between songs at gigs, or before the band come on stage. Some fans have reacted poorly to the band's recent output. 

The first incarnation of what would eventually become Biffy Clyro was formed in 1995 by fifteen-year-old Irvine-born, Ayr-raised guitarist Simon Neil, who recruited Kilmarnock-born Ben Johnston and someone known only as Barry on drums and bass respectively, calling themselves Screwfish. Barry was soon replaced by James Johnston, Ben's twin brother, and the three spent the next two years rehearsing, writing and covering songs. In 1997, they played their first gig as the support for a band called Pink Kross at a local youth centre. The trio then moved to Glasgow, where Neil went to the University of Glasgow and the Johnston twins went to Stow College, studying Electronics with Music and Audio Engineering respectively.They then progressed onto the bigger stage

After playing gigs around Glasgow and receiving positive and enthusiastic reactions from the audiences, the band were spotted by Dee Bahl, who soon became their manager. Bahl offered them a chance to release an independent single on Aereogramme's Babi Yaga record label. ""Iname"" was released on 28 June 1999, and led to the band being chosen by Stow College's Electric Honey record label to release a record. thekidswhopoptodaywillrocktomorrow... was released on 13 June 2000, and after hearing it, BBC Radio Scotland DJ Vic Galloway gave the band airplay. A few days prior to the release of thekidswho..., the band were spotted at the Unsigned Bands stage at T in the Park 2000 by a Beggars Banquet representative. Soon after, the band was signed to the independent Beggar's Banquet, and on 30 October 2000, they re-recorded and released the single, ""27"", which became Kerrang!'s Single Of The Week.

On 1 October 2001, one of the songs from thekidswho... was re-recorded and released as a single, ""Justboy"". This was repeated on 4 February 2002, when the song ""57"" was released. On 11 March, the band's debut album, Blackened Sky, was released to generally positive reviews. It was around this time that the band began touring extensively, including being the support for Weezer on 20 March at the Barrowlands in Glasgow. On 15 July, the fourth single from the album, ""Joy.Discovery.Invention"" was released as a double A-side with a newly recorded song, entitled ""Toys, Toys, Toys, Choke, Toys, Toys, Toys"", which later appeared on The Vertigo of Bliss.

In 2003, the band retreated to the Linford Manor recording studio in Great Linford, Milton Keynes, England to record the follow-up to Blackened Sky. On 24 March, a new single was released entitled, ""The Ideal Height"", followed by another new single entitled ""Questions and Answers"" on 28 May. The band's second album, The Vertigo of Bliss was released on 16 June, to positive reviews, which focused on the more experimental style of the album in comparison to Blackened Sky, as well as the introduction of string sections.

In 2004, after touring relentlessly for The Vertigo of Bliss, the band retreated to Monnow Valley Studios in Monmouth, Wales to record a follow-up. As with the previous album, two singles were released before the actual album; ""Glitter and Trauma"" and ""My Recovery Injection"" on 9 August and 20 September, respectively. A digital download was also released; ""There's No Such Thing As A Jaggy Snake"", on 31 May. On 4 October, the band's third album, Infinity Land was released, and on 14 February 2005, the last single from the album, ""Only One Word Comes To Mind"" was released. On 16 February, the band performed a cover of Franz Ferdinand's ""Take Me Out"" live from Maida Vale on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show. Simon Neil's side project, Marmaduke Duke, also released an album in 2005, The Magnificent Duke, and toured the UK, along with the Johnston twins accompanying on bass and drums, for it.

In 2006, Biffy Clyro left Beggars Banquet and signed a deal with 14th Floor, an offshoot of Warner Bros. In June, the band contributed a cover of Weezer's ""Buddy Holly"" to Kerrang!'s High Voltage!: A Brief History of Rock, which came free with Issue #1110 of the magazine. In September, the band moved temporarily to Canada to record their fourth album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, and The Farm Studio in Gibsons, which they finished doing in November. The song ""Semi-Mental"" was released as a digital download on 25 December. In 2007, the song ""Saturday Superhouse"" was released on 14 May, where it reached #13 on the UK Singles Chart; the band's highest single chart position to date. On 14 May, the song ""Living is a Problem Because Everything Dies"" was released, reaching #19 on the UK Singles Charts. On 21 May, Biffy were confirmed for T in the Park 2007, as well as being announced as one of the support bands for the 17 June gig at the new Wembley Stadium for Muse. On 1 June, Biffy were confirmed for Glastonbury 2007.

The Avalanches,"There have been at least two bands named The Avalanches:
1. An Australian electronic music collective
2. A defunct American surf rock group
NOTE: The former band actually got their name from the latter, as The Avalanches' "" Ski Surfin''"" album was known to be their favorite album.

1. The Avalanches are an electronic music collective from Melbourne, Australia. They are well known for their use of eclectic sampling, having created their debut album, Since I Left You (2000), entirely out of over 3,500 samples of obscure records, movies, and television shows. This is famously demonstrated on their hit single ""Frontier Psychiatrist"".

Before this, they were a hip-hop group with the single album Rock City and the EPy El Producto.  Currently, The Avalanches are appearing at outdoor festival events with a DJ set, and are reportedly working on new material.

2. The Avalanches was an instrumental surf rock studio group, active in the 1960s, which included Billy Strange, Tommy Tedesco, David Gates (later of Bread) and Hal Blaine. In 1963 they recorded an LP Ski Surfin', which was re-released in 2007. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avalanches"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

TV on the Radio,"TV on the Radio are an American indie rock band formed in 2001 in Brooklyn, New York.

The group has released several EPs including their debut Young Liars (2003), and five studio albums: Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes (2004), Return to Cookie Mountain (2006), Dear Science (2008), Nine Types of Light (2011), and Seeds (2014).

For most of the band's existence, the core TV on the Radio lineup has been Tunde Adebimpe (vocals/loops),  David Andrew Sitek (guitars/keyboards/loops),  Kyp Malone  (vocals/guitars/bass/loops),  Jaleel Bunton  (drums/vocals/loops/guitars) and Gerard Smith  (bass/keyboards) as official members.

The band's Bio from their website:
TV on the Radio gets to do anything. Like a small platoon whose pleasing impenetrability is their core, the band consistently confounds expectations while managing to balance respect from critics and peers alike. The result is TV on the Radio gets to do anything they want. This freedom is their engine.
 
“It’s about doing what feels right,” says singer Tunde Adebimpe. “I really feel like this band is something that is expansive and always changing and growing. If we wear our influences on our sleeve, it’s a pretty crowded sleeve.”
 
It’s no different with Seeds, the new and fifth proper studio album that Adebimpe has made along with Jaleel Bunton, Kyp Malone, and David Andrew Sitek (who also produced it). Having long outlasted that early 2000s fascination with all things Brooklyn to which the hip willfully succumbed, they continue to conquer music on their own terms. This album serves as another step in continuing to heed their reputation as “the most vital, current band in America” (Associated Press).  
 
This go-round the songs are immediate and triumphant, textured with storytelling hooks and possibly the most honest music this band has ever composed. They’ve hit a point where they’re OK being straight-up beautiful without having to manipulate prettiness into whatever unforeseen shape.
 
Slate says Seeds has “TV on the Radio’s best songs in years.  They are sounding sharper than ever.” And the band knows it. Adebimpe has already said this is the band’s best record. Not a boast, just an observation.
 
“I feel like I knew it before we were done,” he says immediately. “I was so excited by the songs while we were making them, I wanted to get more and more and more into it. The general feeling going into it was, 'We're still here. Our friendship with each other is so strong. Being in a band, at its best times, is like being... well, let’s say whenever things are going really well, we're like ‘cool, Voltron's back together.’“
 
The TV on the Radio guys are the type of people who go on hiatus and focus on music. They may take time between albums for their other endeavors, but they know when it’s right to come together – especially when the music comes as easily and passionately as it did with case Seeds. The band found themselves collected in David Sitek’s Los Angeles studio last year and recorded a couple of songs – “Mercy” and “Million Miles” and didn’t want to stop.
 
“Those were just songs that we wrote because we hadn't written songs together in a while,” says Sitek “They came out really fast and inspired us to do it again – and then ‘again’ turned into the record.”
 
Adebimpe and Sitek live in Los Angeles, Bunton and Malone reside in New York, but make no mistake: TV on the Radio is a quartet. To attempt to parse out exactly what each member does in the group would be to dismantle the fundamental essence of what makes TV on the Radio the monolithic anomaly they have been careful to cultivate and protect for more than a decade. They permeate beyond a wall of sound, and instead create a planetarium of music with every song. They embody many voices. Most of them can play just about anything. And sing too. They are equal partners in the creation of a type of noise that appeared seemingly out of nowhere over 10 years ago.
 
Throughout the years, TV on the Radio has been consistent in the standard they set for themselves. Earlier records, Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes and Return To Cookie Mountain stole the hearts of fans and critics alike just the same, winning the Shortlist Music Prize and Spin's Album of the Year respectively. Their breakout release Dear Science was named best album of 2008 by Rolling Stone, The Guardian, Spin Magazine, The New York Times, The Onion AV Club, MTV, even Entertainment Weekly. An embarrassment of riches, really. Their last album, 2011's Nine Types of Light, was deemed ""pure heaven"" by the cherubs at Rolling Stone, and earned the band a Grammy® nomination. The band has also graced the stages of Saturday Night Live and The Colbert Report. 
 
“The band is it’s own ‘self.’ It has to be that way,” Adebimpe says. “That's been the goal for a long time. Nobody really wants to be the focal point for the band; the band should be the focal point. Not even the band: the music. We can show up and take credit for it, but ultimately it's something that maybe we helped shape and facilitate coming into the world. But that’s all.”
 
They happily recruit likeminded associates to help prop up this invention of theirs in the studio and on stage. (Kelis, for instance, appears on “Lazzeray”). The band has recorded and performed with other artists who’ve conquered the music world on their own terms just as much as they have. Fellow mavericks like Trent Reznor, Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs fame, Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy, Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead, Martin Perna of Antibalas, Katrina Ford of Celebration, and David chuffing Bowie have all romped in the sandbox with TV on the Radio.
 
“If you share a material thing, it dissipates,” Adebimpe says, recalling a fragment of philosophy he once heard, or might be improvising on the spot. “If you share a spiritual thing, it just increases. It becomes more and more and more. I'm already thinking about the next record.”
 
Seeds is an expression of everything this band has been through in the last three years and more. They’re influential, in their prime, they’re TV on the Radio, and they’ve proven themselves to be one of the most important bands of this generation. It clicks, as it always does, and TV on the Radio is brand new again, again.
 
 “No matter what you go through individually and collectively, when you step away from each other, you're kind of like, ""I know that if we get together we can fire this thing,"" says Adebimpe. “It's definitely in the spirit of the punk rock we all grew up with. If you win, you're still a punk. If you lose, you're still a punk, and honestly, it's not about anybody else.”

Icona Pop,"Icona Pop are a Swedish duo who were formed in 2009, with electro house, punk and indie pop music influences. The two members, Caroline Hjelt and Aino Jawo, who grew up in Stockholm, Sweden, wanted to create music ""which you can both laugh and cry with at the same time"". They signed to TEN Music Group in 2009.

In late 2010, their song ""Manners"" was featured on Kitsuné Maison Compilation 10. ""Manners"" was later released as their debut single in 2011. It managed to peak at number 15 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. ""Manners"" was followed that year by their debut EP Nights Like This. They released their second EP the year after, titled Iconic EP. The 2012 EP included their hit single ""I Love It"". The song was written by Patrik Berger, Linus Eklöw and Charlotte Aitchison (Charli XCX). The latter was also featured on the song, singing along with Icona Pop during the chorus. The duo's self titled debut album was released later that year. ""I Love It"" went to become one of the biggest hits by a Swedish artist since Roxette, with the song peaking at number 7 on the US Hot 100. 
In 2013, the duo's international debut album was released.
Singles ""We Got The World"" and ""Girlfriend"" did not match up with the success of their predecessor, however the single ""All Night"" managed to get a gold certification in Canada and topped the US Dance chart. The last single from their debut era, ""Just Another Night"", only charted on the US Dance chart.

In 2014 Icona Pop toured heavily. They were opening acts for both Miley Cyrus' Bangerz tour and Katy Perry's Prismatic tour. During the year, they also released a new single, ""Get Lost"". It had more teen pop and country influences compared to their previously EDM inspired music. It did not became as big hit internationally as previous singles, though it became their first single since ""Girlfriend"" to chart on the Swedish singles chart, peaking at number 58 (""Girlfriend"" peaked at number 57). 

The single ""Emergency"" was released during the summer of 2015 and went to become their second biggest hit in their home country: it recieved a platinum certification in Sweden, even though it's peak position on the Swedish chart only was at number 19. Later, an EP was released called Emergency EP, which included the single of the same name and two new tracks. To promote the EP in the US and Canada, the duo were the opening act for One Directions on the North American leg of their On the Road Again tour. 

Icona Pop premiered a new song on the Grammis Awards show called ""Someone Who Can Dance"". Swedish singer Zara Larsson sang the second verse whereas another Swedish artist, Elliphant, sang a new verse after the second chorus. However, the single version of the song excludes the featured artists.

G-Eazy,"G-Eazy has an agenda. For the last couple of years he's been trying to finish school while building up a grassroots fan-base across the US. Schooled in the bay, tested in New Orleans, G isn't a stranger to paying dues. His live shows have turned heads from the smallest of Midwest clubs all the way up to arenas on dates with Lil Wayne, Big Sean, and Drake, among others.

Without label support G has trekked across the US on multiple tours breaking hearts with his James Dean meets hip-hop vibe and unforgettable live shows. It's not hype. It's not a hit. It's not an image. It's all of the above, the product of diligence that only a true fan understands; G reinterprets what he loves, not what everyone wants to hear, but in 2011 its looking like those two paths are starting to merge.

Gʼs been a fixture on the local New Orleans rap scene for a few years and more recently in the music blogosphere, but in the last few months his popularity has surged and as his national profile has grown exponentially. His latest mixtape, The Endless Summer, produced Runaround Sue, who's sun stroked throwback video garnered over 100,000 plays on Youtube in the first week. But it all comes back to the live show, one New Orleans music critic summed it up... “the young crowd was reaching the levels of mass hysteria reserved for the 50s and 60s rock ʻnʼ roll legends to whom G-Eazy has been paying so much homage...”


PRESS

“In a style that is very much his own, G-Eazy's played shows with Girl Talk and
Chiddy Bang, and toured with the likes of megastars Lil' Wayne, Big Sean, and
(juuust right?) Drake.""
-San Francisco Bay Guardian

""He has that je ne sais quoi that makes someone a ""firework.” His interactions with
the crowd were seamless and his actual performance was perfection.""
-Earmilk

""G-Eazy came back from the tour knowing how to format a show, work a crowd, and
develop an instant rapport with the audience.""
–East Bay Express

Nils Frahm,"Nils Frahm (born September 20, 1982) is a critically acclaimed German musician, composer, and producer based in Berlin. He is known for combining classical and electronic music in his compositions, and for an unconventional approach to the piano, in which he mixes a grand piano, upright piano, Rhodes piano, drum machine, and Moog Taurus. He was taught to play the piano by Nahum Brodski, a student of the last protégé of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It was through this training that Nils began to immerse himself in the styles of the classical pianists before him as well as contemporary composers.

Today Nils Frahm works as an accomplished composer and producer from his Berlin-based Durton Studio. His unconventional approach to an age-old instrument, played contemplatively and intimately, has won him many fans around the world. For a musician this early in his career, Frahm displays an incredibly developed sense of control and restraint in his work, catching the ear of many fans. 

As the recognition continues to grow for his previous solo piano works Wintermusik (2009) and The Bells (2009), 2011 saw the release of his critically acclaimed record Felt on London label Erased Tapes. The album was followed by the solo synthesiser EP Juno and Screws (2012) – a birthday gift to his fans he recorded while recovering from a thumb injury. Nils released his follow up to Juno titled Juno Reworked (2013) with guest reworks by Luke Abbott and Clark.

Now Nils returns with his new album Spaces expressing Frahm’s love for experimentation and answering the call from his fans for a record that truly reflects what they have witnessed during his concerts.

The album peaked at number 46 on the UK Official Album Charts.

In Summer 2010 they released their second album, Flaws . A UK tour co-incided with the release of the album which - surprisingly - is an acoustic recording. Venues on the tour reflected this new acoustic orientation, which gained them a number 8 on the album charts.

On November 5th, 2013 ""Carry me"" was released as an advance of their fourth studio album through Island Records. ""Luna"" was the second single to be extracted from the album ""So long, see you tomorrow"" which coveted the band their first UK number 1. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bombay+Bicycle+Club"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Garbage,"Garbage is a Scottish-American alternative rock band formed in 1994 in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. The group members are Shirley Manson (vocals, guitars), Steve Marker (guitars, keyboards), Duke Erikson (guitars, keyboards, bass), and Butch Vig (drums, percussion).  Erikson, Marker and Vig are also producers and remixers (Vig is best known for producing Nirvana's Nevermind).  To date, the band sold over 17 million albums worldwide.

Initially, Garbage was an informal jam session between the three producers held in Marker's basement. Steve Marker saw the music video of ""Suffocate Me"" by Angelfish on MTV, recorded it and showcased it to his band mates. They invited the Scottish vocalist Shirley Manson to join Garbage, she accepted, and soon Angelfish disbanded. According to Vig, Garbage was named before Manson joined the band, after the percussionist Pauli Ryan walked in while Vig was working on a remix for Nine Inch Nails and said it sounded like ""garbage"".

In August 1995, the group released their debut album Garbage, preceded by their first single ""Vow"" in March 1995. This album was an unexpected smash, selling over 5 million copies and reaching double platinum status in the UK (#6), USA (#20), Australia. Also it received great reviews from critics and featured on the book ""1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die."" They released five singles from this album: ""Vow"", ""Only Happy When It Rains"", ""Queer"", ""Stupid Girl"", and ""Milk"". A non-album single entitled ""Subhuman"" was issued on 7 August 1995.

Also it was nominated for Best Song From a Movie at the 1997 MTV Movie Awards.

They spent over an year working on their follow-up album Version 2.0, which was released on May 1998 and hit #1 in the UK and #13 in the US. It was supported by six singles: ""Push It"", ""I Think I'm Paranoid"", ""Special"", ""When I Grow Up"", ""The Trick Is to Keep Breathing"" and ""You Look So Fine"". The music video of ""Push It"" featured state of the art effects and it costs over $400,000 to make. Version 2.0 sold over 5 million copies, almost the same as their debut.

In 1999, they performed the theme song to the James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough. That year, they also contributed the song ""When I Grow Up"" to the Adam Sandler movie Big Daddy. Version 2.0 was nominated at Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album, and ""Special"" was nominated for Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocal and Best Rock Song.

In October 2001, Garbage issued their third and most pop album beautifulgarbage, preceded by the single ""Androgyny"" in September 2001. All four singles released (""Androgyny"", ""Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!)"", ""Breaking Up the Girl"" and ""Shut Your Mouth"") were moderately successful. This album got 6th place at Rolling Stone's Top 10 Albums of The Year. The world tour from October 2001 to November 2002 was affected by Butch's health problems.

The band struggled to remain together and almost split in 2003, before returning with the fourth studio album Bleed Like Me in April 2005, peaking at a career-high #4 in USA. Four singles promoted the album: ""Why Do You Love Me"", ""Sex Is Not the Enemy"", ""Bleed Like Me"", and ""Run Baby Run"". Garbage cut short their 2005 world tour, and announced an indefinite hiatus, but emphasized it was not a break-up. 

In July 2007 the group released a greatest hits album and a DVD entitled Absolute Garbage. The compilation featured a selection of their singles, a new single ""Tell Me Where It Hurts"" (#50 UK), and a remixed version of ""It's All Over But the Crying"" (the limited edition had also a remixes disc). The DVD included most of their music videos and a documentary related to the band.

In 2008 a new track called ""Witness to Your Love"" was issued on a charity compilation in the USA. Shirley Manson recorded a solo album but her label refused to release it considering it to be ""too noir"". In the same year she started to play a regular role on US TV show Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

According to a post from Shirley's Facebook profile, the band returned back to studio in 2010. On 14 May 2012, Garbage released their fifth studio album, Not Your Kind of People.

Capital Cities,"L.A.’s Capital Cities arrive with a little sonic head rush called ‘Safe and Sound’, an easy, breezy, beautiful slice of effervescent electro-pop that even comes complete with a massive ‘trumpets-in-da-club’ bit that absolutely kills it. (Neon Gold) The song has catchy indie stylings and features the beloved vintage Juno-106 keyboard that gives the production such a comforting retro vibe. (Arjan Writes) It's a scorcher bound to make your dance-infused taste buds sizzle. The music swarms with outside-of-the-box tendencies, jam-packed full of life, energy and unusual yet fantastic sounds. (Clixie)

Recording original, high-quality songs is one thing, but the ability to perform them live with passion, energy and a great, unique sound is a completely different beast. Capital Cities have both down to a science. (The Chuckness) They controlled the audience with addictive beats that caused strangers to dance with each other. Everyone sang along throughout the night regardless if they were first-time listeners. (Campus Circle)

In 2008, Ryan Merchant found Sebu Simonian on craigslist in his search for a collaborator. The two formed a composing team, and in 2010, they began producing material for Capital Cities. The band released their debut EP last summer and saw their lead single 'Safe and Sound' climb to #2 on Hype Machine and hit #1 on CMJ's A&R unsigned spin chart.

Capital Cities have played sold-out shows in their hometowns of Los Angeles and San Francisco and embarked on a successful mini tour of the East Coast and Canada last October. In November, after reaching #1 on South American radio, the band flew to Lima, Perú to play in front of 1000 fans. They just headlined the W Hotel New Year's Eve party in San Francisco and are now back in L.A. as 987fm's January Resident Artist.

1)  Heavy / Proto-doom metal band formed 2008 in Sweden. Ghost is the name of a devil worshipping ministry that - in order to spread their unholy gospels and, furthermore, trick mankind into believing that the end is ultimately a good thing - have decided to use the ever so popular rock music medium as a way to achieve their ends.

Standing motionless and anonymous beneath the painted faces, hoods and robes which their sect demand, the six nameless ghouls of Ghost deliver litanies of sexually pulsating heavy rock music and romantic lyrics, that glorify and glamorise the disgusting and sacrilegious, with the simple intention to communicate a message of pure evil via the most effective device they can find - entertainment.

In May 2010 Ghost were contracted to a UK based gramophone company called Rise Above Ltd, who swore an oath stating that they will assist the group in the task of spreading their musical blasphemies through formats such as Compact Discs, Long Playing Vinyl Records and something referred to as Digital Downloading, whatever that is...

The first Long Playing Ghost album ""Opus Eponymous"" will be released in October 2010 and it is understood and agreed that Rise Above Ltd will spend money on magazine advertising, retail marketing and will employ the services of music publicity specialists in order to expose the music of Ghost to the wider public.

Specific attention will be paid to targeting people (research suggests these are most likely to be adolescents) who have a void in their life, perhaps caused by some form of emotional trauma or upset, that can be filled by the music and philosophies of Ghost. In time, these easily manipulated children will come to share the views and goals of the Ghost ministry and can prepare their own plans for the downfall of humanity...""

2)Ghost is an experimental rock group formed in Tokyo, Japan, in 1984.

Core-member Masaki Batoh grew up in Kyoto, Japan where he attended a private school. During this time, he became interested in American and British rock music ranging from Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd to the Velvet Underground and Japanese rock bands such as the Taj Mahal Travellers and the Flower Travellin' Band.

Later, Batoh formed Ghost with a large and often varying lineup. According to reports posted on Allmusic, the group lived a nomadic existence, drifting from ruins of ancient temples to disused subway stations around the Tokyo area.

The band began releasing their work with the albums Ghost and Second Time Around, which were released, respectively, in 1991 and 1992. The American independent label Drag City licensed each of the albums for distribution, and the Los Angeles The Now Sound label picked up two of Batoh's solo albums, released together as well under the title Collected Works. Two albums, Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet and Snuffbox Immanence, were released simultaneously in 1999.

As well as their own work, Ghost have recorded and performed with the ex-Galaxie 500 duo Damon and Naomi. Five years after releasing both Snuffbox Immanence and Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet, Ghost returned with Hypnotic Underworld, and there were some changes in the band. Cellist Hiromichi Sakamoto and percussionist Setsuko Furuya left and were replaced by a rhythm section of Takuyuki Moriya (electric bass guitar, double bass, and cello) and Junzo Tateiwa (drums, tabla, and percussion). In January 2007, Ghost released its latest studio album titled In Stormy Nights.

Blue Öyster Cult,"Blue Öyster Cult is a renowned hard rock band that formed in 1967 in Long Island, New York, United States. The band is led by founding members Eric Bloom (vocals, guitar) and Buck Dharma (guitar, vocals). They are best known for their hit singles ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"" and ""Burnin' for You"", from 1976 and 1981 respectively. 

The members of the band began to come together in the late 60s as a band called Soft White Underbelly in the vicinity of Stony Brook University on Long Island, New York, formed at the prompting of critic Sandy Pearlman. Pearlman was very influential for the band, which included getting them gigs, their first record with Columbia, and using his poetry as the basis of many of their songs such as 1974's ""Astronomy"".

The band changed its name to the Stalk-Forrest Group in 1968. One single was released on Elektra Records under this name in 1969, though over one album of material was actually recorded. The groups' name changed once more, to Blue Oyster Cult, in 1970. The umlaut was added later that year. They became a successful hard rock band during the 70s; unlike many of their colleagues, they are still active today.

They are best known for three songs: their 1976 single ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"" from the album Agents of Fortune (also featured in the cult movie Halloween, and in Stephen King's novel The Stand), ""Godzilla"" (1977) from the album Spectres and their 1981 single ""Burnin' for You"" from the album Fire of Unknown Origin. Their song ""Veteran of the Psychic Wars,"" with lyrics penned by Michael Moorcock, appeared in the soundtrack of the movie Heavy Metal. Two other well-known songs are ""Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll"" (1972) from the album Blue Öyster Cult, and ""Astronomy"" (1974) from Secret Treaties.

The umlaut on the ""O"" in their name started the trend for using the ""heavy metal umlaut"" in band names. It was suggested to Pearlman by rock critic Richard Meltzer. [1] Additionally, some have suggested Pearlman created the term ""Heavy Metal"" via the use of the band's logo - an alchemical symbol for lead, one of the heaviest of metals.

BÖC have had a minor resurgence recently with two new albums, Heaven Forbid and Curse of the Hidden Mirror, with sixteen songs written or co-written by cyberpunk/horror novelist John Shirley.

BÖC also have enjoyed a resurgence of another kind, the result of a Saturday Night Live sketch featuring a VH1 ""Behind the Music"" portrayal of the studio sessions for ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"". The sketch, starring Christopher Walken and various cast members (including Will Ferrell as ""Gene Frenkle""), centered around producer Bruce Dickinson (Walken) constantly pleading with the band that he  needed ""more cowbell"". The sketch became something of an internet phenomenon, and members of the band have acknowledged enjoying a small spike in popularity in the years since its broadcast.

Blue Oyster Cult founding member Allen Lanier passed away in August 2013. Besides his acclaimed work with his group, Lanier also notably played on the 'Give 'em Enough Rope' album released by The Clash and had a romantic relationship with artist Patti Smith for a while.

Faith No More,"Faith No More is an alternative metal group that formed in San Francisco, California, USA in 1979. Their music combines elements of various different genres, including heavy metal, funk, hardcore punk, progressive, electronica, soul, gospel, film scores, soft rock, R&B, hip hop and jazz, among many others.

Faith No More formed in 1979 under the name Sharp Young Men, and later Faith No Man. This early incarnation of the band was fronted Mike ""The Man"" Morris. Roddy Bottum, Mike Bordin, and Billy Gould decided they wanted rid of him, and rather than firing him, all three quit. They changed their name to Faith No More at the suggestion of a friend (as ""The Man"" was no more). After cycling through a few guitarists, the members recruited Jim Martin. A number of singers passed through, including a brief stint by Courtney Love. Chuck Mosley became the full time singer and appeared on their first two records. Their best known song from this era is probably ""We Care a Lot"", which satirized the prevalence of charity-related rock efforts such as Live Aid and ""We Are the World"".

The band gained a reputation for infighting and friction that sometimes went way beyond the limits of ""creative differences."" In a notorious interview in 1987, Mosley claimed that Martin had hit him with a bottle, and there were frequent rumours of physical confrontations between band members. Indeed, in a short history of the band in one issue, the British music newspaper Melody Maker observed that the band's internal relationships had descended into ""pathological hatred"". Bordin in particular seemed to be very much the ""whipping boy"" of the band and the butt of numerous cruel pranks and practical jokes. It is doubtful that the band would have stayed together had they not been successful after their second album, Introduce Yourself.

Mosley was fired in 1988, and replaced with singer Mike Patton. Patton would prove a more versatile singer than the monotone Mosley. At the time, he was singing with his high school band Mr. Bungle (and would continue to do so during his Faith No More years), and dropped out of Humboldt State University to join Faith No More. The group's first record with Patton, The Real Thing, was a major hit, selling over a million copies and earning the group a grammy.

Patton's astonishing vocal range was, arguably, the salvation of Faith No More. Although never formally trained, the young ex-student was able to veer wildly from a deep, operatic bass through to screeching banshee death metal yowls and all the way up to soulful, almost feminine drawling—usually over the space of one album (as opposed to doing it in a single song as in the band Mr. Bungle). For example, the exuberant rap on ""Epic"" and the sleazy jazz vocals of ""Edge Of the World"" (on the 1989 album The Real Thing) are wildly different. This burgeoning singing ability enabled the band to expand and develop far further. Keyboardist Bottum memorably described his new colleague as ""a pair of lungs on legs.""

The Real Thing (or TRT for short) has been described as ""not quite early Brian Eno joins Led Zeppelin and Funkadelic."" The video for ""Epic"", which featured slow motion footage of a fish flopping out of water, received extensive airplay on MTV in the summer of 1990, despite provoking anger from animal rights activists. That same year, Faith No More gave memorable performances at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards (September 6) and on Saturday Night Live (December 1).

Faith No More displayed a distinctly experimental bent on their next album, Angel Dust. One critic writes that the album is ""one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label,"" and another writes that ""'A Small Victory', which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers … reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions.""  Angel Dust featured the singles ""Midlife Crisis"" and ""A Small Victory"", as well as a re-recording of the theme to the film Midnight Cowboy. Later pressings of the album also included their cover of the Commodores classic ""Easy"", which in some parts of the world became the band's biggest hit. Angel Dust, though not as successful as TRT in the U.S., sold 700,000 copies there, and did manage to outsell TRT in many other world charts. In Germany, for example, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 270,000 copies. Along with heavy airplay of ""Easy"" and ""Midlife Crisis"", the album became a bit of a sleeper hit in the U.K., South America, Europe and Australia.

After touring to support Angel Dust in the summer of 1992, (including tours with Metallica and Guns N' Roses), longtime guitarist Jim Martin was fired (although he claims he quit) during the early stages of recording their follow-up, King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime in 1995. He was replaced by Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. However, when the subsequent world tour was about to begin, Spruance jumped ship, leaving the band to recruit their keyboard roadie Dean Menta to handle guitar duties. KFAD/FFAL remains the band's most heavily criticised album, varying in styles and moods from heavy and slow to spasmodic and jazzy. KFAD/FFAL did however sell acceptably in the U.K., Germany and Australia. In the U.S. the album failed to get any sort of attraction or following, slipping out of the charts quickly. Sales (about 1.5 million) were below that of Angel Dust. The band accordingly decided to cut their world tour short by 4 months, deleted the singles ""Gentle Art Of Making Enemies"" and ""Take This Bottle"", and released a 7 x 7-inch box set of singles that included the B-sides and some interviews between the songs. An automobile accident occurred while in Bearsville, New York for the recording of ""King For A Day."" It's been described as rather bad. Mike Patton, Mike Bordin and Trey Spruance were in it, Patton was driving. They lived...Patton doesn't drive any more. Patton comments, ""Well we saw God. We had a really bad car accident. ...We had to look at lot of things in the face...it was nice.""


Album of the Year was released in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries, for example Germany (#2, later going gold) and Australia (#1, going platinum). In an additional 12 countries in Europe, it went either gold or platinum. In the U.S. the reaction was slow for the album; however, just as interest was picking up on their tours and album they called it a day. Singles ""Ashes To Ashes"" and ""Last Cup Of Sorrow"" had minimal success. Electro-tinged ballad ""Stripsearch"" was released as a single in various countries (excluding the U.S. and U.K.). ""She Loves Me Not"" was cancelled as a single which was a little indicator of their imminent break-up.

On April 19th 1998, after 16 years as a band, Faith No More dissolved. Although the break-up went by with limited media attention, many rumors had surfaced as to the reason, some which included infighting, disagreement over the amount of side-projects (since the line-up had consistently changed), collective exhaustion of creative energy and even the band's growing popularity, which had been attributed as a main influence for many nu-metal bands who would ascend to the mainstream at the end of the decade. Despite being extinct for some years, the band still manages to influence and inspire musicians worldwide.

Patton went on to collaborate with John Zorn, and has been active with several other groups, including Tomahawk and Fantômas. Guitarist Jim Martin went on to collaborate with Anand Bhatt. Keyboardist Roddy Bottum formed Imperial Teen, whose sunny pop music seemed very different from Faith No More. Mike Bordin regularly performs as a member of Ozzy Osbourne's band, as well as Black Sabbath and he was also a member of Korn for a tour when their drummer David Silvera had a problem with his wrist. Billy Gould is a member of Brujeria, as well as founder of Kool Arrow Records, and has also overseen the releases of various Faith No More compilations. Jim Martin also now has the 235th largest pumpkin ever measured, and has made guest appearances on various records, including Antipop by Primus, as well as having released a solo album titled Milk and Blood (1996).

Faith No More also gained more publicity when their tracks ""Falling To Pieces"" and ""The Perfect Crime"" were featured in the films Black Hawk Down and Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey respectively.

On the 25th of February 2009 Faith no More announced a reunion tour, to take place in 2009.  The band are set to play a series of European festivals, according to a press  release from frontman Mike Patton. The official press release for their reunion, written by Bill Gould, was released a day later and can be read on FNM.com.

Louis Armstrong,"Louis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 - July 6, 1971) nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, was an American jazz trumpeter and singer from New Orleans, Louisiana.
Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly-recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also skilled at scat singing (vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics).
Renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to ""cross over"", whose skin-color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation during the Little Rock Crisis. His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a black man.

Armstrong was born and brought up in New Orleans, a culturally diverse town with a unique musical mix of creole, ragtime, marching bands, and blues. Although from an early age he was able to play music professionally, he didn't travel far from New Orleans until 1922, when he went to Chicago to join his mentor, King Oliver. Oliver's band played primitive jazz, a hotter style of ragtime, with looser rhythms and more improvisation, and Armstrong's role was mostly backing.  Slow to promote himself, he was eventually persuaded by his wife Lil Hardin to leave Oliver, and In 1924 he went to New York to join the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra.  At the time, there were a few other artists using the rhythmic innovations of the New Orleans style, but none did it with the energy and brilliance of Armstrong, and he quickly became a sensation among New York musicians. Back in Chicago in 1925, he made his first recordings with his own group, Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five, and these became not only popular hits but also models for the first generation of jazz musicians, trumpeters or otherwise. 
  
Other hits followed through the twenties and thirties, as well as troubles: crooked managers, lip injuries, mob entanglements, failed big-band ventures.  As jazz styles changed, though, musical purists never lost any respect for him -- although they were sometimes irritated by his hammy onstage persona. Around the late forties, with the help of a good manager, Armstrong's business affairs finally stablilized, and he began to be seen as an elder statesman of American popular entertainment, appearing in Hollywood films, touring Asia and Europe, and dislodging The Beatles from the number-one position with Hello Dolly"". Today many people may know him as a singer (a good one), but as Miles Davis said: “You can’t play nothing on modern trumpet that doesn’t come from him.""

The 62-year-old Armstrong became the oldest act to top the US charts when ""Hello Dolly"" reached #1 in 1964. Four years later Satchmo also became the oldest artist to record a UK #1, when ""What a Wonderful World"" hit the top spot.

Felix Jaehn,"Felix Jaehn (born in Hamburg, Germany on 28 August 1994) is a German music producer and DJ specialising in deep house. He took violin lessons at age of 5 and began his DJ career at 16. Jaehn lived in London for a year, where he attended a music school at the age of 17.

Returning to Hamburg, he came to prominence in 2015 through his remix of Jamaican artist OMI's song ""Cheerleader"". The single was an international hit for him topping the charts in Germany, Austria, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It charted in the United States reaching number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In April 2015, he released a remix of Rufus and Chaka Khan classic ""Ain't Nobody"" retitled ""Ain't Nobody (Loves Me Better)"" featuring the vocals of Jasmine Thompson (based on an earlier charting version of the song by Thompson).

Honne,"Long-time friends Andy and James (they don’t disclose surnames) are bringing a little romance to East London dance floors as Honne, a duo inspired by classic soul and complex synths. Signed by Super Recordings, the label that launched AlunaGeorge and Bondax, Honne are being upheld as the sound of the new even before their debut single has been officially released.

Drake and Frank Ocean are obvious comparisons to Honne’s lo-fi, synth-heavy soul, but Andy’s voice has the unfinished edges of Bon Iver or James Blake, rather than the crooner smoothness of Bill Withers or D’Angelo. Warm on a Cold Night is a cinematic piece of songwriting that builds from sparse snare drum beats to an infectious, grooving chorus with soaring synths.

Genesis,"At least two artists have used the name ""Genesis"":
1. A British progessive rock band
2. A 60s psychedelic band from Los Angeles, California
For the Colombian band, please see Génesis.

1. Genesis formed in 1967 in Godalming, Surrey, United Kingdom was one of the most popular progressive rock bands in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. During the 1970s, Peter Gabriel was the lead singer until his departure, when drummer Phil Collins stepped up to the mic and replaced him. 

Starting as an amalgam of two bands formed by schoolboys attending Charterhouse School in Godalming, England, the original lineup consisted of Peter Gabriel, Anthony Phillips, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, and Chris Stewart, though Stewart was soon replaced as drummer by John Silver and then John Mayhew.  By the end of 1970, Phillips and Mayhew had left the band, with Collins joining as drummer, and by early 1971, guitarist Steve Hackett had filled the gap left by Phillips.  The lineup of Gabriel, Banks, Hackett, Rutherford, and Collins remained in place until Gabriel's departure in 1975.

During the period of 1970-1975, the band produced some of the most widely-acclaimed albums of the progressive rock era, including ""Nursery Cryme"", ""Foxtrot"" (featuring the side-long epic ""Supper's Ready"") and the seminal album ""Selling England by the Pound"", which generated Genesis' first foray into the charts with ""I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)"". This lineup culminated with the band's magnum opus ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" in 1974. Following the tour promoting the album, frontman Peter Gabriel left the group in mid 1975.

Genesis decided to continue on as a four-piece, producing two albums, ""A Trick of the Tail"" and ""Wind & Wuthering"", which found the band proving to themselves and to the world that they could move on after Gabriel's departure. Collins stepped up to fill the role of lead vocalist after countless auditions for a new singer proved fruitless by the completion of recording for ""A Trick of the Tail"". Hackett quietly departed after the ""Wind & Wuthering"" tour in 1977, feeling that his creative input for the band was being repressed.

In 1978, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford contributed music to a British movie called ""The Shout"" based on a short story by Robert Graves, directed by Jerzy Skomilowski and produced by Jeremy Thomas. (More credits and info here http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078259/combined)

Genesis then became a trio which began to move away from the dying embers of progressive rock. They established themselves as a more commercially-friendly outfit with the release of their 1978 album ""...And Then There Were Three..."", finding their first US hit with the single ""Follow You Follow Me"".

Banks, Rutherford, and Collins became more adept at writing radio-friendly songs in the 1980s. This reached a peak with the release of 1986's ""Invisible Touch"", in which more than half of the album's eight songs made it to the singles chart, including the title track, ""Land of Confusion"" and ""In Too Deep"". All three band members produced solo albums during Genesis' downtime in the 80s and 90s - most notably Collins' increasingly successful solo work, and Rutherford's sideline group ""Mike and the Mechanics"" which found moderate success - with evolving styles reflected both solo and when recording together as Genesis.

Collins left the group in 1996, and was replaced vocally by Ray Wilson, the former lead singer of Scottish band ""Stiltskin"". Israeli born drummer Nir Zidkyahu and ""Spock's Beard"" drummer Nick D'Virgilio stepped in to fill the drumming role. Their 1997 album ""Calling All Stations"" was unable to find worldwide success, and despite scoring a minor U.K. hit with ""Congo"", the group slowly faded out of public consciousness. In 1998, after the ""Calling All Stations"" tour (the US leg of which was cut short due to poor album sales), Wilson was released from the band, and Zidkyahu and D'Virgilio, having never been ""official"" band members, went their separate ways. The band, now down to only Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, took a break from performing and recording.


In 1999 Banks, Rutherford, Collins, Gabriel, and Hackett collaborated to re-record ""The Carpet Crawlers"" for greatest hits compilation ""Turn It on Again: The Hits"".


During the latter part of 2005, rumors spread that the band would reform again in its most famous five-man configuration. Genesis management stated that there were no current plans at that time, and that nothing would change in the following twelve months. Phil Collins then said in a radio interview in April 2006 that the classic Genesis line-up was considering a new live-staging of ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"", but it was not to be. On 7th November 2006, Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford announced they would be doing a twenty-date tour of Europe in the summer of 2007, with a North American tour to follow.

A Live DVD of the final European concert in Rome, where the band performed free for 500,000 fans, was released May 26th 2008: ""When In Rome - Live 2007"".

In April of 2011, Phil Collins, after completing a reunion tour with Genesis, said in a newspaper interview that he has no plans to tour or make another album, effectively retiring after over 40 years in the music business.

2. In 1967-8, there was an American band that was also named Genesis. It was a psychedelic rock group based in Los Angeles which released one album In the Beginning in 1968. The name conflict was known to the record label of UK Genesis, which is why their debut album From Genesis to Revelation coyly omitted the band's name except in the album title. While both bands suffered poor sales for their debuts, the US band broke up in late 1968 not long after one of their members was drafted into the army. This more or less ended any significant confusion except in situations like Last.fm or lazy Googling.

3. A  Colombian group called Génesis also exists.

Wu-Tang Clan,"Wu-Tang Clan  (pronounced /ˈwuːtæŋ/) is a hip-hop group that consists of: RZA, GZA/Genius, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa. They are frequently joined by fellow childhood friend Cappadonna, a quasi member of the group. They were formed in (and are associated with) the New York City borough of Staten Island (referred to by members as ""Shaolin""), though Masta Killa and GZA are from Brooklyn and Inspectah Deck is from the Bronx.They have gone on to become multi-platinum record producers, Grammy winners, TV and film stars, screenwriters, product spokespersons, business owners and, most recently, major motion picture composers. The Clan featured nine MCs until the death of Ol' Dirty Bastard in 2004. One of the most critically and commercially successful hip hop groups of all time, Wu-Tang Clan shot to fame through their uncompromising brand of hardcore rap music. Since their debut, they have introduced or launched the careers of numerous other artists and groups, and already in 1994 there were credited to be over 300 Wu-Tang Clan affiliates, known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees, consisting of rappers, producers, and record label CEOs.

The founders of the Wu-Tang Clan were RZA, GZA, and Ol' Dirty Bastard, who had previously formed the group Force of the Imperial Master (later known as All In Together Now after the release of a popular single by that name). The group attracted the attention of some notable figures in the industry, including Biz Markie, but did not manage to secure a record deal. After the crew dissolved, GZA and RZA (then known as Prince Rakeem) embarked on their solo careers with Cold Chillin' Records and Tommy Boy Records respectively, but to little success. Their frustration with the workings of the hip hop music industry would provide the main inspiration to Wu-Tang Clan's revolutionary business plan. According to The Wu-Tang Manual, at the group's inception, RZA promised the members that if he had total control of the Wu-Tang empire, it would conquer the hip hop world within a dynastic cycle, after which he would relinquish his total control.

Wu-Tang Clan was gradually assembled in late 1992 from friends and accomplices from around Staten Island, New York, with RZA as the de-facto leader and the group's main producer. Two of the cousins, GZA (pronounced Jizza) and RZA (pronounced Rizza), created their new Wu-Tang aliases by mimicking the sound that the words ""genius"" and ""razor"" would make when scratched on a turntable.

""Wu-Tang"" comes from the name of the Taoist holy mountain Wu Dang in northwest Hubei Province in central China; it was also the site of the Ming Dynasty Purple Imperial City built during the reign of the Yongle Emperor in the early 15th century. RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after seeing the kung fu film Shaolin and Wu Tang, which features a school of warriors trained in Wu-Tang style. The group's debut album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang theme, dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu-Tang sections and using dialogue excerpts as skits.

The group have also developed various backronyms for the name (as hip hop pioneers like KRS-One and Big Daddy Kane did with their names), including ""We Usually Take All the Niggas' Garments,"" ""Witty Unpredictable Talent and Natural Game"" and ""Wisdom, Universe, Truth, Allah, Nation, and God"".

Method Man has also mentioned that the ""Wu"" is the sound a sword makes when cutting through the air, and ""Tang"" is the sound it makes against a shield.

The Clan first became known to hip hop fans, and to major record labels, in 1993 (see 1993 in music) following the release of the independent single ""Protect Ya Neck"", which immediately gave the group a sizeable underground following. Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign Wu-Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels, Loud/RCA finally agreed, releasing their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), in late 1993. This album was popular and critically-acclaimed, though it took some time to gain momentum. Though hip hop had long had a gritty texture, the surreal aggression and minimalist production of 36 Chambers nevertheless had a huge impact on the genre, and was to prove massively influential over the next decade. By the beginning of the 21st century, the album had become a regular fixture on ""Best Albums of the 90s"" lists as well as a frequent choice for ""Best Albums of All Time"" lists. The success of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) established the group as a creative and influential force in early 1990s hip hop, allowing GZA, RZA, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa to negotiate solo contracts.

Gavin James,"Gavin James, 22-year-old singer songwriter, has already won Ireland's answer to the Mercury (the Choice Music Prize for 'Song of the Year') and seen his debut EP ('Say Hello') remain on the Irish chart for over 6 months. This rise and development in his home market has gained Gavin sell-out headline dates and wider support tours with the likes of Lianne La Havas, Beth Orton, Kodaline and Marina & The Diamonds. 

A snapshot of this ascent, 'Live at Whelans' is a selection of new and old songs performed in the stripped-back environment of a rapturously-received hometown show. The first track to be lifted from it, 'Nervous', is a pin-drop account of a one-sided relationship: from that initial fear of your first meeting to the gradual realisation, by the end of the song, that perhaps they were never who you thought they were (and it's best to forget about them).

Rudimental,"Rudimental are an east London (UK) music quartet, comprising the songwriters and producers Piers Agget, Kesi Dryden and Amir Amor, together with DJ Locksmith. 

They have stated that they are on a mission to bring back soul into electronic music, and are quoted as saying: “We aren’t just electronic bedroom producers, and we’re not just guitarists and pianists who don’t know much about making a beat”.  They grew up on everything from grime to jazz and blues, from hip-hop to house, and state: “You can’t really box us into a category, we’re more about musicality, songwriting and broader influences. We are Sly and the Family Stone, Todd Edwards and Dr. Dre in a cheeseburger!”

The original Rudimental trio go back a long way. Piers and Locksmith grew up on the same road in Hackney, with Kesi living just around the corner in Stoke Newington, where he went to the same school as Labrinth and Professor Green.  Amir joined the collective in mid-2011 after working with them on some remixes. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rudimental"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Armin van Buuren,"Armin van Buuren is a trance (mostly progressive trance and uplifting trance) music producer and DJ from Netherlands. His musical career started in 1995.

He has been named number one in the prestigious DJ MAG Top 100 poll four times in a row, from 2007 till 2010 and for the 5th time in 2012. He's the first DJ in the history of the DJ Magazine to achieve that and an indication of his prolific output over more than 14 years he’s been dj’ing and producing. Being the official World’s Most Popular DJ is just one of his many achievements, but the driving force behind his success is an overriding passion for electronic dance music.

2008 began with the success that the number one DJ seems to attract; he was awarded with the prestigious Buma Cultuur Pop Award in January. This was followed by being voted as the Best Trance Artist in the Beatport Music Awards in March; judged on the musician’s artistic achievements, national and international success, it is evident that Armin van Buuren has become one of the decade’s most influential trance acts.

Even a basic list of recent successes reads like a lifetime of work: ‘Best Album’ for artist album ‘Shivers’ at both the Dutch Release Dance Awards and the prestigious Edison Awards; ‘Best Compilation’ for ‘A State Of Trance’, in 2006, claiming the ‘Best European DJ’ award in 2007 and ‘Best Mix Radio Show’ at the Miami Winter Music Conference in 2006 and 2007, for radio show ‘A State Of Trance’ – now broadcasting on a massive 40 FM stations as well as satellite and internet radio, with over 26 million listeners a week; a 5th year residency in Ibiza at Amnesia and over 50,000 downloads every week from podcasting high end chart-bothering positions all over the world for singles, albums and compilations , with single “Rush Hour” used as the theme tune to the UEFA European Youth Championship; the #1 entry in the Dutch album charts with his artist album ‘Imagine’, the #1 entry of the DVD registration of ‘Armin Only ‘ Imagine’ – the landmarks just keep coming!

The 350th episode and the 7th year of the hit radio show ‘A State of Trance’ was celebrated in May 2008 with an eight hour live broadcast from Antwerp in Belgium to over 40 radio stations internationally. Fans were invited to a free party with a line up that had been voted for by the show’s listeners; another example of the importance the DJ places on the satisfaction of his fans. Considering the popularity of the radio show the introduction of ‘A State of Trance Podcast’ was a natural progression. The weekly podcasts which contain highlights and Armin’s favourite tracks from the previous episode ensure that trance lovers across the world will never miss another episode!
Sold-out shows for Armin Only in 2005 and 2006 created eager anticipation of the third edition, which kicked off in a sold-out Jaarbeurs in Utrecht in 2008; over 16,000 fans attended and were enthralled by the DJ’s nine hour set. The theme of the night was ‘Imagine’, described by Armin as “the celebration of our sensations both in life and in clubland.” Fans all around the world should not despair, as ‘Armin Only’ tour dates have also been set for Romania, Poland, Belgium and Australia; the DJ will also be touring in England, Scotland, Ibiza, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and the USA, with expected dates in, for an example, the Czech Republic.

Born in Leiden, Holland (on December 25, 1976) to a musical family, Armin indulged his passion for music from a young age. He spent all the money he earned with his paper round on records. His mum won a computer when he was 10, gaining Armin’s interest. “So as a little nerdy kid I was writing my own basic programmes, and learnt about the technology from there.” He progressed from making low-profile mix tapes for friends to higher profile mixes when he discovered experimenting with different sequences on his computer through his uncle. “I was so stunned by what I saw him doing on the computer, that I got addicted to creating music right there and then!”
“I loved dance music immediately – this great rebellious sound that was so different to the ‘beautiful’ songs of the years before”. Armin cites electronic pioneer Jean Michel Jarre as a major influence (famed for his awesome visuals as well as his groundbreaking synth sounds), as well as Dutch producer Ben Liebrand, who later mentored him in his mixing and producing.
In the early days, Armin thought it was wise to have something extra in case the DJ’ing didn’t work out. So he studied for a law degree. The final year of his course was inevitably stretched as he juggled his studies with his increasingly hectic schedule; his rise to fame included lots of productions and remixes, as well as playing out to packed clubs every weekend. It took him three years to graduate, but his determination made him succeed!

Armin’s own productions have all made a huge impact and quickly gain worldwide acclaim; his latest artist album titled ‘Imagine’ entered the Dutch Album Top 100 Chart at number one; this is the first time a dance producer has ever accomplished such a feat in the history of Dutch music. The first single to be taken from this album, ‘Going Wrong’ with DJ Shah featuring Chris Jones, entered the Dutch Singles Chart at number five. The ‘Armin Only DVD’ was also released and reached the acclaimed number one spot in its second week. His back catalogue includes Blue Fear, Communication, Sound of Goodbye, Shivers, Rush Hour, Burned With Desire, Exhale, Love You More, This World Is Watching Me, and Yet Another Day. While the remix offers flood in, Armin only takes on tracks that he really loves. He uses exactly the same criteria for his compilations, meaning that every release from Armin or his long-running Armind label is a bone fide stormer that’s earned its place. His output includes tracks for the cult TV series 24, and the likes of Motorcycle’s As The Rush Comes.
Armin is a dedicated trance lover, but isn’t imprisoned by a single genre, saying “What makes trance work so well is that it doesn’t stick to one style, and can incorporate electro, minimal, whatever it likes.” His desire to showcase more of the great music he hears, along with the number of people sending him tracks they wanted to release, led to the obvious step of starting his own label, Armada, in 2003.

The label is a joint venture between Armin, Maykel Piron (former head of A&R for Warner Music) and David Lewis, who'd previously managed Armin. ""What we wanted was a company that could offer everything for an artist: representation, a booking agency, and a record company. Artists can choose full management, or to just release a record or play out at gigs. Armada lets the artists choose what they want without telling them what to do"".
Armin is now a fully-fledged artist in his own right, having made his songwriting debut on his album, the award-winning Shivers; The events continue to get bigger and bigger, and Armin regularly headlines the likes of Sensation White, Global Gathering, Dance Valley, ZoukOut, Mysteryland, Coachella, Beats In Brazil, Trance Energy, Fort Dance, Summer Days – basically whether you’re in Australia, Russia, the Middle East, the US or Europe, you can catch Armin van Buuren at a club or festival near you!
""This is just what I really want,"" says Armin. ""It’s not just love for music, it’s my passion. It goes beyond liking, and beyond a hobby, it’s about a way of living. Music is essential to my life”.

Ke$ha,"Kesha Rose Sebert (born March 1, 1987 in Los Angeles, United States), better known mononymously as Kesha (stylized as Ke$ha or K$), is an American recording artist. An active singer since before 2005, her breakthrough came in early 2009 after appearing on Flo Rida's number one single Right Round. Ke$ha later supported Calvin Harris on tour in the UK and toured with Mickey Avalon in the US. She also performed at Madison Square Garden on December 11, 2009 for the Z100 Jingle Ball. She was announced as one of the acts for the 2010 revival of Lilith Fair and presented at the 52nd Grammy Awards.

Her debut album, entitled Animal, was released on January 5, 2010 in the US to mixed reviews from music critics. The album sold 152,000 copies in its first week in the US, debuting at number one. Animal was seven years in the making and resulted in Ke$ha's accumulating over two hundred songs by the time of its release, with fourteen making the final cut. A number one placing in New Zealand for the first single TiK ToK (first released on August 7, 2009) gave Ke$ha her first solo number one; this was followed by number one positions in Canada, Australia, Norway and the United States, reaching the top of the Billboard Hot 100 as the first number one of the 2010 decade. During its second week at number one on the chart, TiK ToK set the female download record and became the second best-selling single in a week, after Right Round, for shifting over 610,000 copies. During its fifth week at the top of the chart, it broke the record for the highest weekly plays on the radio airplay chart. Her second single, Blah Blah Blah (feat. 3OH!3), was first released on February 19, 2010 and has since charted within the top 10 in four different countries.

Ke$ha released her second album, Warrior, on November 30, 2012. The album features a collaboration with Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips. 

On October 7, 2013, Ke$ha and Pitbull released a collaboration, Timber, which was became Ke$ha's third number-one.

The Kills,"The Kills are an alternative rock duo formed by American vocalist Alison ""VV"" Mosshart and British guitarist Jamie ""Hotel"" Hince that rose to public recognition at the dawn of the hype surrounding the genre's explosion of the early 2000s. Mosshart had been in the Florida punk band Discount and Hince in British rock band Scarfo. When these groups disbanded, the duo, who first met when Mosshart heard Hince practicing in the hotel room above hers, struck up a songwriting partnership. For months, the pair air mailed work tapes across the Atlantic; after this proved to test the patience of both artists, as it took days or weeks to get each others tapes, Mosshart upped sticks from her Florida home to fly to London.

Wanting to cut themselves off from their pasts, Mosshart and Hince considered their new project to be Year Zero in their careers, so they renamed themselves ""VV"" and ""Hotel"" respectively and began writing sparse, minimalist songs together with the aid of a drum machine. In 2001 they showcased their new songs on a well received demo tape. In true punk rock fashion, however, the pair shunned approaches from major record labels. Recording as VV and Hotel, they contributed the song ""Restaurant Blouse"" to the compilation If the Twenty-First Century Did Not Exist, It Would Be Necessary to Invent It. Shortly after this they recorded their debut release, the Black Rooster EP, which saw release on British indie label Domino Records and was picked up for distribution by Dim Mak Records in the United States.

Following international touring, they entered Toe Rag studios to record their debut album Keep on Your Mean Side, mostly on 8-track, in just 2 weeks.

Their second album, No Wow, was released by Domino records on February 21, 2005. Featuring an artier, less guitar rock sound, the record embraced New Wave and post punk influences and sounded even more stripped down than Keep on Your Mean Side. The first single, The Good Ones, was released on February 7, 2005 and reached number 23 in the UK singles charts. 

VV sang the song Meds on Placebo's 2006 eponymous album.

Jon Hopkins,"Jon Hopkins is a London-based electronic composer, producer and remixer. He makes powerfully emotive, instrumental music that consistently crosses genres, ranging from solo acoustic piano to explosive, bass-heavy electro. A long-term collaborator of Brian Eno, his career has remained unpredictable, taking in collaborations with Wayne MacGregor, King Creosote and David Holmes; remixes for such varied artists as Wild Beasts, Nosaj Thing, James Yorkston, Four Tet and David Lynch; and film scores for directors including Peter Jackson and Gareth Edwards. His hyper-energetic live show has been seen at some of the world's most iconic venues, including Sydney Opera House with Brian Eno, Madison Square Garden opening for Coldplay, and innumerable clubs, festivals and concert halls the world over.

A childhood musical prodigy, he studied classical piano at the Royal College of Music from the age of 12. Exposure to the melodic side of electronica and rave via such artists as Acen, Seefeel and Plaid proved eye-opening, and aged 17 he decided to concentrate on exploring more contemporary sounds. He was hired to play keyboards and samplers for Imogen Heap, then after a year of touring, began to write solo music. His first two albums on Just Music, 2001’s Opalescent and 2004’s Contact Note, gained him critical recognition and a small but loyal following.
  
After an introduction from guitarist and friend Leo Abrahams, he started working with Brian Eno on his Another Day On Earth album. Continuing this break from solo work, he produced King Creosote’s Bombshell, starting a working relationship with the Fence Collective that continues to this day. He also co-wrote tracks with David Holmes for his Holy Pictures album, remixed for James Yorkston and released further Fence collaborations. In 2007 he was introduced to Coldplay by Eno, which led to an additional production credit on Viva La Vida, opening slots for the band on tour, and the inclusion of his track ""Light Through The Veins"" as both intro and outro for the album.

In 2008 he was commissioned by choreographer Wayne McGregor to compose the score for Entity, a contemporary dance production that premiered at Sadler’s Wells to widespread critical acclaim. This music formed the basis for his third solo album, and his first for Domino, Insides. 

Insides had a far greater impact. He developed an intensely dynamic live show to bring the album to life, which resulted in club and festival shows all over Europe and America. In 2009, supporting slots with The xx, Royksopp and Four Tet helped the album gain further momentum, and it reached no. 2 in the electronic charts on US iTunes. After finding his feet in the live arena he joined Eno, Abrahams, The Necks and Underworld’s Karl Hyde for the 'Pure Scenius' series of improvised concerts, at Sydney Opera House. At the same time he collaborated with Tunng on the EP Seven Gulps of Air, a commission from designer Christopher Kelly that was presented at London Fashion Week.

He worked with Eno again on the Lovely Bones soundtrack, a project which led to his first solo score - 2010's Monsters. A haunting indie sci-fi road trip by first-time director Gareth Edwards, Hopkins' electro-acoustic score is built around processed string performances by legendary arranger Davide Rossi. 2010 also saw him release remixes of tracks by Wild Beasts, Nosaj Thing, Imogen Heap, David Lynch and Four Tet, the latter returning the favour on Hopkins’ latest 12-inch, Vessel, which was backed by a Nathan Fake remix of ""Wire"".

Hopkins, Abrahams and Eno teamed up most recently for Eno's Warp Records debut, Small Craft On A Milk Sea, an album of fifteen dark and dreamlike instrumentals born out of a two-week period of improvisation. Released in November 2010, the album has already been hailed as one of Eno's finest collaborations.

He is currently working on a new solo electronic album, to be released on Domino in 2011. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Hopkins"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
London Grammar,"Singer Hannah Reid and guitarist Dan Rothman met in the dorms of Nottingham University where they began writing music together in 2009. They later added multi-instrumentalist Dot Major to complete the London Grammar line-up. 

Their popularity rose with the 2012 release of ""Hey Now"" which they uploaded to the internet and instantly found an online cult following. Their self-released 2013 debut EP ""Metal & Dust"" reached the Top 5 of the iTunes chart. The same year they signed to Ministry of Sound and the single ""Wasting My Young Years"" appeared as the first release on the label. 2013 also saw them play a sold-out show at the Islington Assembly Hall and make an appearance at the Great Escape Festival in Brighton.

A Tribe Called Quest,"A Tribe Called Quest was an influential hip hop group of the 1990s, originally formed in Queens, New York City in 1985. The group is composed of Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, and DJ Ali Shaheed Muhammad. A fourth member, Jarobi White, was an intermittent collaborator appearing on their first album, but he left the group soon after, although he is mentioned as a 'sometimes' member on their third album liner notes. Along with De La Soul and Jungle Brothers, the group was a central part of the Native Tongues Posse, and enjoyed the most commercial success out of all the groups to emerge from that collective.

Q-Tip and Phife had grown up together in Queens, and met Muhammad in high school. The group's name was coined by The Jungle Brothers, whose members attended the same school. Soon after, the group began performing live and recording on a local label. The group became a part of the Native Tongues family, a Hip-Hop artist collective also consisting of the groups Jungle Brothers, De La Soul and Black Sheep.

At the time of their inception, A Tribe Called Quest was unique within the hip-hop community for eschewing gangsta rap and macho posturing. Their lyrics focused on abstract and social issues such as the word ""nigger"", date rape and consumerism. Musically, the group helped pioneer the jazz-rap style (along with groups such as Gang Starr and De La Soul). They made their studio debut in 1990 with People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm. Though this album was critically acclaimed and lead to a strong fan following, their next album, The Low End Theory (1991) was a massive artistic success, appearing on several best of the year lists. It is considered one of the most important hip-hop albums to date. The Low End Theory was followed by the equally strong Midnight Marauders (1993), while Beats, Rhymes and Life (1996) and The Love Movement (1998) did not meet with as much success.

Following The Love Movement, the group disbanded in 1998. Q-Tip and Phife Dawg went on to pursue solo careers while Muhammad co-founded the R&B group Lucy Pearl.

Recently, there have been rumors of a reunion between the trio, ignited by a spate of group concert apperances around the US, one of  their recent appearances was at Bumbershoot, a three-day music festival in Seattle in 2006 and there has been little news of an upcoming album, leading some to believe that the rumors may be unfounded. Since then, the group have been touring on average every other year with the original four man lineup. Q-Tip stated that their last performances as a group took place during Kanye West's 2013 The Yeezus Tour.

Kylie Minogue,"Kylie Minogue (born May 28, 1968, in Melbourne, Australia) is an Australian pop singer who rose to fame after starring in the Australian TV soap Neighbours. Whilst her cover of The Loco-Motion in 1987 reached the Australian #1 spot, it was the Stock Aitken Waterman 'hit factory' which produced her first UK chart-topper, I Should Be So Lucky, in 1988. Throughout the late 1980s, Minogue was a phenomenon in both Australia and the UK, and also saw success in Asia and Europe.

Minogue went on to have the most number of consecutive UK top ten hits of any new artist. However, she left Stock Aitken Waterman and PWL Studios in 1992 and signed with Deconstruction (through BMG). Her next single, ""Confide in Me"", reached number one in Australia and was a hit in several European countries in 1994, and a duet with Nick Cave, ""Where the Wild Roses Grow"", brought Minogue a greater degree of artistic credibility. Drawing inspiration from a range of musical styles and artists, Minogue took creative control over the songwriting for her next album, Impossible Princess (1997). Parting ways with Deconstruction, she spent a short time in the musical wilderness before pulling on a pair of gold hotpants and returning to her pop roots with the #1 hit Spinning Around.  Her music videos showed a more sexually provocative and flirtatious personality and several hit singles followed.

Minogue's biggest hit to date is Can't Get You Out Of My Head, from the globally successful album Fever. It reached #1 in 40 countries, including the US, a market in which Minogue had previously received little recognition and has sold over ten million copies worldwide. She has become one of the most successful female recording artists in the world with #1 hits spanning three decades, and is considered a national treasure in both the UK and her native Australia.

In 2005, midway through her Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour, Minogue was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, causing her to halt the Australian leg of her tour. The news shocked both fans and non-fans alike, and the 'Kylie effect' was felt by breast cancer charities - both in terms of donations and the upsurge of queries from concerned women of all ages. Through her personal suffering, Minogue had inadvertently increased global awareness of breast cancer issues. After successfully coming through a tough twelve-month battle with the disease, in early July 2006 Minogue announced rescheduled dates of her now renamed Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour - fulfilling her Australian dates with a concert on November 11, 2006 in Sydney, along with extra dates, taking the updated show back to London and Manchester in January 2007.

Although now more prominent in music, Minogue makes an occasional return to acting - her most recent project being her well-publicized appearance alongside David Tennant in the Doctor Who Christmas 2007 episode, ""Voyage Of The Damned"".

On November 12, 2007 Minogue released the single 2 Hearts which reached #4 in the UK chart, and which also peaked at #1 in Australia. The album it was from, X, earned her a BRIT Award nomination for Best International Album. The album saw her collaborate with many writers and producers including the Freemasons and Calvin Harris. The following year, Minogue won the Best International Female Solo Artist award at the 2008 BRIT Awards, and in May also received the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, France's highest cultural honor.

On December 1, 2008, Coldplay released ""Lhuna"", a collaborative project with Minogue, at the launch of the (RED)WIRE™ website to mark World AIDS Day 2008. This would be the world premiere of the song.

Minogue's tenth studio album, X, received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album of 2009. It was her fifth Grammy Award nomination.

In 2010,Minogue released her 11th studio album titled Aphrodite,preceeded by the hit single All the Lovers,one of her most succesful singles to date.With Aphrodite,Minogue became the first female artist ever to have #1 albums on the UK charts for 4 consecutive decades.In 2011,she embarked on the Les Folies Tour,which travelled to 5 continents,and was seen by over 600,000 fans worldwide. Minogue made history in the United States for having two songs inside the top three on any U.S. Billboard chart, with her songs ""Better Than Today"" and ""Higher"" charting at one and three on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs.

Minogue is celebrating her 25th anniversary in the music industry in 2012. Timebomb was released by Minogue as a single to coincide with the celebration of the singer’s quarter century in the music business. The Timebomb Songfacts reports that the song was dropped on May 25, 2012, two months short of twenty-five years after her debut single, a cover of little Eva’s The Locomotion. 

Minogue also released the compilation album, The Abbey Road Sessions in October 2012. The album contained reworked and orchestral versions of her previous songs. It was recorded at London's Abbey Road Studios and was produced by Steve Anderson and Colin Elliot. The album received favourable reviews from music critics and it debuted at number-two in the United Kingdom. The album spawned two singles, ""Flower"" and ""On a Night Like This"".

Minogue also starred in two films; a cameo appearance in the American independent film Jack & Diane and a lead role in the French film Holy Motors. Jack & Diane opened at the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival on 20 April 2012, while Holy Motors opened at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. 

In January 2013, Minogue and her manager Terry Blamey, whom she had worked with since the start of her musical beginnings, parted ways. The following month, she was signed to Roc Nation for a management deal. Minogue is currently recording on her twelfth studio album since the spring of 2012. The upcoming album is reported to feature works from producers such as Fernando Garibay, Pharrell Williams, Darkchild, Sia, Nervo and Jay-Z.

In September, she was featured on Italian singer-songwriter Laura Pausini's single ""Limpido"", which was a number-one hit in Italy and has received a nomination for ""World's Best Song"" at the 2013 World Music Awards. In the same month, she joined as a coach in the third series of BBC One's talent competition The Voice UK for one season, alongside record producer and Black Eyed Peas member, will.i.am, Kaiser Chiefs' lead singer Ricky Wilson and pop singer Sir Tom Jones. Minogue's first episode on the show as a judge aired on 11 January 2014. In November, she was hired as one of the new coaches for the third season of The Voice Australia.

In March 2014, Minogue released her 12th studio album, Kiss Me Once. The album featured contributions from Sia Furler, Mike Del Rio, Cutfather, Pharell Williams, MNEK and Ariel Rechtshaid. It peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the United Kingdom. The singles from the album, ""Into the Blue"" and ""I Was Gonna Cancel"", did not chart inside the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 12 and number 59.

In September 2014, Minogue will embark on the Kiss Me Once Tour. She is also set to appear in the upcoming 2015 disaster film, San Andreas alongside Dwayne Johnson. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ray Charles,"Ray Charles (Ray Charles Robinson,  Albany, Georgia, September 23, 1930 - Beverly Hills, California, June 10, 2004), was an American singer-songwriter, musician, arranger, and band leader. 

As a rock and roll, rhythm & blues, soul, blues, jazz, country and pop musician he helped to shape the sound of rhythm & blues.

He brought a soulful sound to everything from country music (""I Can't Stop Loving You"") to rock and roll (""Mess Around""), to pop standards to a now-iconic rendition of ""America the Beautiful."" Frank Sinatra called him ""the only genius in the business.""

Ray Charles was born in Albany, Georgia on September 23, 1930. He was the son of Aretha Williams, a share cropper, and Bailey Robinson, a railroad repair man, mechanic and handyman. The two were never married. The family moved to Greenville, Florida, when Ray was an infant. Bailey had three more families, leaving Aretha to raise the family on her own.

Ray Charles was not born blind. He started to lose his sight somewhere at the age of five. He was rendered totally blind by the age of seven. Charles never knew exactly why he lost his sight, though there are sources that suggest his blindness was due to glaucoma, and some other sources suggest that Ray began to lose his sight from an infection caused by soapy water to his eyes which was left untreated. He attended school at the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine, Florida from 1937-1945 where he developed his musical gift that he is known and remembered for today. His father died when he was ten, followed by his mother five years later.

In school, he was taught only classical music, but he wanted to play what he heard on the radio, jazz and blues. After his mother died, Charles did not return to school. He lived in Jacksonville with a couple who were friends of his mother. For over a year, he played the piano for bands at the Ritz Theatre in LaVilla, earning $4 a night. Charles moved to Orlando, then Tampa, where he played ""with a hillbilly band called The Florida Playboys."" This is where Charles began his reputation of always wearing sunglasses that were made by designer Billy Stickles.

Charles had always played for other people, but he wanted a band that was his own. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, but Chicago and New York City were too big. He moved to Seattle in 1947 and soon started recording, first for the label Swing Time Records, achieving his first hit with the 1949 ""Confession Blues"". The song soared to #2 on the R&B charts. He followed his first recording with his only other hit with Swingtime, ""Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand"" in 1951. It hit #5 on the R&B charts. He then signed with Ahmet Ertegün at Atlantic Records a year later. When he entered show business, his name was shortened to Ray Charles to avoid confusion with boxer Sugar Ray Robinson.

Breakthrough period with Atlantic Records
Almost immediately after signing with Atlantic, Charles scored his first hit singles with the label with ""It Should Have Been Me"" and the Ertegün-composed ""Mess Around"", both making the charts in 1953. But it was Charles' ""I Got A Woman"" (composed with band mate Renald Richard) that brought the musician to national prominence.

The song reached the top of Billboard's R&B singles chart in 1955 and from there until 1959, Charles would have a series of R&B chart-toppers including ""This Little Girl of Mine"", ""Lonely Avenue"", ""Mary Ann"", ""Drown in My Own Tears"" and ""The Night Time (Is the Right Time)"", which were compiled on his Atlantic releases Hallelujah, I Love Her So, Yes Indeed!, and The Genius Sings the Blues. Charles was often cited for using his voice like a saxophone, most notably by the prominent critic Victor Bollo. During this time of transition, he recruited a young girl group from Philadelphia named The Cookies as his background singing group, recording with them in New York and changing their name to the Raelettes in the process.

Crossover success
In 1959, Charles crossed over to top 40 radio with the release of his impromptu blues number, ""What'd I Say"", which was initially conceived while Charles was in concert. The song would reach number 1 on the R&B list and would become Charles' first top ten single on the pop charts, peaking at number 6. Charles would also record The Genius of Ray Charles, before leaving Atlantic for a more lucrative deal with ABC Records in 1959.

Hit songs such as ""Georgia On My Mind"" (US #1), ""Hit the Road Jack"" (US #1) and ""Unchain My Heart"" (US #9) helped him transition to pop success and his landmark 1962 album, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music and its sequel Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2, helped to bring country into the mainstream of music. He also had major pop hits in 1963 with ""Busted"" (US #4) and ""Take These Chains From My Heart"" (US #8), and also scoring a Top 20 hit four years later, in 1967, with ""Here We Go Again"" (US #15) (which would later be duetted with Norah Jones in 2004).

Later years
In 1965, Charles was arrested for possession of heroin, a drug to which he had been addicted for nearly 20 years. It was his third arrest for the offence, but he avoided jail time after kicking the habit in a clinic in Los Angeles. He spent a year on parole in 1966, when his single ""Crying Time"" reached #6 on the charts.

During the late 1960s and into the 1970s, Charles' releases were hit-or-miss, with some big hits and critically acclaimed work. His version of ""Georgia On My Mind"" was proclaimed the state song of Georgia on April 24, 1979, with Charles performing it on the floor of the state legislature. He also had success with his unique version of ""America the Beautiful.""

In November 1977 Charles appeared as the host of NBC's Saturday Night Live. In the 1980s a number of other events increased Charles' recognition among young audiences. He made a cameo appearance in the popular 1980 film The Blues Brothers. In 1985, ""The Right Time"" was featured in the episode ""Happy Anniversary"" of The Cosby Show on NBC. The next year in 1986, he sang America The Beautiful at Wrestlemania 2. In a Pepsi Cola commercial of the early 1990s, Charles popularized the catchphrase ""You Got the Right One, Baby!"" plus he helped in the song ""We Are the World"" a touching song for USA for Africa.

Despite his support of Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1960s and his support for the American Civil Rights Movement, Charles courted controversy when he toured South Africa in 1981, during an international boycott of the country because of its apartheid policy.

Charles recorded a cover version of the Japanese band Southern All Stars' song ""Itoshi no Ellie"" as ""Ellie My Love"" for a Suntory TV advertisement, reaching #3 on Japan's Oricon chart. Eventually, it sold more than 400,000 copies, and became that year's best-selling single performed by a Western artist for the Japanese music market.

Besides winning 17 Grammy Awards in his career (include five posthumous ones), Charles was also honored in many other ways. In 1979, he was one of the first honorees of the Georgia State Music Hall of Fame being recognized for being a musician born in the state. Ray's version of ""Georgia On My Mind"" was made into the official state song for Georgia. In 1981, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was one of the first inductees to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural ceremony in 1986. He received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1986. In 1987, he was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1991, he was inducted to the Rhythm & Blues Foundation. In 1998 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize together with Ravi Shankar in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2004 he was inducted to the Jazz Hall of Fame, and inducted to the National Black Sports & Entertainment Hall of Fame. Also in 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked him #10 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

The Grammy Awards of 2005 were dedicated to Charles.

On December 7, 2007, Ray Charles Plaza was opened in Albany, Georgia, with a revolving, lighted bronze sculpture of Charles seated at a piano.

On December 26, 2007, Ray Charles was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.

Ray Charles Post Office Building
In 2005, the U.S. postal facility located at 4960 W. Washington Blvd., in Los Angeles, California, was designated  the Ray Charles Post Office Building. 
On August 24, 2005, the United States Congress honored Charles by dedicating and renaming the former West Adams Station post office in Los Angeles the ""Ray Charles Station"".

Charles has also appeared at two Presidential inaugurations in his lifetime. In 1985, he performed for Ronald Reagan's second inauguration, and in 1993 performed for Bill Clinton's first inauguration.

In the late '80s and early '90s, Charles made appearances on The Super Dave Osbourne Show, where he performed and appeared in a few vignettes where he was somehow driving a car, often as Super Dave's chauffeur. At the height of his newfound fame in the early nineties, Charles did guest vocals for quite a few projects. He also appeared (with Chaka Khan) on long time friend Quincy Jones' hit ""I'll Be Good to You"" in 1990, from Jones' album Back on the Block.

Following Jim Henson's death in 1990, Ray Charles appeared in the one-hour CBS tribute, The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson. He gave a short speech about the deceased, stating that Henson ""took a simple song and a piece of felt and turned it into a moment of great power"". Charles was referring to the song ""It's Not Easy Being Green"", which Charles later performed with the rest of the Muppet cast in a tribute to Henson's legacy.

During the sixth season of Designing Women, Ray Charles vocally performed ""Georgia On My Mind"", rather than the song being rendered by other musicians without lyrics as in the previous five seasons

During his life he received eight honorary doctorates, the last from Dillard University in New Orleans in 2003. Later that same year, he performed his 10,000th career concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles.

Charles finalized ""Genius Loves Company"" a duets album in 2004, which posthumously became the best selling album of his career. Norah Jones, B.B. King, Willie Nelson, Michael McDonald, Bonnie Raitt, Gladys Knight, Johnny Mathis and James Taylor are just a few of the notable artists involved with the project.

Charles was awarded the prestigious ""President's Merit Award"" from the Grammy(r) organization and was named a City of Los Angeles ""Cultural Treasure"" by LA Mayor James Hahn during ""African American Heritage Month"" in a ceremony that he attended. He also received the NAACP Image Awards' ""Hall of Fame Award.""

Charles died in July 2004 in California. Three months later, his biopic ""Ray"" opened in theaters. The performance of Jamie Foxx as Ray gave him an Oscar for best lead performance in a feature film.

Recently, a series of slot machines were designed in Charles' name for the visually handicapped and the legendary performer was also named a ""living legend"" by the Library of Congress.

Charles once told an interviewer from USA Today, ""Music to me is just like breathing. I have to have it. It's part of me."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Animal Collective,"Animal Collective is a musical group which formed in Baltimore, Maryland, United States in 1999. The band consists of Panda Bear (Noah Lennox), Avey Tare (David Portner), Deakin (Josh Dibb) and Geologist (Brian Weitz). Records released under the name Animal Collective may include contributions from any or all of these members; the lineup is not uniform. 

The band has released ten albums: ""Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished"" (2000), ""Danse Manatee"" (2001), ""Campfire Songs"" (2003), ""Here Comes the Indian"" (2003), ""Sung Tongs"" (2004), ""Feels"" (2005), ""Strawberry Jam"" (2007), ""Merriweather Post Pavilion"" (2009), ""Centipede Hz"" (2012) and ""Painting With"" (2016).

The band members met in school and started recording together in various forms of collaboration from a young age. Although the band is often classified as psych folk or noise rock, it is hard to define the Animal Collective sound as they often experiment with diverse styles and ideas from album to album. The group also runs the record label Paw Tracks on which they have released their own material as well as material by artists such as Ariel Pink, Terrestrial Tones, and The Peppermints.

Fatboy Slim,"Fatboy Slim is a pseudonym of Quentin Leo Cook (b. 31 Jul 1963 in Reigate, Surrey - aka Norman Cook), an English big beat musician.

Quentin Leo Cook was educated at Reigate Grammar School. He started a punk fanzine titled Peroxide with his neighbour Andrew Thomas and art student Ian McKay (formerly Laidlaw). Contemporary with his publishing activities, he played drums in Disque Attack (a British new-wave-influenced rock band) for which he later performed lead vocals. At Reigate College he also met Paul Heaton and, at 18, he went to the Brighton Polytechnic to study a BA in English, Politics and Sociology. Although he had begun DJing some years before, it was at this time that he began to develop his skills on the thriving Brighton club scene.

In 1985 Cook's friend Paul Heaton who lived in Hull had formed a guitar band called The Housemartins. The Housemartins' bassist had just quit on the eve of their first national tour. Cook had lost interest in the rock scene and could barely play a musical instrument, he agreed to move to Hull to join them. The band soon had a hit single with ""Happy Hour"". They also reached number one just before Christmas 1986 with a version of ""Caravan of Love"" originally a hit the year before for Isley Jasper Isley. However, by 1988 they had split up. Heaton and the band's drummer Dave Hemingway went on to form The Beautiful South, while Cook moved back to Brighton to pursue his interest in the style of music he preferred. It was at this time that he first started working with young studio engineer Simon Thornton, with whom he continues to make records. All Cook's records released from that point onwards have involved both of them to varying degrees (Thornton is credited in 2004 as ""Executive Producer"" for example).

Cook formed Beats International, a loose confederation of studio musicians including vocalists Lindy Layton, Lester Noel, D.J. Baptiste, rapper MC Wildski, and keyboardist Andy Boucher. Their first album, Let Them Eat Bingo, included the number one single, ""Dub Be Good to Me"". ""Dub Be Good To Me"" caused a legal dispute revolving around allegations of infringement of copyright through the liberal use of unauthorised samples: the bassline was a note-for-note lift from The Clash's ""The Guns Of Brixton"" and the song also borrowed heavily from the S.O.S. Band's ""Just Be Good to Me"". The 1991 follow-up album Excursion on the Version, an exploration of dub and reggae rhythms, failed to repeat the success of its predecessor.

Cook then formed Freakpower, with horn player and singer Ashley Slater. The duo released their debut album, Drive Thru Booty, in 1994, which contained the single ""Turn On Tune In Cop Out"". The cut was picked up by the Levi's company for use in a multimillion-dollar advertisement campaign. Freakpower has also done several other releases under the name Fried Funk Food.

In 1995, Cook enlisted help from producer friends Tim Jeffery and JC Reid to create a solo house music album under the 'Pizzaman' pseudonym. The Pizzamania album spawned 3 UK Top 40 hits in ""Trippin' on Sunshine"", ""Sex on the Streets"" and ""Happiness"". ""Happiness"" was picked up by the Del Monte Foods corporation for use in a UK fruit juice ad.

Cook is also behind a group The Mighty Dub Katz along with Gareth Hansome (aka GMoney), Cook's former flatmate and the inventor of the name ""Big Beat"". Together they started the Boutique Nightclub in Brighton, formerly known as the Big Beat Boutique, evidently imitating the Heavenly Social in London. In 1996, Cook then re-joined Ashley Slater for the second Freakpower album, titled More of Everything for Everybody. 

The Fatboy Slim album Better Living Through Chemistry (released through Skint Records) marked Cook's emergence into the big time. Filled with retro samples and funk-laden grooves, the album was among the first in the then-new big beat sound. It also spawned one Top 40 UK hit, ""Everybody Needs a 303"". After Cook's remix of Cornershop's ""Brimful of Asha"" topped the charts, such musical heavy hitters as Madonna and U2 asked him to produce for them.

Fatboy Slim's next work was the single ""The Rockafeller Skank,"" released prior to the album You've Come a Long Way, Baby, both of which were released in 1998 to rave reviews. This album also produced the single ""Praise You"", which also became a major dance hit, giving Cook his first UK solo number one. Its video, directed by Spike Jonze, won numerous awards. Further Fatboy Slim works have appeared in movies, television series, and more ads and started a trend where Norman Cook appeared in each video in some shape or form. In 1999, he was on tour, stopping in San Francisco and New York's Hammerstein Ballroom. It should be noted that the single Rockafeller Skank was based entirely around a Lord Finesse vocal sample; ""Right about now, the funk soul brother. Check it out now, the funk soul brother"".

Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars was released in 2000 and featured two collaborations with Macy Gray. It also included ""Sunset (Bird of Prey)"", a slower tempo piece based around a sample of Jim Morrison from The Doors, and ""Weapon of Choice"", which also boasted an award-winning video starring Christopher Walken.

On 13 July 2002 Fatboy Slim performed the second of his free, open air concerts on Brighton beach. Despite expecting a crowd of around 60,000 people the event instead attracted an estimated 250,000 who crammed the promenade and beach between Brighton's famous piers. Local police forced the event to end early amid safety concerns, overcrowding, and one death. After the music had finished and the crowd began to dissipate, traffic ensued throughout the Brighton area with many caught in traffic jams until the morning.

Cook was awarded a star on the city of Brighton's Walk of Fame, next to that of Winston Churchill. He married TV personality Zoë Ball in 1999; the couple have one son named Woody. Cook is also a 12% shareholder of the football club he has supported since moving to Brighton in the late 1980s, Brighton & Hove Albion.

Fatboy has often played to welcoming crowds in the superclubs of Ibiza, where he also met his wife. 2002 saw him make appearances at Space and Privilege. At Space there was a minor altercation when Cook inadvertently faded down the house PA while playing on the Terrace during the marathon 'We Love Sundays' closing party. With only the booth monitors barely audible the crowd began to shuffle indifferently, in stark contrast to Cook who was having a great time behind the decks. This continued for several minutes until 'We Love' promoter Darren Hughes ran into the booth, grabbed the appropriate control on the mixer and slammed the volume back to full blast. This resulted in a humorous acknowledgement from Cook and euphoria amongst the assembled revellers. Cook went on to complete a memorable set, including a classic Space Terrace moment with John Paul Young's vintage singalong track ""Love is in the Air"".

The following day Cook appeared in the main room at Privilege, officially the world's biggest club, for Manumission. His set began well but a thunderstorm was raging outside and after a few records the house PA failed, and once again Cook was playing to a huge crowd with only the weak output of the booth monitors. Attempting to make the best of the situation, Cook angled the monitors towards the crowd and continued with his set, at least entertaining those clubbers fortunate enough to be near the booth. In the cavernous space of Privilege this proved futile and after a short while Cook abandoned any attempt to DJ, removed his shoe, placed this on the turntable, then finally admitted defeat and departed the booth with a shrug of the shoulders and a wave to the disappointed crowd.

Later the same year Q magazine named Fatboy Slim in their 50 Bands To See Before You Die list.

In January 2003, Cook and his wife underwent a very public break-up, but three months later, they were reconciled.

In 2004, Cook released two remixes in June and July, based on Max Sedgley's ""Happy"" and ""Follow Me Follow Me (Quem Que Caguetou)"" by Black Alien & Speed. The latter, a Hip Hop hit from Brazil, became popular in Europe after having appeared on the Nissan X-Trail advert (portraying a more extreme type of marathon). Fatboy Slim's remix was then used in the advert itself.

His first album in four years, Palookaville, was less successful than previous releases. In the UK, BBC Radio 1 received an exclusive play of the first single ""Slash Dot Dash"", while in the U.S. ""The Joker"" (a collaboration with Bootsy Collins) had been exclusively aired. The song was appearing on the radio and was made quickly available on iTunes months ahead of the album release.

Palookaville represented a significant shift in style for Cook, from loop and sample based compositions to more conventional song structures and many original recordings of real instruments (Cook himself plays bass on some of the album's tracks, with Simon Thornton playing various other instruments along with guest artists, e.g. Justin Robertson). This change in style also led to the use of new production techniques and studio technology. Until Palookaville Cook had been using an Atari ST computer for sequencing and composition, a classic production tool favoured by many dance music producers for its stability, simplicity and rock solid timing. For the new album he made use of a Pro Tools rig, a powerful digital audio workstation environment found in most modern recording studios. This perhaps reluctant move by Cook was ultimately necessary to deliver the polished production style evident in the recordings. The resulting body of work features ""traditional"" Fatboy Slim tracks such as ""Jin Go Lo Ba"" alongside full length vocal tracks including a suitably updated rendition of the Steve Miller Band's ""The Joker"". (The music video for the latter consists entirely of kittens in the lead roles). The album also features many more vocal collaborations including tracks with rapper Lateef, Brighton-based band Johnny Quality and Damon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz).

In 2005, his 2004 hit single ""Wonderful Night"" was placed on Konami's Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 for PlayStation 2.

In June 2005 he filled the Friday night headline slot on the 'Other Stage' at the Glastonbury Festival, a booking which actually generated a financial loss for Cook when he decided to stage a spectacular visual show involving banks of display screens at the rear of the stage (with his DJ booth set in the middle) and a sophisticated 3D light show with special glasses supplied to members of the audience. In a televised post-gig interview Cook revealed how the cost of staging the show had outstripped the famously low appearance fees received by Glastonbury performers.[5]

In October of the same year Fatboy Slim and Talking Heads singer David Byrne revealed their plans for a musical about Imelda Marcos, the controversial ex-First Lady of the Philippines. It premiered at Australia's Adelaide Festival of Arts in March 2006.

On the New Years Eve 2005, Fatboy Slim performed live on Bondi Beach in Australia. During this all night set, Fatboy Slim reverted to his original style of music production and DJing with an emphasis on Dance music.

Why Try Harder is Fatboy Slim's greatest hits album and was released on 19 June 2006. It comprises eighteen tracks, including ten Top 40 singles, a couple of Number Ones and two exclusive new tracks - ""Champion Sound"" and ""That Old Pair of Jeans"". The title comes from the famous UK album cover for You've Come a Long Way Baby, which featured a large man with a T-shirt bearing the legend ""I'M #1 SO WHY TRY HARDER"". Cook has repeatedly stated in 2006 interviews that the phrase ""why try harder"" is a statement, not a question.

On 24 June 2006, Fatboy Slim headlined The ""Rock Ness Festival"" at Loch Ness, Scotland. The following month he also filled the Saturday headline slot at the Global Gathering festival, Long Marston Airfield in the English Midlands. He played a two hour set containing most of his classics and also some of his new material. This is widely regarded as one of the highlights of the festival, perhaps just losing out to Daft Punk's once in a lifetime performance the previous evening. Once again Fatboy appeared in front of an impressive visual stage set comprising video screens and 3D lighting. A spectacular firework display rounded off the show.

After being banned by police from playing in Brighton since 2002 after the deaths of two people at his 2002 gig, Fatboy Slim was given permission in 2006 to play again in his home town.

It should be noted that the first death was a heart attack brought on by natural causes and the second death was caused by a fall from a wall some time after the gig had finished. The police attributed no blame to Fatboy Slim or the promoter for the deaths. However the promoter had massively underestimated the numbers that would attend, mainly due to the show being unofficially advertised on a London radio station. As a result the entire towns roads and pavements became grid locked and the emergency services were heavily affected.

On 1 January 2007 he played to an audience of over 20,000 fans along Brighton's seafront (along Madeira Drive along the beach east of Brighton Pier). Tickets to the event were made available only to Brighton residents, although inevitably some were sold to others on eBay. He recently performed in Brazil, in its version of the Big Brother reality show.

Fatboy Slim's Big Beach Boutique 3 was deemed a stunning success by Sussex Police, Fatboy Slim, and the crowd. The gathering was named ""best party city"" by DJ David Guetta, although this was just after both his CD mixers broke down. ""Luckily"" he said ""Fatboy plays vinyl"" and so the crowd returned. The Cuban Brothers and David Guetta opened the show. Cook performed mixes of Gorillaz and Fedde Le Grand's ""Put Your Hands Up For (Brighton)"".

Summer 2007 saw Fatboy take a well earned break from the DJ circuit, although he did still return for appearances at Glastonbury and in Ibiza. Glastonbury saw him headlining the East Dance Tent on Friday night and also playing an intimate Saturday night secret gig in the Lost Vagueness ballroom, sharing the bill with ska legends Madness. Befitting of a Lost Vagueness party, Cook accompanied his DJ set with a protracted costume change, transitioning smoothly from a regular set of casual clothes into what could best be described as a bizarre and somewhat revealing bee outfit, complete with novelty wings. For his return to Ibiza, Cook once again joined up with the Manumission crew, now creating their unique brand of Mayhem in legendary superclub Amnesia. Here he shared the bill with Sheffield indie boys Arctic Monkeys and Radio One DJ Zane Lowe.

In summer 2007, ""The Rockafeller Skank"" was used for season 3 of So You Think You Can Dance. In September 2007, the song was also featured on Konami's Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2 for PlayStation 2.

According to Norman's regular ""Ask Norm"" segment on his MySpace, his untitled fifth studio album has Iggy Pop collaborating with him, and the album is ""seven-eighths finished"". The recording process has been completed, but the record is yet to be mixed. There are 18 tracks on the record.


Recently, the DJ was featured in the Closing Ceremony of the Summer 2012 Olympics, the XXX Olympiad, in London. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Fatboy+Slim"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
John Williams,"There are at least five artists with this name: 

(1) John Towner Williams (film score composer)
(2) John Christopher Williams (classical guitarist)
(3) John Williams (Irish musician)
(4) John Williams (blues/jazz guitarist)
(5) John Knowles Williams (experimental/indie)
---------------------------------------------

(1) John Towner Williams (born February 8, 1932) is one of the most widely recognized composers of film scores. As of 2013, he has received 48 music-related Academy Award nominations, an accomplishment surpassed by none.

Early scores and compositions are credited as Johnny Williams.

Williams is best known for heroic, rousing themes in adventure and fantasy films. This includes some of the highest grossing films of all time, such as the Star Wars movies, the Superman movies, Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, and the first three Harry Potter movies. His richly thematic and highly popular 1977 score to the first Star Wars film was selected by the American Film Institute as the greatest American movie score of all time. Five of his film scores won Oscars.

His long career has also included many sensitive dramatic scores (such as Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and Munich) and quirky character studies (like Catch Me If You Can, the theme for which makes extensive use of jazz, perhaps in homage to Mancini's famous music for The Pink Panther). Also noteworthy are his recent collaborations with Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman on the score for Memoirs of a Geisha, as well as Williams' other more experimental concert works.

Williams has composed the scores for every Steven Spielberg movie, with the exception of The Color Purple (scored by co-producer Quincy Jones) and Duel (Spielberg's first feature film).

While skilled in a variety of twentieth-century compositional idioms, his most familiar style may be described as a form of neo-romanticism, influenced by his predecessors and their use of large-scale orchestral music. Korngold (and other Hollywood Golden Age composers), is clearly evident in many of Williams' most famous works.

Anyone who has watched the Olympics on television has heard Williams' ""Olympic Fanfare and Theme,"" parts of which (especially the last fifteen seconds of the fanfare) receive extensive playtime every four years.

Williams also composed ""The Mission,"" the worldwide-known theme from NBC News.

---------------------------------------------
(2) John Christopher Williams is a classical guitar player.

Born in Melbourne, Australia, on 24 April 1941, to an English father (Len Williams) and an Australian-Chinese mother, Williams was taught initially by his father. At the age of twelve he went to Italy to study under ""The Maestro,"" Andrés Segovia. Later, he attended the Royal College of Music in London, studying piano because the school did not have a guitar department at the time. Upon graduation, he was offered the opportunity to create such a department. He seized the opportunity and ran it for the first two years. Williams has maintained links with the College (and with the Northern College in Manchester) ever since.

Williams is best known as a classical guitarist, but has explored many different musical traditions. He has collaborated with Julian Bream and Paco Peña and was a member of the fusion group Sky. He is also a composer and arranger.

Williams has commissioned guitar concertos from composers such as Stephen Dodgson, André Previn, Patrick Gowers, Richard Harvey, and Steve Gray. He has also worked with composers from his native Australia, including Phillip Houghton, Peter Sculthorpe, Ross Edwards (composer), and Nigel Westlake, to produce guitar works that capture the spirit of his homeland.

He enjoyed a worldwide hit single with his recording of Cavatina by Stanley Myers, used as the theme tune to the Oscar-winning film The Deer Hunter (1979). The piece had originally been written for piano, for another film ten years earlier, The Walking Stick (1970) but re-written for guitar and expanded by Myers at Williams' invitation. In 1973, Cleo Laine wrote lyrics and recorded the song ""He Was Beautiful"" accompanied by John Williams. A year later, it was a top-five UK hit single for Iris Williams (no relation).

At the invitation of producer Martin Lewis he created a highly acclaimed classical-rock fusion duet with celebrated rock guitarist Pete Townshend of Townshend's anthemic ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" for the 1979 Amnesty International benefit show The Secret Policeman's Ball. The duet was featured on the resulting album and the film version of the show – bringing Williams to the broader attention of the rock audience.

The relationship with Lewis led to Williams' classical-rock fusion band Sky being invited to give the first-ever rock concert to be held at Westminster Abbey – a benefit concert for Amnesty that Lewis produced in February 1981.

He is visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Music, London.

Williams and his artist wife Kathy Panama reside in London and Australia.

---------------------------------------------
(3) John Williams

John Williams is internationally regarded as one of the foremost players of Irish music today. With five All-Ireland titles to his credit, John is the only American-born competitor ever to win first place in the ""senior concertina"" category. His additional talents on flute, button accordion, bodhran, and piano distinguish him as a much sought after multi-instrumentalist in the acoustic scene around the world.

Born and raised on the Southwest Side of Chicago, John spent his summers during college on the Southwest coast of Ireland in his father’s village of Doolin, Co. Clare. Like Chicago, Doolin became a major musical crossroads for John and countless other local and international musicians to meet and exchange music. Gigging every night in the pubs of Doolin and Lisdoonvarna soon led to performances in Galway, Cork, Dublin, Belfast, Paris, Britanny, Zurich, and New York City (bio http://www.johnwilliamsmusic.com/bio.htm).

Breaking Benjamin,"Breaking Benjamin is a post-grunge/alternative metal band Formed in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, USA in 1998 by vocalist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel, Breaking Benjamin quickly garnered a strong local following. 

1st Studio Album [2002] - Saturate
The band signed to Hollywood Records in 2001 after the success of an independently-released, self-titled EP, which sold all 2,000 copies that were manufactured. Hollywood Records released their full-length, major-label debut, Saturate, on August 27, 2002. The album's first single, ""Polyamorous"", received a fair amount of radio play, although it failed to reach mainstream audiences. A video was released in two different versions for Polyamorous: one that had all live-action footage, and one that had footage of the video game Run Like Hell. The following single ""Skin"" was also released from Saturate, although it fared worse than ""Polyamorous"" and received even less airplay. ""Skin"" was also performed live on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show. ""Medicate"" was also released as a single, to little commercial success and airplay. Saturate has gone on to sell over 300,000 copies.

2nd Studio Album [2004] - We Are Not Alone
Breaking Benjamin released their second album, We Are Not Alone, on June 29, 2004. The album featured the lead off single ""So Cold"", which reached number two on the United States Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. The band had two music videos made for the song, one of which was a promotional video made for the movie Hellboy. The commercial success of ""So Cold"" led to We Are Not Alone achieving platinum status in late 2005. Also released as singles from the album were ""Sooner or Later"" and a re- recorded version of ""Rain"", which was featured on later pressings of the album. While the former again got the band as high as number two on the Mainstream Rock chart and featured a music video, the latter garnered little radio play and had no video created for it. Another song off ""We Are Not Alone"", ""Sooner or Later"", had a video created for it and got a fair amount of radio play. Later in 2004, the band released the So Cold EP. The EP contained live recordings of We Are Not Alone's ""So Cold"" (an acoustic recording), ""Breakdown"", and ""Away"", as well as studio recordings of ""Blow Me Away"", a song that was featured in Bungie's video game Halo 2, and ""Lady Bug"", an early fan favorite of the band's.

In September of 2004, drummer, and founding member of Breaking Benjamin, Jeremy Hummel was relieved of his duties in the band. Subsequently, on September 28, 2005, Hummel filed a federal lawsuit against the remaining members of Breaking Benjamin, as well as its management, claiming he was not paid for songs he helped write. Hummel's lawsuit asked for more than $8 million in damages. A message was released October 25, 2006 on the bands official website stating that the band and Hummel had come to agreement on the lawsuit.

3rd Studio Album [2006] - Phobia
In the fall of 2006 the band began a tour opening for Godsmack for the IV tour, hitting up mostly eastern and Ohio Valley venues, and soon moving out west, still in support of the Phobia album, released on August 8 that year. Several of the shows had been canceled, or turned into Breaking Benjamin headliners due to scheduling conflicts. Many of Breaking Benjamin's tour dates from December 3rd have been rescheduled due to illness in the band's ranks. All dates were rescheduled as the band announced another headlining leg before going on a nationwide tour with Three Days Grace and Nickelback.

On March 4, 2007, HDNet premiered a one-hour show of the Breaking Benjamin concert in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania at Stabler Arena. This is also the concert that was included on the Phobia re-release DVD in April of 2007, advertised as ""The Homecoming"". Footage of the band's live Stabler Arena performance of ""Breath"" comprises the song's music video.

On April 17, 2007, Breaking Benjamin re-released the album Phobia. The album featured a DVD with about an hour of their Stabler Arena concert footage.

4th Studio Album [2009] - Dear Agony
On the 29th of September, 2009, Breaking Benjamin released their 4th studio album, entitled ""Dear Agony"". Some of the tracks on the album, were co-written by Jasen Rauch, from the Christian-metal band Red. 
On September 23, 2009, Breaking Benjamin released a flash video game parody of Altered Beast, aptly titled ""Altered Benjamin"". The game contains three levels and plays the same as the original, except the player controls vocalist Ben Burnley and the three bosses are each other member of the band respectively. Altered Benjamin is still available through the band's website, and their MySpace page.

Certain copies of Dear Agony purchased at Best Buy also come with a bonus DVD that includes the band's six music videos including a previously-unreleased version of the video for ""I Will Not Bow"". The version on the DVD is of the band only and does not contain any footage from the movie Surrogates, unlike the version released on the Internet.

On August 31st, 2009, prior to the release of Dear Agony, Breaking Benjamin released their first single from DA, ""I Will Not Bow"". It was featured in the 2009 Sci-Fi film [Starring Bruce Willis], ""Surrogates"". The song was not written specifically for the film, but according to drummer Chad Szeliga, “Ben sent a few songs to our record label, Hollywood Records,” which is owned by Disney, who then decided they “wanted a Breaking Benjamin song for this movie.”

The music video for I Will Not Bow was released to the band's Myspace on August 21, 2009. The video was shot at the World Trade Center building 7, but has no connection or significant meaning having to do with the 9/11 events as stated by Aaron Fink in his Point interview on August 13, 2009. The video was directed by Rich Lee who has also directed for Evanescence. Lee chose the location, feeling it was an eerie place to film.
A second version of the music video without the Surrogates footage was released with the Best Buy Exclusive version of Dear Agony. It includes various bridged footage of the band performing.

On January 5, 2010, Give Me a Sign was the second single released from Breaking Benjamin's fourth studio album, Dear Agony.

2 extra tracks were featured on the Japanese version of ""Dear Agony"". An acoustic version of 'Without You', and an acoustic version 'Give Me A Sign'.

Hiatus, greatest hits album and legal issues [2010-2014]
In the summer of 2010, Breaking Benjamin announced an indefinite hiatus, due to Burnley's recurring illnesses. Guitarist Fink and bassist Klepaski rejoined their old band, Lifer, and Szeliga toured with his other band, OurAfter.

On June 7, 2011, a remixed version of ""Blow Me Away"", featuring Valora, was released.[17] An animated music video for the remix was released on August 24.[18] On June 30, 2011, Rock Access posted the tracklist for the band's greatest hits album, Shallow Bay: The Best of Breaking Benjamin, and for its ""deluxe edition"".[19] It was released on August 16, as a one-disc ""standard edition"" and a two-disc ""deluxe edition"" (featuring b-sides and rarities). Burnley publicly opposed the album's release, saying content had been altered and released without his consent, and that it did not meet his standards.

In May 2011, Burnley fired bandmates Fink and Klepaski. Shortly after, a dispute over the new version of ""Blow Me Away"" went public. Burnley gave his side of the dispute in a June court filing, saying Fink and Klepaski made unilateral and unauthorized decisions on behalf of the band, such as giving permission in May for the remixing of ""Blow Me Away"". Burnley seeks at least $250,000 and the exclusive right to the ""Breaking Benjamin"" name. Burnley has stated he plans to revive the band when the lawsuit is settled.

Little was heard from the band throughout 2012, the only exception being a February 2012 interview with Szeliga, where he assured fans that the band was still together, and that he looked forward to working on another record in the future. On April 19, 2013, Burnley announced that the legal issues had finally ended, with Burnley winning the rights to the name of the band. However, Szeliga posted an announcement on his Facebook page on April 22 that he was leaving the band, due to creative differences. In October-November 2013, Burnley played a number of acoustic performances around the Wilkes-Barre area, playing Breaking Benjamin songs.

Reformation [2014-present]
On August 19, 2014, the band announced that they had reformed via their official Facebook page. The band re-emerged as a quintet, consisting Burnley as the lead vocalist and four new members. New members include guitarist Jasen Rauch, previously of the band Red, who had previously collaborated with the band off of four tracks on Dear Agony, guitarist Keith Wallen, previously of Adelitas Way, bassist Aaron Bruch, who played a couple of acoustic shows previously with Burnley, and drummer Shaun Foist, previously of the band Picture Me Broken.
In 2016 the band will go for the first time to Europe.

Name Origin
The name ""Breaking Benjamin"" comes from Benjamin Burnley's early solo experience. Burnley was covering a Nirvana song during an open-mic night at a club when he finished he dropped the microphone to the ground, breaking it. The person who owned the microphone came on stage and said, 'Thanks to Benjamin for breaking my fucking mic.' In 1999, the band briefly renamed themselves ""Plan 9."" In late 2000, after various line-up changes, the band changed its name back to ""Breaking Benjamin"" and two friends of Burnley, Aaron Fink and Mark Klepaski, left their previous band, Lifer, and joined the ranks of Breaking Benjamin as guitarist and bassist, respectively. Lifer was a band that gained brief mainstream attention because of their part in an MTV cover band contest that resulted in a record deal with Universal Records.

Billy Talent,"Billy Talent is a Juno Award-winning Canadian rock band formed in 1993. They performed and recorded together for about a decade before finding a wide mainstream following. Originally called Pezz, the group originates from Streetsville, in Mississauga, Ontario, but now hail from Toronto, Ontario. 

The name is inspired by a character named ""Billy Tallent"" in the 1993 book ""Hard Core Logo"" by Michael Turner (filmed in 1996) and it has been the name of the band since 2001, after a dispute with the American Pezz.

To date, the band have released five studio albums, the first under the name Pezz named ""Watoosh!"", the second under the Billy Talent name is called ""Billy Talent"" with the third called ""Billy Talent II"".

Billy Talent have also released a live DVD/CD, ""666"" featuring live performances from London, Dusseldorf, and the Rock Am Ring festival, held at the Nürburgring in Germany. They have also released two live albums from London and Manchester in September of 2006, of which only 500 of each exist.

Drummer Aaron Solowoniuk revealed that the song ""This Is How It Goes"" was written for him by Ben with the subject being Aaron's struggle with multiple sclerosis, in an open letter to fans posted on the official website in March 2006. As a sign of the dedication to finding a cure for MS, the band hold an annual show in Canada named ""F.U.MS"" in which all funds go towards the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada.

Cream,"Cream was a 1960s three-piece British band consisting of bassist/lead vocalist Jack Bruce, guitarist/vocalist Eric Clapton, and drummer Ginger Baker, having formed in London, England. They were known as one of the first great power trios and supergroups of rock. Their sound was characterised by a hybrid of blues, hard rock and psychedelic rock. Cream combined Clapton's blues guitar playing with the powerful and airy voice and intense bass lines of Jack Bruce and the manic drumming of Ginger Baker. They have sold over 35 million albums worldwide. Wheels of Fire was the world's first platinum-selling double album.
Baker, Bruce, and Clapton named their band ""Cream"" because they thought themselves as the ""cream of the crop"" of their respective instruments.

Cream's music included songs based on traditional blues such as ""Crossroads"" and ""Spoonful"", and modern blues such as ""Born Under a Bad Sign"" and ""Outside Woman Blues"" as well as more eccentric songs such as ""Strange Brew"", ""Tales of Brave Ulysses"" and ""Toad"". Cream's biggest hits were ""I Feel Free"" (UK, #11)[4], ""Sunshine of Your Love"" (US, #5)[5], ""White Room"" (US, #6)[5], ""Crossroads"" (US, #28)[5], and ""Badge"" (UK, #18).

Cream, together with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, made a significant impact upon the popular music of the time, providing a heavy yet technically proficient musical theme that foreshadowed the emergence of bands such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and The Jeff Beck Group in the late 1960s. The band's live performances influenced progressive rock acts such as Rush, jam bands such as The Allman Brothers Band, Grateful Dead and Phish, and heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.

Cream were ranked #16 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

By July of 1966, Eric Clapton's career with The Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers had earned him a reputation as the premier blues guitarist in Britain.[2] Clapton's virtuosity and raw power with the instrument inspired one fan to spray paint the words ""Clapton is God"" on the wall of an Islington underground station.[7] Clapton, however, found the environment of Mayall's band confining, and sought to expand his playing in a new band.

In 1966, Clapton met Baker, then the leader of the Graham Bond Organisation, which at one point featured Jack Bruce on bass, harmonica and piano. Baker, too, felt stifled in the GBO, and had grown tired of Graham Bond's drug addictions and bouts of mental instability. ""I had always liked Ginger"", explained Clapton. ""Ginger had come to see me play with John Mayall. After the gig he drove me back to London in his Rover. I was very impressed with his car and driving. He was telling me that he wanted to start a band, and I had been thinking about it too.""[8] Each was impressed with the other's playing abilities, prompting Baker to ask Clapton to join his new, then-unnamed group. Clapton immediately agreed, on the condition that Baker hire Jack Bruce as the group's bassist[4]; according to Clapton, when he made the suggestion, Baker almost crashed the car.[9]

Clapton had met Bruce when the bassist/vocalist did a short stint with the Bluesbreakers in March 1966[4]; the two had also worked together as part of a one-shot band called Powerhouse (which also included Steve Winwood and Paul Jones). Impressed with Bruce's vocals and technical prowess, Clapton had wanted to work with him on an ongoing basis.

What Clapton did not know was that while Bruce was in Bond's band, he and Baker had been notorious for their quarreling.[10] While both were excellent jazz musicians and respected each other's skills, the confines of the GBO had proved too small for their egos. Their volatile relationship included on-stage fights and the sabotage of one another's instruments.[10] After Baker fired Bruce from the band, Bruce continued to arrive for gigs; ultimately, Bruce was driven away from the band after Baker threatened him at knifepoint.

Nevertheless, Baker and Bruce were able to put aside their differences for the good of Baker's new trio, which he envisioned as collaborative, with each of the members contributing to music and lyrics. The band was named ""Cream"", as Clapton, Bruce, and Baker were already considered the ""cream of the crop"" amongst blues and jazz musicians in the exploding British music scene. Before deciding upon ""Cream"", the band considered calling themselves ""Sweet 'n' Sour Rock 'n' Roll"". Of the trio, Clapton had the biggest reputation in England; however, he was all but unknown in the United States. He left The Yardbirds before ""For Your Love"" hit the American Top Ten.[2]

Cream made their unofficial debut at the Twisted Wheel on 29 July 1966.[4][11] Their official debut came two nights later at the Sixth Annual Windsor Jazz & Blues Festival.[4][11] Being new and with few original songs to their credit, Cream performed spirited blues reworkings that thrilled the large crowd and earned them a warm reception. In October, they also got a chance to jam with Jimi Hendrix, who had recently arrived in London. Hendrix was a fan of Clapton's music, and wanted a chance to play with him onstage.[4] Hendrix was introduced to Cream through Chas Chandler, the bassist of The Animals, who was Hendrix's manager.[4]

It was during the early organisation that they decided Bruce would serve as the group's lead vocalist. While Clapton was shy about singing[12], he occasionally harmonised with Bruce and, in time, took lead vocals on some notable Cream tunes including ""Four Until Late""[13], ""Strange Brew""[14], ""Crossroads""[15], and ""Badge""[16]

Fresh Cream

Cream's debut album, Fresh Cream, was recorded and released in 1966. The album reached #6 in the UK charts and #39 in the United States.[17] It mainly consisted of blues covers, including ""Four Until Late"", ""Rollin' and Tumblin'"" (written by Muddy Waters), ""Spoonful"" (written by Willie Dixon and recorded by Howlin' Wolf), ""I'm So Glad"" and ""Cat's Squirrel"".[18] The rest of the album featured songs written (or co-written) by Jack Bruce, most notably ""Wrapping Paper"" and ""I Feel Free"" (which was a UK hit single[4], but only released on the American edition of the LP), and a couple of songs written by Ginger Baker (one of which, ""Toad"", contained one of the earliest examples of a drum solo in rock music).

The early Cream bootlegs show that the band had not developed their signature jamming capabilities. These recordings capture a much tighter band showcasing more songs. All of the songs are reasonably short five-minute versions of ""N.S.U."", ""Sweet Wine"" and ""Toad"". But a mere two months later, the setlist had been shortened with the songs now much longer.


Cream first visited the United States in March 1967 to play nine dates at the RKO Theater in New York. They returned to record Disraeli Gears in New York between 11 May and 15 May 1967. Cream's second album was released in November 1967 and reached the Top 5 in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.[19] Produced by Felix Pappalardi (who later co-founded the Cream-inspired quartet Mountain) and engineer Tom Dowd, it was recorded at Atlantic Studios in New York. Disraeli Gears is often considered to be the band's defining effort, successfully blending psychedelic British rock with American blues. It was also the first Cream album to consist primarily of original songs, with only three of the eleven tracks written by others outside the band. Disraeli Gears not only features hits ""Strange Brew"" and ""Tales of Brave Ulysses"", but also ""Sunshine of Your Love"".

Although the album is considered one of Cream's finest efforts, it is not well represented in Cream's live sets. Although they consistently played ""Tales of Brave Ulysses"" and ""Sunshine of Your Love"", a setlist consisting of several songs from Disraeli Gears was quickly dropped from the set in mid-1967, favouring longer blues jams instead of short pop songs. Only ""We're Going Wrong"" saw some occasional play time in their live sets. In fact, at their 2005 reunion shows, Cream only played three songs from Disraeli Gears: ""Outside Woman Blues,"" ""We're Going Wrong,"" and ""Sunshine of Your Love.""

In late 1967, they incorporated more jamming time in their repertoire, some songs stretching out to 20 minutes. According to Jack Bruce, they were obliged to play 20-minute jams or the audience would angrily ask for their money back. Long drawn-out jams in songs like ""Spoonful"", ""N.S.U."" and ""Sweet Wine"" became live favorites. Nonetheless, songs like ""Sunshine of Your Love"", ""Crossroads"", and ""Tales of Brave Ulysses"" remained reasonably short.

Disraeli Gears

Disraeli Gears is the second album by British blues-rock group Cream. It was released in November 1967 and went on to reach #5 on the UK album chart. It was also their American breakthrough, becoming a massive seller there in 1968, reaching #4 on the American charts. The album features the two singles “Strange Brew” and “Sunshine of Your Love”. By this time, the group was veering quite heavily away from their blues roots to indulge in more psychedelic sounds.

Wheels of Fire

In 1968 came Cream's third release, Wheels of Fire, which topped the American charts. Wheels of Fire showcased Cream moving slightly away from the blues and more towards a semi-progressive rock style highlighted by odd time signatures and various orchestral instruments. However, the band did record a live blues favorite, ""Sitting on Top of the World"". The opening song, ""White Room"", became a popular radio staple. Another song, ""Politician"", was written by the band while waiting to perform live at the BBC.[8] According to a BBC interview with Clapton, the record company, also handling Albert King, asked the band to cover ""Born Under a Bad Sign"", which became a popular track off the record.

The album's second disc featured three live recordings from the Winterland Ballroom and one from the Fillmore. Eric Clapton's solo in ""Crossroads"" has made it to the top 20 in multiple ""greatest guitar solo"" lists.[20][21][22] The 16-minute ""Spoonful"", from their March Winterland show, became their most epic song and a concert favourite. Ginger Baker's ""Toad"" is now widely-regarded as one of the greatest live drum solos in rock history[citation needed].

After the completion of Wheels of Fire in mid-1968, the band members had had enough and wanted to go their separate ways. As Baker would state in a 2006 interview with Music Mart magazine, ""It just got to the point where Eric said to me: 'I've had enough of this,' and I said so have I. I couldn't stand it. The last year with Cream was just agony. It's damaged my hearing permanently, and today I've still got a hearing problem because of the sheer volume throughout the last year of Cream. But it didn't start off like that. In 1966, it was great. It was really a wonderful experience musically, and it just went into the realms of stupid."" Also, Bruce and Baker's combustible relationship proved even worse as a result of the strain put upon the band by non-stop touring, forcing Clapton to play the perpetual role of peacekeeper.

Clapton had also fallen under the spell of Bob Dylan's former backing group, now known as The Band, and their debut album, Music from Big Pink[4], which proved to be a welcome breath of fresh air in comparison to the incense and psychedelia that had informed Cream. Furthermore, he had read a scathing Cream review in Rolling Stone magazine, a publication he had much admired, where the reviewer, Jon Landau, called him a master of ""the blues cliché.""[4] It was in the wake of that article that Clapton wanted to end Cream and pursue a different musical direction.

At the beginning of their farewell tour on 4 October 1968, in Oakland, nearly the entire set consisted of songs from Wheels of Fire: ""White Room"", ""Politician"", ""Crossroads"", ""Spoonful"", ""Deserted Cities of the Heart"", and ""Passing the Time"" taking place of ""Toad"" for a drum solo. ""Passing the Time"" and ""Deserted Cities"" were quickly removed from the setlist and replaced by ""Sitting on Top of the World"" and ""Toad"".

Goodbye

Cream was eventually persuaded to do one final album. That album, the appropriately titled Goodbye, was recorded in late 1968 and released in early 1969, after the band had broken up. It featured six songs: three live recordings dating from a concert at The Forum in Los Angeles, California, on 19 October, and three new studio recordings (the most notable, ""Badge"", was written by Clapton and George Harrison, who also played rhythm guitar). ""I'm So Glad"", which first appeared as a studio recording on Fresh Cream, appeared as a live track on Goodbye. It was the only song to appear on both Cream's first and last albums.

Cream's ""farewell tour"" consisted of 22 shows at 19 venues in the United States between 4 October and 4 November 1968, and two final farewell concerts at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 November 1968. Initially another double album was planned, comprising live material from this tour plus new studio tracks, but a single album, Goodbye was released instead with three live tracks taken from their performance at The Forum in Los Angeles on 19 October 1968, and three studio tracks, one written by each of the band members. The final United States gig was at the Rhode Island Auditorium, 4 November 1968.

The two Royal Albert Hall concerts were filmed for a BBC documentary and released on video (and later DVD) as Farewell Concert. Both shows were sold out and attracted more attention than any other Cream concert, but their performance was regarded by many as below standard. Baker himself said of the concerts: ""It wasn’t a good gig ... Cream was better than that ... We knew it was all over. We knew we were just finishing it off, getting it over with."" Cream's live performances were already declining. In an interview from Cream: Classic Artists, Ginger Baker himself agreed that the band was getting worse by the minute.[23]

Cream's supporting acts were Taste (featuring a young Rory Gallagher) and the newly formed Yes, who received good reviews.

Breakup

From its creation, Cream was faced with some fundamental problems that would later lead to its dissolution in November 1968. The rivalry between Bruce and Baker created tensions in the band. Clapton also felt that the members of the band did not listen to each other enough. Clapton once told a story that when Cream were playing in a concert, he stopped playing and neither Baker nor Bruce noticed.[10] Cream decided that it would break up in May of 1968 during a tour of the US.[24] Later, in July, an official announcement was made that the band would break up after a farewell tour of the United States and after playing two concerts in London. Cream finished its tour of the United States with a 4 November concert in Rhode Island and performed in the UK for the last time in London on 25 and 26 November.[24]

Reunions (1993, 2005)

In 1993, Cream was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and set aside their differences to perform at the induction ceremony.[25] Initially, the trio was wary about performing, until encouraging words from Robbie Robertson inspired them to try. The end result was an incendiary set consisting of ""Sunshine of Your Love"", ""Crossroads"", and - interestingly, as the band had never played it live during their original tenure - ""Born Under a Bad Sign"". Clapton mentioned in his acceptance speech that their rehearsal the day before the ceremony had marked the first time they had played together in 25 years.[4]

The performance spurred rumours of a reunion tour. Bruce and Baker went so far as to say in later interviews that they were, indeed, interested in touring as Cream. A formal reunion did not take place immediately, however, and Clapton continued to pursue solo projects, as did Bruce and Baker, although the two did work together again in the mid-1990s as two-thirds of a power trio, BBM, with Gary Moore.

In 2004, it was officially announced that Cream would finally reunite for a series of four shows, on 2, 3, 5, and 6 May 2005 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, the venue of their final concerts in 1968. Even more surprising was that the reunion came at Clapton's request: although the three musicians chose not to speak publicly about the shows, Clapton would later state that he had become more ""generous"" in regard to his past, and that the physical health of Bruce and Baker was a major factor: Bruce had recently undergone a liver transplant for liver cancer, and had almost lost his life, while Baker had severe arthritis.

Tickets for all four shows sold out in under an hour. Touts were soon charging outrageous prices for what became one of the hardest-to-get tickets in rock and roll history. The performances were recorded for a live CD and DVD. Among those in attendance were Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, Steve Winwood, Roger Waters, Brian May of Queen, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin and also Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman, formerly of the Rolling Stones. The reunion marked the first time the band had played ""Badge"" and ""Pressed Rat and Warthog"" live.

The Royal Albert Hall reunion proved a success on both a personal and financial level, inspiring the reformed band to bring their reunion to the United States. For reasons unknown, Cream chose to play at only one venue, Madison Square Garden in New York City, from 24-26 October 2005. The shows were marred by some controversy in regard to tickets: the show's promoters had made a deal with credit card company American Express to make tickets available to American Express customers only in an unprecedented week-long pre-sale. Again, touts charged high prices for tickets; nevertheless, the shows were a financial success and received critical praise.

Fans of Cream hoped for a full-scale tour, but a statement from Cream's publicist days after the last performance put the nail in that particular coffin, when it was announced that Cream would not tour the United States. In an interview with Jack Bruce in the December 2005 issue of Bass Player magazine, Bruce hinted that he would like to see Cream continue in one way or another, possibly in the form of a new album, but that a tour was out of the question: ""It would be quite a challenge to try to create music that would stand up to the classic songs. I've got a few ideas already — in fact, I wrote a song yesterday that I think would work. I just don't know if it will happen, because we all feel the band is so special we don't want to do it that often, if we go on. We've had offers you wouldn't believe — I didn't believe — for long world tours, and it's tempting. But none of us wants to accept because it would take away from the rarity and special nature of getting together. I'd like to do it every now and again and just play somewhere, but we could do an album amidst that, and I'm going to suggest it.""

Post-Cream

Later years (1968-present)

Blind Faith came about immediately after the demise of Cream following an attempt by Clapton to recruit Steve Winwood into the band in the hope that he would help act as a buffer between Bruce and Baker. However, Cream broke up before Winwood had the chance to consider the offer.

Inspired by more song-based acts, particularly The Band, Clapton went on to perform much different, less improvisational material with Delaney & Bonnie, Derek and the Dominos and in his own long and varied solo career.

Jack Bruce began a varied and successful solo career with the 1969 release of Songs for a Tailor.

Ginger Baker formed a jazz-fusion ensemble out of the ashes of Blind Faith, Ginger Baker's Air Force, which featured Winwood, Blind Faith bassist Rick Grech, Graham Bond on sax, and Denny Laine of the Moody Blues, among others.

The future (2006-present)

Cream's future is uncertain: in February 2006, Cream received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of their contribution to, and influence upon, modern music. That same month, a ""Classic Albums"" DVD was released detailing the story behind the creation and recording of Disraeli Gears. On the day prior to the Grammy ceremony, Bruce made a public statement that more one-off performances of Cream had been planned: multiple dates in a few cities, similar to the Royal Albert Hall and Madison Square Garden shows. He would not state when or where those shows would occur, claiming that he ""would get chopped"" if he said anything.

However, this story was rebutted by both Clapton and Baker, first by Clapton in a Times article from April 2006. The article stated that when asked about Cream, Clapton said: ""'No. Not for me. We did it and it was fun. But life is too short I've got lots of other things I would rather do, including staying at home with my kids.' The thing about that band, he says, was that it was all to do with its limits. 'Here were three people who were essentially in disagreement with each other. You latched on to those rare moments of cohesion and made the most of them. But they were rare. It was an experiment.'""

In an interview regarding the release of a DVD of Blind Faith's 1969 performance in Hyde Park, Baker commented to the United Kingdom-based magazine Music Mart about his unwillingness to continue the Cream reunion. These comments were far more specific and explosive than Clapton's; his reasons stemmed from Jack Bruce's behaviour at the Madison Square Garden performances: ""When he's Dr. Jekyll, he's fine... It's when he's Mr. Hyde that he's not. And I'm afraid he's still the same. I tell you this - there won't ever be any more Cream gigs, because he did Mr. Hyde in New York last year.""

When asked to elaborate, Baker replied: ""Oh, he shouted at me on stage, he turned his bass up so loud that he deafened me on the first gig. What he does is that he apologises and apologises, but I'm afraid, to do it on a Cream reunion gig, that was the end. He killed the magic, and New York was like 1968... It was just a get through the gig, get the money sort of deal. I was absolutely amased. I mean, he demonstrated why he got the sack from Graham Bond and why Cream didn't last very long on stage in New York. I didn't want to do it in the first place simply because of how Jack was. I have worked with him several times since Cream, and I promised myself that I would never work with him again. When Eric first came up with the idea, I said no, and then he phoned me up and eventually convinced me to do it. I was on my best behaviour and I did everything I could to make things go as smooth as possible, and I was really pleasant to Jack.""

Clapton would later expand on his reasons for ending the reunion: Baker's response to Bruce's attitude on the first night of the New York shows. Believing that the two would never see eye-to-eye almost forty years after the break-up of Cream, he chose to return to the path of solo artist. Surprisingly, despite the negative comments from Baker regarding Madison Square Garden, Jack Bruce told Detroit's WCSX radio station in May 2007 that there are plans for a Cream reunion later in the year: ""There is some talk about us getting together later this year, which I can't really say too much about. But it's not a commercial thing ... but we may get together for something.""

It was later revealed that the potential performance was to be a set at the November, 2007 London tribute to Ahmet Ertegün. The band decided against it, as was confirmed by Bruce in a letter to the editor of the Jack Bruce fanzine, The Cuicoland Express dated 26 September 2007:

    ""Dear Marc,
    We were going to do this tribute concert for Ahmet when it was to be at the Royal Albert Hall but decided to pass when it was moved to the O2 Arena and seemed to be becoming overly commercial.""

The headlining act for the O2 Arena Ertegun tribute show (postponed to December 2007) turned out to be another reunited English hard-rock act, Led Zeppelin. So while the band members are talking again, no Cream reunions are planned for the near future. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cream"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Animals,"The Animals were a British rock band of the 1960s, formed in Newcastle. They were part of the British Invasion, being one of the most popular bands of their era. Known for their gritty, raw, bluesy sound and hard-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature songs House of the Rising Sun and Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood, the band underwent numerous personnel changes, while influencing the later heavy metal music with the riffs of their rock songs such as We Gotta Get Out Of This Place and It's my Life. They emerged as an exponent of psychedelic music before dissolving at the end of the decade. In 1983 they had a comeback and toured for six months before disbanding forever.

History
First incarnation

Formed in Newcastle-upon-Tyne during 1962 and 1963 when Burdon joined the existing Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo, the original line-up comprised Eric Burdon (vocals), Alan Price (organ and keyboards), Hilton Valentine (guitar), John Steel (drums), and Bryan ""Chas"" Chandler (bass). The Animals' moderate success in their hometown and a connection with The Yardbirds manager Giorgio Gomelsky motivated them to move to London in 1964, in time to be grouped with the British Invasion. They performed fiery versions of the staple rhythm and blues repertoire (Jimmy Reed, John Lee Hooker, Nina Simone, etc). Signed to the Columbia Graphophone subsidiary of EMI, a rocking version of the standard ""Baby Let Me Follow You Down"" (retitled Baby Let Me Take You Home) was their first UK hit single.

It was followed in June 1964 by the huge transatlantic hit ""House of the Rising Sun"". Burdon's howling vocals and the dramatic arrangement created arguably the first folk rock hit. Whether the arrangement was inspired by Bob Dylan's version of the song (which in turn was inspired by folk singer Dave Van Ronk) or by blues singer Josh White's (who recorded it twice in 1944 and 1949) or by singer/pianist Nina Simone (who recorded it in 1962 on At The Village Gate, predating Dylan's interpretation) remains a subject of dispute, as does whether all five Animals deserved credit for the arrangement and not just Price.

The Animals' two-year chart career, masterminded by producer Mickie Most, featured singles that were intense, gritty pop covers such as Sam Cooke's Bring It On Home To Me and the Nina Simone number Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood. In contrast their album tracks stayed with rhythm and blues, with Hooker's Boom Boom and Ray Charles' I Believe to My Soul being notable examples. Burdon's powerful, deep voice and the use of keyboards as much or more than guitars were two elements that made the Animals' sound stand out.

By May 1965 the group was starting to feel internal pressures. Price left due to personal and musical differences as well as a fear of flying on tour; he went on to a successful career as a solo artist and with the Alan Price Set. Mickey Gallagher filled in for him on keyboards for a spell, until Dave Rowberry replaced him and was on hand for the hit working-class anthems We Gotta Get Out of this Place and It's My Life. Around that time, an Animals Big Band even made a one-time appearance.

Many of The Animals' hits had come from Brill Building songwriters recruited by Most; the group, and Burdon in particular, felt this was too restrictive. As 1965 ended the group switched to Decca Records and producer Tom Wilson, who gave them more artistic freedom. In early 1966 MGM Records, their American label, collected their hits onto The Best of The Animals; it became their best-selling album in the U.S. In February 1966 Steel left and was replaced by Barry Jenkins; a leftover cover of Goffin-King's Don't Bring Me Down and the powerful hard rock tune See See Rider were the last hits as The Animals.

By this time their business affairs ""were in a total shambles,"" according to Chandler (who would go on to manage Jimi Hendrix), and the group disbanded. Even by the standards of the day, when artists tended to be financially naïve, the Animals made very little money from their successes, eventually claiming mismanagement and theft on the part of their manager Mike Jeffery.

Second incarnation

A group with Burdon, Jenkins, and new sidemen John Weider (guitar/violin/bass), Vic Briggs alias Antion (guitar/piano), and Danny McCulloch (bass) was formed under the name Eric Burdon and the New Animals (or sometimes just Eric Burdon & the Animals) in October 1966, and changed direction. The hard-driving blues was transformed into Burdon's version of psychedelia, as the former heavy-drinking Geordie (who later said he could never get used to Newcastle, ""where the rain comes at you sideways"") relocated to California and became a spokesman for the Love Generation, but also a former heavy metal act and one of the upcoming stars of the genre such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple..

Some of this group's hits included ""San Franciscan Nights"", ""Monterey"" (a tribute to the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival), and the anti-war ""Sky Pilot"". There were further changes to this line-up: George Bruno (a/k/a Zoot Money, keyboards) was added in April 1968, and in July 1968 Andy Summers [sic] (guitar)—later of The Police—replaced Briggs and McCulloch.

By 1969 these Animals had dissolved, and Eric Burdon joined forces with a Latin group from Long Beach, California called War.
The first hit under Eric Burdon & War was the funky/chill-out song Spill the Wine. The Group with 8 members disbanded in July 1971.

Later incarnations

The original Animals line-up of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler, and Steel briefly reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968, for an album in 1977 and again for an album and tour (supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards and Steve Grant on guitar) in 1983. Chandler died in 1996.

In the 2000s Burdon has toured with a new set of musicians under the name ""Eric Burdon and the Animals"". Periodically during the 1990s and 2000s Valentine, Steel, and Dave Rowberry toured under the name ""(Hilton Valentine's) The Animals"" and Valentine and Steel under the name ""Animals II"". Rowberry died in 2003. As of 2005 ""Animals & Friends"" was also active, consisting of Steel and Mickey Gallagher; this group frequently play gigs on a Color Line ship that travels between Scandinavia and Germany.

Legacy

The original Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. Their influence can be heard in artists as varied as The Doors, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Canned Heat, David Johansen, Joe Cocker, Fine Young Cannibals, Iggy Pop, Mando Diao and many, many more. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Animals"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Backstreet Boys,"The Backstreet Boys, or BSB, is a boy band and pop group that rose to popularity in the late 1990s. Since then they have broken music and concert sale records, having sold more than 180 million albums (38 million in the United States.) to make them the highest-selling boy band on record. The group originally consisted of Nick Carter, Howard Dwaine 'Howie' Dorough, Brian Littrell,  Kevin Richardson, and AJ McLean.

Their debut album, Backstreet Boys, was released in 1996. The album debuted at #1 in Germany, Norway, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Finland, Austria, and Canada and sold over 38 million copies worldwide (14 million copies in the U.S.) setting a record for the most successful debut album in history. In some countries, they've also released a second album, Backstreet's Back. In May 1999, the Backstreet Boys released the album Millennium, which sold over 1.13 million units in its first week, setting a record for most albums sold in the first week of release. They also held the most sales for an album's second and third weeks. The record dominated the worldwide charts, landing at the #1 spot in 25 countries. The album was certified 11 times platinum by December 1999, making it the fastest selling album in a year. The album went on to sell over 43 million copies worldwide. Released in November 2000, their album Black & Blue, whose 13-song selection features five songs co-written by members of the group, plus two songs written by all five Backstreet Boys, achieved platinum status in over 30 countries and gold certification in 10 regions around the world during its first week of release with sales of over 25 million copies worldwide.  

In October 2001, the boys released The Hits: Chapter One, a disc of their greatest hits and Drowning, their last single until their return in 2005. After a five-year hiatus, their new single, Incomplete, was released to radio stations on March 28, 2005 and quickly became the #1 most requested song in top markets in both U.S. and overseas. The song was a drastic change from their previous albums, switching to adult contemporary rather than pop.

Destiny's Child,"Destiny's Child was a Grammy-Award winning American R&B girl group comprising lead singer Beyoncé Knowles alongside Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. Formed in 1997 in Houston, Texas, Destiny's Child members began their musical endeavors in their pre-teens under the name Girls' Tyme, comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett. After years of performing underground, they signed to Columbia Records and changed their name. Destiny's Child was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall, which contained the number-one singles ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" and ""Say My Name"".

Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett attempted to split off the group's manager Mathew Knowles. They were soon replaced with Williams and Farrah Franklin; however, in 2000, Franklin also parted with the group, leaving them as a trio. Their third album, Survivor, which contains themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, contains the worldwide hits ""Independent Women"", ""Survivor"" and ""Bootylicious"". In 2002, Destiny's Child announced a hiatus, allowing its members to attain individual success. They re-united with 2004's Destiny Fulfilled, and a year later during their world tour, announced that the group would disband and its members would pursue solo careers.

Throughout their career, the group released four major studio albums and achieved four US number-one singles. They had sold over 50 million records worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling recording artists in the U.S. Billboard magazine ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time, and inducted the group in 2008 into the All time Hot 100 Artist. In 2005, the World Music Awards recognized them as the World's Best-selling female group of all time.

The group made their recording debut with ""Killing Time,"" which appeared on the soundtrack for the 1997 blockbuster, Men In Black. Destiny's Child released their self-titled debut album to mixed reviews on February 17, 1998. The album's first single, ""No, No, No"" featured two completely different versions of the same song. ""No, No, No Pt.1"" and ""No, No, No Pt.2"" were both released simultaneously, however, Part II was considered a ""remix"" version of Part I. ""No, No, No Pt.2"" featuring The Fugees member Wyclef Jean, quickly climbed to No.1 on the Billboard R&B chart and No.3 Pop. The blockbuster single sold over 1 million copies, turning the group into an instant R&B music sensation. However, follow-up singles ""With Me Pt.1"" (which also had two different versions) and ""Get On The Bus"" failed to reproduce the blockbuster success of ""No, No, No."" Destiny's Child eventually went Platinum after later success. Expectations weren't high for the group's second album, as most industry critics considered them to be another disposable R&B girl-group with one-hit wonder status.

Destiny's Child re-entered the studio quickly, bringing in an impressive lineup of talented producers, including Kevin ""She'kspere"" Briggs, Rodney Jerkins, Dwayne Wiggins, Chad Elliot, Daryl Simmons, and Missy Elliott. Critics were generally positive about the album. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote ""The Writing's On The Wall... an assured step forward for the girl group. Not only are they maturing as vocalists, they are fortunate to work with such skilled, talented producers... who all give the quartet rich, varied music upon which to work their charm."" Lead single ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" became the group's first No.1 pop hit (and second R&B No.1) in the summer of 1999, and paced by its success, the accompanying album, The Writing's on the Wall, entered the charts at No.6 upon its release on July 27, 1999. The second single, ""Bug-a-Boo"" hit the Top 40 pop charts, while its music video received heavy rotation on MTV and BET.

Buoyed by the group's breakout success, two of its original members, Letoya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, attempted to split with manager Matthew Knowles, charging that he kept a disproportionate share of the band's profits, attempted to exert too much control, and unfairly favored Beyonce and Kelly (who is widely believed to be Beyonce's cousin - they are not blood relations). While they never intended to leave the group, relations naturally grew strained, and when the video for ""Say My Name"" premiered in February 2000, many fans (not to mention Roberson and Luckett) were surprised to find two new members — Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin — joining Knowles and Rowland. Infuriated, Roberson and Luckett took legal action in March, suing both Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties. A war of words followed in the press; meanwhile, Destiny's Child became a pop-cultural phenomenon. ""Say My Name"" was the group's most irresistible and biggest single to date, becoming the group's third No.1 single. The abrupt membership changes within the group seemed to only heighten the group's visibility, finally separating them from the endless pack of teen R&B starlets.

In June 2000, the album's fourth single, ""Jumpin' Jumpin'"" became a Top 5 hit, however, another departure came from the ever-evolving girl-group. Farrah Franklin, who had replaced an original member just five months prior, left the group for various personal reasons. This split was less controversial, while The Writing's On The Wall would eventually sell a massive 9 million copies by the end of summer. In the meantime, toward the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Rowland and Knowles in exchange for a settlement, though they continued to pursue action against Knowles' father; as part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from attacking each other publicly.

Now reduced to a trio, Destiny's Child was tapped to record the theme song for the film version of Charlie's Angels; released as a single in October, ""Independent Women, Pt. 1"" raced up the charts and spent an astounding 11 consecutive weeks at number one. Destiny's Child were now indisputable superstars, among the biggest female pop groups, and they quickly began work on a new album to capitalize on their success. In the meantime, Destiny's Child won 2 Grammy awards for ""Say My Name,"" including Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group and Best R&B Song. While speaking with MTV.com, Rowland had this to say about the upcoming album: ""I know everybody can relate to this album — it's very diverse and inspiring. The year 2000 was very challenging, and I know that gave Beyoncé a lot of inspiration to write songs for the album. We cannot wait for everybody to hear it. It's so empowering for a lot of people who have already heard a little bit of it.""

Beyoncé had long since emerged as the group's focal point, and on the third Destiny's Child album, she assumed more control than ever before, taking a greater hand in writing the material and even producing and co-writing the entire album. ""We're excited about the album,"" Knowles told MTV News shortly before the album's release. She adds,""...I got a chance to co-write and produce all of the songs."" ""And she did an incredible job,"" the group's Kelly Rowland added. ""But everybody is a part of the music,"" Knowles said. ""Everybody is singing lead on every song, and it's so great — because now Destiny's Child is at the point vocally and mentally that it should be at. It's just great to be a part of this group."" Survivor — whose title was reportedly inspired by a DJ's crack about Destiny's Child members voting one another off the island, much like the popular CBS reality series Survivor — hit stores in the spring of 2001, and entered the charts at number one, selling over 663,000 copies in its first week sales (the highest ever for a girl-group.) The first two singles, ""Survivor"" and ""Bootylicious"", were predictably huge hits, with the latter becoming the group's fourth No.1 pop single. A cover of Andy Gibb's ""Emotion"" was also successful, becoming a Top 10 pop hit. Survivor sold well — over twelve million copies — more than its predecessor. Toward the end of the year, the group released a holiday album, 8 Days of Christmas, and announced plans for a series of side projects, including solo albums from all three members (to be staggered over the next year and a half, so as to avoid competition). In early 2002, a remix compilation titled This Is the Remix was released to tide fans over.

After three years apart, achieving individual success in movies, on Broadway, endorsements and with solo albums, the three women of Destiny's Child reunited with a brand new album, Destiny Fulfilled. Destiny Fulfilled was executive produced and co-written by all three members. ""Lose My Breath,"" the album's first single, produced by Rodney Jerkins, became the group's ninth Top 10 pop hit. The album was released in November 2004. The second single, ""Soldier"" featuring rappers T.I. and Lil' Wayne quickly entered the Top 10, peaking at No.3 in February 2005 becoming the groups 10th top 10 pop hit. Despite receiving worldwide mixed reviews, Destiny Fulfilled was certified 3x Platinum in early 2005. The album's third US single was ""Cater 2 U,"" while the international release was ""Girl"". 

""Stand Up For Love"" was released as Destiny's Child's last single from their greatest hits album, #1's, released on October 25, 2005.

Destiny's Child reunited for a farewell performance at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game on February 19 in Houston, Texas; however, Knowles commented, ""It's the last album, but it's not the last show."" Their final televised performance was at the Fashion Rocks benefit concert in New York at the same month. On March 28, 2006, Destiny's Child was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the 2,035th recipient of the coveted recognition. At the 2006 BET Awards, Destiny's Child won Best Group, a category they also earned in 2005 and 2001.

The Associated Press reported in October 2012 that Destiny's Child was a potential collaborator during Beyoncé's performance at Super Bowl XLVII, set to take place February 3, 2013, following the release of the group's second compilation album Playlist: The Very Best of Destiny's Child. It was essentially a re-release of their first with a difference of four songs and an updated track-listing. On January 10,  2013, Beyoncé announced that the group would release its third compilation album titled Love Songs later that month on January 29. This album differs from the first two compilations in that it features mostly album-only selections as well as the newly recorded song ""Nuclear."" The next day, Legacy Recordings, which is responsible for the release of Playlist and Love Songs, posted ""Nuclear"" on the group's official SoundCloud account, jointly with Mashable.com, where the song was posted along with a message reading, ""Sony Music has exclusively given Mashable the audio for ""Nuclear,"" the first song from Destiny's Child since the group broke up in 2005.""During the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, the members of Destiny's Child performed ""Bootylicious"", ""Independent Women"" and Knowles' ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Destiny%27s+Child"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Alice Cooper,"Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier, February 4, 1948) is an American rock singer, songwriter, and musician whose career spans five decades. With a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, boa constrictors, and baby dolls, he is considered by fans and peers alike to be ""The Godfather of Shock Rock""; Cooper has drawn equally from horror movies, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a grandly theatrical and macabre brand of rock designed to shock.

Originating in Phoenix in the late 1960s after Furnier moved from Detroit, Alice Cooper was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar, Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar, and drummer Neal Smith. The original Alice Cooper band broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit ""I'm Eighteen"" from the album Love It to Death, which was followed by the even bigger single ""School's Out"" in 1972 which reached No 1 in the UK. The band reached their commercial peak with the  1973 album Billion Dollar Babies.

Furnier adopted the band's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare. In 2011 he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare, his 19th album as a solo artist, and his 26th album in total. Expanding from his Detroit rock roots, in his career Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles, including conceptual rock, art rock, hard rock, heavy metal, new wave, pop rock, experimental rock and industrial rock. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Alice+Cooper"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Goo Goo Dolls,"Goo Goo Dolls is an alternative rock band formed in 1985 in Buffalo, New York, USA by guitarist/vocalist John Rzeznik and bassist/vocalist Robby Takac initially under the name the Sex Maggots (the new name was chosen from an ad in True Detective magazine at the behest of a local club owner). They are most famous for the hit ""Iris"", featured on the soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels. Currently, the band consists of John Rzeznik (guitar, vocals), Robby Takac (vocals, bass) and Mike Malinin (drums).

Early in their career, the Goo Goo Dolls were frequently dismissed by critics as mere imitators of The Replacements; however, the band refined its sound to be more mainstream, which helped it become one of the most popular adult alternative rock bands of the latter half of the '90s, selling millions of records to audiences largely unfamiliar with their inspirations. That's no bitch on the band, either -- their music simply improved in craft and accessibility as the years progressed, and radio happened to be receptive to what a decade earlier would have been considered collegiate power pop. Thus, the band landed two huge hits with the acoustic ballads ""Name"" and ""Iris.""

Originally a cover band with a taste for power pop and classic rock & roll, the group soon began writing its own songs. Their early sound recalled the The Replacements' origins as a bratty punk band (circa Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash) -- melodic, snotty, and a little bit thrashy. That sound was the reason the band attracted the interest of the heavy metal label Metal Blade, which issued their debut album in 1987 (known either as The Goo Goo girls or First Release). 1989's Jed continued in a similar vein; the college radio breakthrough came with 1990's Hold Me Up, a Replacements-ish power pop record.

1993's Superstar Car Wash was the Goo Goo Dolls' artistic breakthrough; though it did nothing to quell the Replacements comparisons, it was a finely crafted pop/rock record, and its lead single, ""We Are the Normal,"" was co-written with Replacements leader Paul Westerberg himself. Still, Superstar Car Wash wasn't the commercial force the band hoped it would be, especially in light of the success of similar bands like the Gin Blossoms. That all changed with 1995's A Boy Named Goo, when an L.A. rock station put the acoustic-driven ballad ""Name"" into heavy rotation. It was eventually released as a single nationwide, and went Top Five late in the year; platinum sales for the album followed close behind. Unfortunately, the original drummer was no longer around to enjoy the band's success; prior to the album's release, he'd been sacked and replaced by drummer Mike Malinin.

Dissatisfied with the royalty rates in their Metal Blade contract, the band waged a legal battle that wound up allowing them to jump to parent company Warner Brothers. Somewhat drained, Rzeznik and the band shook off a case of writer's block to contribute the ballad ""Iris"" to the soundtrack of the 1998 americanized version of City of Angels (Featuring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan). Appearing that April, the song was a monster smash, although it was never released as a single (so its official Top Ten pop chart status doesn't convey how popular it was); for a better indicator, ""Iris"" spent nearly a year on Billboard's airplay charts, including an astonishing 18 weeks at number one, and was nominated for three Grammys. The band's next album, Dizzy Up the Girl, was released in September, during the middle of ""Iris""'s marathon airplay run, and sold over three million copies. Its clean, polished sound completed the Goo Goo Dolls' transformation into mainstream pop/rockers who happened to have alternative roots. Further hits from the record followed over the next year, including ""Slide,"" ""Dizzy,"" and the Grammy-nominated ""Black Balloon,"" and the band toured heavily in support. The Goo Goo Dolls revamped their sound for 2001's career retrospective, Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce. A year later, the trio hit the charts with ""Here Is Gone"" from their seventh studio album, Gutterflower. The CD/DVD combo Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004 helped fans endure the long wait for the band's next studio album, Let Love In, which didn't appear until 2006. The band toured through the summer of 2007. The band released the first of two greatest hits compilation, entitled Greatest Hits Volume One: The Singles, November 13th 2007. 

In February 2008, the band officially headed into studio to work on their new record.
In August 2010, the band released their newest album, Something for the Rest of Us.

Yellowcard,"Yellowcard is a multi-platinum selling pop punk band from Jacksonville, Florida, USA. Their latest work Lift A Sail was released via Razor & Tie on October 7th, 2014.

Their music features a rare contribution to the genre, incorporating the use of a violin. Formed in 1997, the current line up consists of Ryan Key (vocals, rhythm guitar), Ryan Mendez (lead guitar, vocals), Sean Mackin (violin, vocals), Nathan Young on drums, and Josh Portman on bass.
  
Yellowcard was formed in 1997 in Jacksonville, Florida, USA after meeting at Douglas Anderson School of the Arts. The band was made up of six members back then: 

Ben Dobson (1997 - 2000) : vocals, Todd Clarry (1997 - 2001) : guitar, vocals, Sean Mackin (1997 - present) : violin, vocals, Warren Cooke (1997 - 2002) : bass, Ben Harper (not the same as Ben Harper) (1997 - 2005) : guitar, Longineu W. Parsons III (1997 - present) : drums.

Former members: Ben Dobson (1997 - 2000) : vocals,  Todd Clarry (1997 - 2001) : guitar, vocals, Warren Cooke (1997 - 2002) : bass, Alex Lewis (2003 - 2004) : bass, backing vocals, Ben Harper (1997 - 2005) : lead guitar, Peter Mosely (2002 - 2003, 2004 - 2007) : bass, vocals, Sean O'Donnell of Reeve Oliver(2010–2012) : bass guitar, backing vocals

The band released their first album, Midget Tossing, in 1997 but with not much success.

Around that time their lead singer was replaced by Ryan Key who convinced the band that they couldn't be successful in Florida, so they decided to move to Southern California.

The new group released their debut album, One for the Kids (Lobster Records), in 2001, and followed up with The Underdog EP (Fueled by Ramen Records) in 2002.

Yellowcard signed with Capitol Records in 2003 and released Ocean Avenue, which is their most successful album to date.

Soon after, bassist Alex Lewis was let go by the band. Pete Mosely who had produced and played bass on most of the songs on Ocean Avenue took over on bass.

The Yellowcard popularity ""skyrocketed"" after this period, with a song from their Ocean Avenue Album, ""Breathing"" appearing on EA Games' famed title, Burnout 3: Takedown in the winter of 2004. The song was very popular among users of the game, which had previously been owned by the British company Criterion, but had been acquired by EA. People from across the world began to sample the Yellowcard fanaticism that people had over the times previous.  

The album Lights and Sounds was released in January 2006. The title track, Lights and Sounds, was the first single released off the album. It is also featured on the game Burnout Revenge. The whole album is based on a concept theme with many songs expressing their dislike for Los Angeles. Lights and Sounds also features a special guest appearance of Dixie Chick Natalie Maines on How I Go. 


In 2005 the guitarist Ben Harper left the band due to disputes.He chose to work with his record label TAKEOVER RECORDS and has signed bands since his departure.  He did do some guitar work for Lights and Sounds which is still in the songs on the album. He was replaced by Ryan Mendez (formerly of Staring Back) shortly before the Lights & Sounds tour began.

Paper Walls is their latest album released July 17th, 2007. Light Up the Sky is the first track released off this album. The title track from this album sees Yellowcard reach new levels and shows the depth they have grown to. After their tour for Paper Walls in 2008, they went on an indefinite hiatus for almost 2 years. They have since come back from their indefinite hiatus and recorded the new album, When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes.

On August 1, 2010, it was confirmed that Yellowcard is back, working on a new record. When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes, was released on March 22nd, 2011 via Hopeless Records.

Later they then came back and released Southern Air in 2012. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Yellowcard"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Cyndi Lauper,"Cyndi Lauper (born Cynthia Ann Stephanie Lauper on June 22, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York, United States), is a Grammy Award-winning singer (who possesses a four-octave vocal range) and Emmy Award-winning film, television and theatre actress. She was lead singer of the rockabilly band Blue Angel before her rise to fame as a solo singer. Her melodic voice and wild costumes have come to epitomize the 1980s and New Wave — the decade and genre in which she first came to fame.

Born in Queens, New York to Swiss German-American Fred Lauper and Sicilian Italian-American Catrine Dominique, she began her career in a cover band, but soon began performing her own songs (though she almost quit singing altogether due to strained vocal chords in 1977). By 1980 she'd released a rockabilly album on Polydor with the band Blue Angel. Despite much critical acclaim, the album ""went lead,"" as Lauper says, and the band split as Lauper filed for bankruptcy.

In 1983 she started dating her manager David Wolff with whom she released She's So Unusual, a worldwide hit album which made Lauper a household name. A mixture of teen-friendly pop-rock and edgier, almost punky sounds, the album's biggest hit, Girls Just Want to Have Fun, quickly established itself as a female anthem. Lauper won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards of 1984 for her work on the album. Lauper was the first female artist to have four consecutive Hot 100 Top 5 hits from one album.

Subsequent albums (such as True Colors, A Night to Remember, Hat Full of Stars) did not sell as well, but Lauper remains active to the present day and still retains a very strong fan base.

Lauper's latest album Memphis Blues was released in June 2011, premiering at #1 on the Billboard Blues Album Chart where it remained for 14 consecutive weeks.  The album also reached #26 on the Billboard Top 200, and was later named the Billboard Blues Album of the year, also earning Lauper a Grammy nomination. This brought her total Grammy nominations to 13 with one win.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cyndi+Lauper"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Meshuggah,"Meshuggah, whose name is taken from the Hebrew and Yiddish word for “crazy”, is a five-piece band from Umeå, Sweden, founded in 1987. The band's style is most easily described as extreme/technical metal with some jazz influence. They use extended polymetric passages, polyrhythmic drum patterns, angular, dissonant guitar riffs, and harsh vocals. Their lineup has always been consistent, apart from bass which has been handled by many people since the band’s inception. Their current lineup consists of Jens Kidman (vocals), Fredrik Thordendal (lead/rhythm guitar + backup vocals), Mårten Hagström (rhythm guitar + backup vocals), Dick Lövgren (bass) and Tomas Haake (drums).

Meshuggah is widely acknowledged as an influence on many modern metal bands from Textures to Tool. They are regarded as pioneers by critics and musicians alike.

Band history

Meshuggah was formed in Umeå in 1987; two years later, the band released their first record, an EP entitled Psykisk Testbild (which can be roughly translated as ""Psychological test image"". This recording displayed a straightforward thrash metal influenced sound, with some strains along the lines of Metallica's concurrent releases. There were also hints of more complex music in the songwriting. As the group grew older, they further refined the technicality of their musicianship and songwriting. This led to a harsher sound, utilizing strong seven string guitar (and later eight string guitar) rhythms, manic sounding vocals, and a combination of jazz fusion elements as well. This caused the band's style to border on the lines of an esoteric feel. This style has shown to be hard to appreciate by some but it is widely embraced by Meshuggah fans.

While the band's music is extremely intense and aggressive, the members often demonstrate a strong sense of humour: their video for ""New Millennium Cyanide Christ"" consisted of the five band members sitting inside their tour bus headbanging and air guitaring to the song. Promotional photos of the band often include comical grimacing.

In late 2005, Meshuggah were nominated for a Swedish Grammy for the album Catch Thirty-Three.

Bands such as Dream Theater, God Forbid, Deftones, Textures , Lamb of God, The Safety Fire and Tool have cited Meshuggah as an influence.

Style

Among the band's most recognizable qualities are lead guitar player Fredrik Thordendal's abrasive, chaotic and dischordant solos, singer Jens Kidman's vocals, which resemble manic screams and shouts; the churning, dissonant rhythm guitars and the polymetric drum beats. In a typical Meshuggah song, drummer Tomas Haake plays two separate rhythms: a standard 4/4 beat with his hands, and a completely different metrical subdivision with his feet. The guitars mostly follow the bass drum work, creating an awkwardly pulsating rhythmic pattern to work as the basis of the song.

To give an example, the main riff of the song ""New Millennium Cyanide Christ"" from their 1998 album Chaosphere follows the aforementioned blueprint. Haake beats a rather slow 4/4 rhythm with his hands, while the bass drums and guitars play a repetitive 23/16 rhythm pattern on top of it. As the subdivided pattern is repeated, the pattern's accents shift to different beats on each repetition. After repeating the 23/16 pattern five times, a shorter 13/16 pattern is played once. These patterns sum up to 128 16th notes, which equals exactly 8 measures in 4/4 meter.

The band has evolved through a number of stylisitic periods. Contradictions Collapse and None have a sound similar to Metallica's concurrent albums. Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere have a more distinct off-time influence along with the thrash metal sound. Nothing and Catch Thirty-Three have a sound close to the vein of groove metal, consisting of droning and slow grooves.

While live drums were obviously not abandoned, a unique decision was made to use programmed drum patterns using Toontrack's ""Drumkit From Hell"" (developed in co-operation with Tomas Haake and Morgan Ågren) sample library on the latest album Catch Thirty-Three, not only providing a more precise and mechanized drumscape, but also making drum beat creativity a more collaborative effort amongst all of the band members. It cemented the album as one of the band's most complex works to date. The band members have, however, stated in several interviews that the decision to use programmed drums was due to the lack of time given by their label to produce the record.

On all records since Nothing, guitarists Thordendal and Hagström use custom-made Nevborn, and custom Ibanez eight string guitars. These guitars add two low strings to allow the crushing, heavy riffs to be played in even lower registers. They currently use Line 6's Vetta II Amps.

In regards to lyrics, the main lyricist of Meshuggah is drummer Tomas Haake, who uses vocabulary and metaphorical styling. Through abstract descriptions, Haake tackles such topics as: The self, society, mendaciousness, the human condition, and spatial/4th dimensional concepts. While Haake tends to write the majority of the lyrics, guitarist Mårten Hagström also contributes to certain songs. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Meshuggah"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Frédéric Chopin,"Fryderyk François Chopin (1810 –1849) is one of the most famous, influential, and admired composers and virtuoso pianists of the Romantic era.

He was born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin, of Polish and French parentage, on 1st March 1810 in the village of Żelazowa Wola, Poland. In Warsaw he was hailed as a child prodigy and as the ""second Mozart"" for his piano and composition skill, for which the composer Robert Schumann complimented the talented pianist: ""Hats off, gentlemen, a genius!"" Due to the political situation in Poland, he left his country for France at the age of twenty. There he composed his two piano concertos with their patriotic Polish themes and rhythms, based on traditional Polish dances. He never returned to Poland, but after his death his sister Ludwika took his heart to Poland - in accordance with his last will, where it was placed inside a pillar of the Holy Cross Church at Krakowskie Przedmiescie Street.

In Paris, he made a career as a performer and teacher as well as a composer, and he adopted the French variant of his name, ""Frédéric-François"". In 1836 he met the French writer George Sand, with whom he had a relationship for nine years until 1847. He suffered poor health for much of his life and this forced him to give up performing and teaching shortly before he died on 17th October 1849.

His compositions, which are almost exclusively for the piano, such as the Funeral March piano sonata and the twenty-seven études (op. 10 and op. 25, plus a further set of three without opus numbers), are widely considered to be amongst the pinnacles of the piano repertoire. Although some of his music is among the most technically demanding for the instrument, Chopin's style emphasises poetry, nuance, and expressive depth, rather than mere technical display. He is often cited as one of the mainstays of Romanticism in nineteenth-century classical music.

J. Cole,"Jermaine Lamarr Cole (born January 28, 1985 in Frankfurt, Germany), better known simply as J. Cole, is an American rapper and producer from Fayetteville, North Carolina. He is best known for being the first artist to be signed to Jay-Z's label Roc Nation after Jay heard his single Lights Please. He released his debut mixtape The Come Up in 2007 and followed this up with 2009's The Warm Up and 2010's Friday Night Lights. Songfacts reports that he dropped his first official single, Work Out on June 15, 2011, the two-year anniversary of The Warm Up.  He released his highly anticipated debut album ""Cole World: The Sideline Story"" on Tuesday, September 27, 2011. It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 with approximately 218,000 units sold.

Cole has appeared on the cover of The Source and Beyond Race magazines, as well as being featured as one of XXL’s 2010 Freshmen. Cole appeared on Jay-Z’s 2009 album The Blueprint 3, on the track A Star is Born, and is also featured on labelmate Wale’s debut album, Attention Deficit. Most recently, he was touring with Jay-Z, Young Jeezy, and Trey Songz on The Blueprint 3 tour. In January 2010, along with Jay Electronica and Mos Def, he appeared on the first single from the new Reflection Eternal album, Just Begun.

The rap world is at a crossroads. In the face of shrinking budgets, music executives, resting on their laurels, search out the next YouTube sensation with a catchy hook and dance move in order to amass digital single sales. While many artists have tried to break through despite an industry melt down, few have been met with critical praise. And the applause for those that have has not been loud enough to sway the course of the current rap market. Looking to excel where his contemporaries have failed, North Carolina native J. Cole (born Jermaine Cole) brings promise of a new day in hip hop music.Raised by his mother in North Carolina, J. Cole's hometown of Fayetteville would provide much of the sights and experiences that would come to shape his sound. Cole fell into rapping at the age of 12 when his cousin from Louisiana spent the summer in Fayetteville, showing him the basics of rhyming. He was instantly hooked. From there he delved deep into the music of hip hop luminaries including Tupac Shakur, Nas and Outkast, taking from them a love for telling stories with an unbridled rigor. Seizing every opportunity to write, at age 15 J. Cole found himself with composition notebooks full of rhymes but no beats of his own to lay them on. Determined to create original songs, he begged his mother for a beat machine so he could produce music solely for himself. She granted his wish and from there, a young Cole spent all his free time creating sounds and songs that would lay the foundation for what his style has evolved to today.

Feeling the need to be heard, J. Cole used college as a tool to chase his dreams. He attended St. John's University on an academic scholarship, choosing the school so that he could be in the heart of the music industry: New York City. After polishing his sound and graduating Magna Cum Laude, J. Cole is dropping his debut mixtape, properly titled ""The Come Up"" hosted by DJ On Point. A mash up of dusty, soul filled sound beds, raw, energetic drums and an endless range of topics everything from the carefree days of college to the seemingly endless plight of those have-nots scrapping for change. The Come Up puts J. Cole's broad palette of lyrical and production talents on display. ""All a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that, but they rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back,"" he vehemently spits over the cascading keys and triumphant strings of the self produced ""Lil' Ghetto Nigga.""

With such a diverse display, J. Cole is poised to wake up a dormant industry and cement his name in this game. But more than that, with his debut studio album currently in production, he hopes to change the tide of current rap music, swaying it in a more insightful, meaningful and passionate direction."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/J.+Cole"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Stone Temple Pilots,"Stone Temple Pilots (often abbreviated as STP) is a Grammy Award winning American rock band from San Diego, California, that originally consisted of Scott Weiland (lead vocals), brothers Dean (guitar) and Robert DeLeo (bass, backing vocals), and Eric Kretz (drums). Since the band's formation in 1989, its line-up remained unchanged until the dismissal of Weiland in 2013, who was replaced by Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington. In 2015, Bennington left the band to focus solely on Linkin Park. On December 3, 2015, Weiland was found dead on his tour bus prior to a performance with his band The Wildabouts.

After forming in 1989 under the name Mighty Joe Young, the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots. The band found immediate success in 1993 upon releasing their debut album, Core (1992), and went on to become one of the most commercially successful bands of the 1990s.[7] The band released four more studio albums: Purple (1994), Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop (1996), No. 4 (1999) and Shangri-La Dee Da (2001), before separating in 2002, after which the band members partook in various projects (most notably Velvet Revolver and Army of Anyone). The band eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour, released a new self-titled album in 2010, and have been actively touring since, even after Weiland was fired from the band. The band's only material with Bennington was the EP High Rise in 2013.[8]

While initially displaying a sound typically identified as grunge early on in its career, further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova and classic rock. The band's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved several tumultuous periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.

The band's five studio albums have sold over 17 million copies in the United States alone. The band has had fifteen top ten singles on the Billboard rock charts, including six number ones, and one number one album on the pop charts (1994's Purple). In 1993, the band won a Grammy for ""Best Hard Rock Performance"" for their song ""Plush"". Stone Temple Pilots were also ranked at number 40 on VH1's The 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. In 2003, the band released the greatest hits compilation Thank You. Around this time, band members began going their separate ways. After the band's break-up in  2003 , original lead singer Scott Weiland became the frontman of Velvet Revolver with former members of Guns N' Roses. The DeLeo brothers formed the band Army of Anyone with Richard Patrick of the band Filter. Kretz founded Bomb Shelter Studios in Los Angeles.

The band reunited in 2008 after Weiland split from Velvet Revolver, kicking off the tour at the Rock on the Range festival in Columbus, Ohio. The band released their self titled sixth album in 2010.

Editors,"Editors are a British indie rock/post-punk revival band from Birmingham, England, formed by Tom Smith (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Russell Leetch (bass) Ed Lay (drums) and Chris Urbanowicz (guitar)  who met while studying at Staffordshire University, in Stafford, England, United Kingdom during 2002. After Chris' departure in 2012 , Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams joined the band for their live gigs and participated in the recording of the fourth album.

The band were originally known as (The) Pride, before they changed their line-up and became known as Snowfield, becoming a popular unsigned band. They remained with this name until they signed with Kitchenware Records in September 2004. The band's debut single Bullets was released as a limited edition of 500 on Kitchenware Records on January 24, 2005; it quickly gained support from radio stations such as Xfm and BBC 6 Music - where it was the single of the week.

Their debut album, The Back Room, was released on 25 July 2005, to critical acclaim. The band toured out most of 2005, including two jaunts with We Are Scientists. However, after a pivotal support slot on Franz Ferdinand's Arena tour at the end of 2005, it was the re-release of single Munich in January 2006 that propelled them into the top 10 of the UK single's chart. The following May, Editors played three sell-out shows at London's Brixton Academy, and countless gigs worldwide. The album has now sold over 500,000 units.

In June 2007 Editors released a second album, An End has a Start which included the single Smokers Outside The Hospital Doors. This first track was released on June 18th 2007 in the UK, and June 26th in the US, however it was leaked onto the Internet earlier. The album's title track, An End Has A Start was released on September 3rd, The Racing Rats on November 26th, 2007. Following a landmark appearence on The Other Stage at the Glastonbury festival, the album entered at number 1 in the UK album chart. 

'In this Light And On This Evening', the third studio album, was released on October 12th 2009. With the heavy synthesizer sound and industrial ring, the album differed immensely from the earlier work of the band. Tom explained this change as a way for the band to try something completely different. Papillon, the first single, was followed by You Don't Know Love. The third single was Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool. The album was inspired by the city of London, both lyrically as musically and debuted at number 1 in the UK album charts.

On April 16th 2012, during the recording of their fourth studio album with producer Flood, Editors announced that Chris Urbanowicz (guitar) was leaving the band basing the decision entirely upon the band's future musical direction.

‘The Weight Of Your Love’, their fourth studio LP, was released on July 2013. It was preceded by the single 'A ton of love, released in May. This is also the first album to feature new band members Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams. It was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville with producer Jacquire King and mixed by Craig Silvey.

Metric,"Metric is an indie rock/New Wave band formed in 1998 in Toronto, Canada. The band members are Emily Haines (vocals, synths, guitar, tambourine), James Shaw (guitar, synths, theremin, backing vocals), Josh Winstead (bass, synths, backing vocals) and Joules Scott-Key (drums). The band name was inspired after a sound called ""Metric"" that was programmed by Shaw on his keyboard. They were based at various times at Toronto, Montreal, London, NYC and LA.

So far, Metric has released six studio albums: Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? (2003), Live It Out (2005), Grow Up and Blow Away (2007), Fantasies (2009), Synthetica (2012), and Pagans in Vegas (2015).

Besides Metric, Emily Haines and James Shaw also perform with Broken Social Scene. Joules Scott-Key and Joshua Winstead have their own side project, Bang Lime. Emily Haines released her debut album Cut in Half and Also Double in 1996 and two records under the moniker Emily Haines & the Soft Skeleton: the album Knives Don't Have Your Back in 2006 and the 6-track EP What Is Free to a Good Home? in 2007. She also has been a guest on albums by Stars, The Crystal Method, KC Accidental, Delerium, The Stills and Jason Collett.

Emily Haines was born in New Delhi, India and raised since the age of 3 in Peterborough, Ontario. The daughter of poet Paul Haines grew up as a dual citizen of Canada and India. Her father would often make cassettes of rare and eclectic music for his daughter to listen to and her early influences included Carla Bley and Robert Wyatt. By her teens she followed her parents' footsteps by attending the Etobicoke School of the Arts. There she met Amy Millan and Kevin Drew, with whom she would later collaborate in hHead. Haines and Millan briefly formed their first band around 1990 while at ESA and with songs later written and recorded while at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 1992–1993, at Toronto in 1995 and at Concordia University in Montreal in 1995–1996, Haines distributed in 1996 an early effort called Cut in Half and Also Double with a limited number of copies.

James Shaw was born in the UK. He was a student at a Boston music school and was friends with Torquil Campbell, a vocalist who would later form Stars and Chris Seligman, the future synthesizer player of Stars. Torquil had plans to move to New York City and on his suggestion Shaw applied to Juilliard Music School and moved to New York with him. In 1998, Shaw and Torquil returned to Toronto, where Haines met Shaw through mutual friends in the local music scene. Shaw moved to Montreal where Haines was still living and the two worked on filling out each other's projects. The first song made by Shaw and Haines was ""Butcher"" and eventually they had completed in 1998 several other tracks in their home studio, gathered on Mainstream EP, a collection of demos with an overall downtempo and electronic feel.

In the fall of 1998, Shaw moved back to New York City, this time accompanied by Haines, Campbell and Seligman. There they shared a loft in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. During their two-year stay at the loft, Haines and Shaw were erstwhile room mates with future members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Liars and TV on the Radio. 

Haines and Shaw set off to London in early 2000 and signed a publishing deal with Chrysalis Records. With the help of producer Stephen Hague, Metric worked on a new batch of New Wave/electropop drum-machine paced songs that would form the nucleus of their debut album. The effort dubbed Grow Up and Blow Away, revealed a more musically-layered and mature sound than the earlier Mainstream EP. Haines and Shaw completed the album in April 2001 and by this time had found a label for their release, Restless Records. The album was delayed for years by their record label. 

The band performed in New York in early Spring and late Summer 2001, personally circulating handmade CD-R copies of their unreleased music to fans at shows and by mail, eventually giving the music away for free on the internet. Metric at the time was for the most part a studio band and live shows approximated the synthesizer-centered and drum-machine driven sound of the recordings. In the same year they issued a 5-track EP entitled Static Anonymity and two promo singles: ""Grow Up and Blow Away"" and ""Raw Sugar"".

In the winter of 2001, Metric had gained two new bandmates: the drummer Joules Scott-Key (born in Flint, Michigan) and the bass player Joshua Winstead. Joules Scott-Key was attending college in Texas was in town with his friend Joshua Winstead performing in the local music scene. Scott-Key and Winstead had known each other for about a decade and they met Shaw and Haines at the Brooklyn loft and at local performances.

On 2 September 2003, Metric released their first official studio album Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? on Last Gang Records. The album was received with positive reviews and it has gone gold in Canada. They released 2 singles from the album, ""Combat Baby"" and ""Dead Disco"".

On 27 September 2005, the band released their second studio album, Live It Out on Last Gang Records. The album was well received and has since gone twice platinum in Canada, selling over 200,000 units. They issued 4 singles: ""Monster Hospital"", ""Poster of a Girl"", and ""Empty"". The band has toured the world extensively for several years. They also opened for The Rolling Stones in NYC.

On 26 June 2007, Last Gang Records released Metric's 2001 album Grow Up and Blow Away, after purchasing the rights to the album from band's previous label. In 2007 they released a live EP entitled Live at Metropolis followed a year later by a DVD with the same name featuring a concert recorded from Montreal.

On 7 April 2009, Metric released their fourth album Fantasies on their own label, Metric Music International. In the US it debuted at #1 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers and peaked at #76 on the Billboard 200, in Canada it debuted at #13 on the Canadian Albums Chart and peaked at #6 and in Australia, the album debuted at #48. The album received mostly positive reviews and it's their most successful record to date. They released 6 singles: ""Help I'm Alive"", ""Front Row"", ""Gimme Sympathy"", ""Sick Muse"", ""Gold Guns Girls"" and ""Stadium Love"".

Amazon.com listed Fantasies in eleventh in its ""Best Albums of 2009"" list. This album was a shortlisted nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize and also won two Casby Awards, the NXNE favourite new indie release award and favourite new album award. On 18 April 2010, the album won the Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year at the 2010 Awards, as well as the band winning Group of the Year.

On 27 October 2009, Metric released a 5-track EP called Plug In Plug Out containing acoustic versions of five songs from Fantasies. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Metric, along with several other Canadian music acts, came together in Vancouver to re-record K'Naan's song ""Wavin' Flag"" to benefit Haiti in a movement called Young Artists for Haiti. 

In 2010, the band contributed to Twilight: Eclipse movie soundtrack with a song entitled ""Eclipse (All Yours)"". In the same year, a previously unreleased song ""Black Sheep"" was used on the soundtrack of the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. In 2011, Metric issued the live EP iTunes Session.

On 18 September 2015, Metric released their sixth album, Pagans in Vegas.

Simple Minds,"Simple Minds is a Scottish pop and rock band that achieved its greatest worldwide popularity from the mid-80s to the early 90s, still playing to a massive fan-following today. The group, from the South Side of Glasgow, has produced a set of critically acclaimed albums in the early 80s. It also has secured a string of successful hit singles, the best known being their #1 worldwide hit single ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"", from the soundtrack of the John Hughes movie The Breakfast Club and their worldwide hit single ""Alive and Kicking"". The band has sold more than 40 million albums since 1979, breaking to the U.K. Top 40 chart a full 24 times.

Founding members Jim Kerr (vocals) and Charlie Burchill (guitar, keyboards), along with drummer Mel Gaynor, are the core of the band. It also currently features Andy Gillespie on keyboards and Ged Grimes on bass guitar. Formed in late 1977 from the ashes of punk rock group Johnny & the Self Abusers (which had only created one single), Simple Minds initially signed to Arista, who recorded and released their first three albums. As the the Self-Abusers, they had had a very raw and unpolished sound, playing their first gig in a Glasgow bar on Easter Monday in 1977. “When we were onstage it was mayhem,” Kerr later said. “No one could play a note. It was just white noise... took us about six months to become serious about it.”

The musical changes Simple Minds went through in these first three albums shows how diverse their song range is. Tracks to compare would be ""Chelsea Girl"", their first single with hints of Johnny and the Self Abusers that was inspired by Andy Warhol's pop art, and ""I Travel"", an almost disco sounding track, with ""Someone"", a loose yet energetic rock track that could have fit alongside the power pop bands at the Top of the Pops. The group grew major influence from the glam rock and post-punk ethos around them, particularly from the band's hero David Bowie.

Virgin Records saw the potential in the band and in 1981 signed them up. The first Virgin Records release, Sons And Fascination/Sister Feelings Call, was a double album. Yet it was later released as two single albums: Sons and Fascination and Sister Feelings Call. Their fan-base in the U.K. grew, but they couldn't quite break into the mainstream yet. In September 1981, founding drummer Brian McGee left the band, to be replaced by Gaynor.

They first found notable success with New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84), which is still regarded as their best album by some fans. Moving into a more melodic rock sound, Billboard magazine later called the release ""a creative peak"", and the 1982 album gave Simple Minds a top three U.K. chart slot. Irish rock group U2 took major influence from the band, particularly the aforementioned album, and they became often compared as friendly rivals from about this point on.

Soon afterwards, the band garnered great commercial success in Europe and their native U.K. since then (in the 80s and early 90s they sold 30 million albums worldwide). In the United States, however, they had a hard time reaching the popular pop audience. They finally smashed into the States with ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"", a new wave gem that was used in the soundtrack to the John Hughes coming-of-age film The Breakfast Club and went to number one. Ironically it is one of few songs recorded by the band that they didn't write themselves. Producer and composer Keith Forsey was such a devoted fan of the band and so fixated on the notion of them recording his tune that he flew to London to persuade them to do so, with them acceding mostly based on their budding personal friendship with Foresey.

In 1985, the arena rock fueled album Once Upon a Time yielded a string of worldwide hit singles such as ""Alive and Kicking"", ""Sanctify Yourself"", and ""Ghostdancing"" All this ead to playing bigger arenas and supporting Amnesty International with donations from record sales. ""Alive and Kicking"" in particular became something of a signature song of the band, it reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and garnered airplay all over Europe

Still, the pressures of touring and recording took their toll. Frontman Kerr later remarked, ""Looking back now, at the end of the '80s, one of the things we didn’t have was endless energy. That was 13 years of nonstop recording, writing, rehearsing, touring. The wheels were staring to come off"". Though the popularity of the band waned, with personnel changes leading to fan division, they kept on with their arena-ready sound and managed sporadic chart success. Critical reviews also favored the band.

Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill remain the core of the band to this day, with Andy Gillespie (keyboards), Mel Gaynor (drums) and Eddie Duffy (bass) supporting. Other members of the band are Michael MacNeil (keyboards), Derek Forbes (Bass), and John Giblin (Bass). They have maintained a strong fan-base world-wide, and their somewhat more recent album Black and White 050505 received critical acclaim on its release in September 2005, although it did not secure a release in the U.S.

The band embarked on a U.K.-wide arena tour towards the end of 2008 to celebrate 30 years as a band. This was considered a great success. Their latest studio album, Graffiti Soul,  was released on 25 May 2009. With praise appearing in publications such as Mojo magazine and the All Music Guide, the release became something of a comeback album, with it reaching the top 40 album charts in several nations. Fans also acclaimed the work.

The Cardigans,"The Cardigans are a Swedish band that formed in Jönköping, Småland, Sweden in 1992. The band's musical style has varied greatly from album to album; encompassing their early indie-leanings passing through '60s-inspired pop and more band-based rock. Their current lineup is Nina Persson on vocals, Peter Svensson on lead guitar, Magnus Sveningsson on bass guitar,  Bengt Lagerberg on drums and Lars-Olof Johansson on keyboards and guitar. 

The five-piece met as teenagers in Jönköping, Sweden, a town whose only distinguishing feature is its 52 churches. In October 1992, bonded by their mutual love of hard rock and folk music (they listed Nick Drake and Iron Maiden as their two biggest influences by 1994), guitarist Peter Svensson and bassist Magnus Sveningsson conceived The Cardigans. As their hometown was hardly a Mecca of musical enterprise, the group packed up and moved to the somewhat more central fishing port of Malmö, Sweden's third largest city, to seek their fortune. With Peter writing most of the music and the band as a whole composing the lyrics, the quintet set out to find a deal.

After an early recording of ""Rise & Shine"" appeared on a local independent label in 1994, The Cardigans were swiftly signed to Stockholm Records. The same year the band made their debut for the label with Emmerdale and later won the accolade of ""Best Album of 1994"" from Slitz, at the time Sweden's leading music magazine. The rise of The Cardigans has since been gradual, allowing them the time to develop naturally as their sales and positive exposure grew with each release. Their second long-player, Life, which followed in 1995, featured the hit singles ""Carnival"" and the re-recorded ""Rise & Shine"", and witnessed the band's first international chart success. Prior to the First Band on the Moon album in September 1996, The Cardigans released ""Lovefool"". Although the first response to the single was very positive and landed them in the Top 40, it achieved nowhere near the impact that awaited it the following Spring.

It was in 1997 that The Cardigans were first catapulted towards international superstardom. ""Lovefool""'s inclusion on the blockbuster Romeo and Juliet film soundtrack that Spring pushed them past the boiling point. The single not only reached No. 1 on both the United Kingdom and United States airplay charts but also debuted at No. 2 on the United Kingdom national chart, where it remained top five for five weeks. All in all, the album reached more than 2.5 million sales worldwide, achieving Platinum status in the United States and Japan, but only achieving Gold in the United Kingdom. The promotional activities supporting the worldwide success of ""Lovefool"" and First Band On The Moon were never ending. The band not only performed a year long world tour complete with endless radio sessions and press and television interviews, but even ended up making guest appearances on Beverly Hills 90210 and the David Letterman Show.

It was because of the sheer exhaustion resulting from such a schedule, that The Cardigans since took some well deserved time off at home in Malmö to recuperate their artistic juices and write new material. During their time off, however, the band was by no means dormant. In the beginning of 1999 they contributed a new track, ""War"", to the A Life Less Ordinary soundtrack, a live recording of ""Been It"" to the Lilith Fair compilation and ""Deuce"", featured on The X-Files: The Album, an X-Files soundtrack album. Their break also included experimentation with various solo projects.

In June 1998, the group, who are very loyal to their roots, once again joined long-time producer Tore Johansson at his studio, Country Hell, located beside the picturesque Svaneholm Castle in Malmö and recorded the album, Gran Turismo.

The first single ""My Favourite Game"", was a major hit in many territories. The video for ""My Favourite Game"" was directed by Jonas Åkerlund. The song was also included in the soundtrack of the hit Playstation racing game, Gran Turismo 2, were it was the intro theme. The second single ""Erase/Rewind"" was released in January 1999, and this single also turned out to be a major hit around the world. 

Gran Turismo reached more than 2.5 million sales worldwide.

The album Long Gone Before Daylight was released in February 2003 and from the album the singles ""For What It's Worth"" and ""You're The Storm"" were taken. The album received great reviews and the band spent most of 2003 touring Europe and North America.

In Fall 2005, the band released, Super Extra Gravity.

Gotye,"Wouter ""Wally"" De Backer (born 21 May 1980 in Bruges, Belgium), better known by the stage name Gotye, is an indie pop singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist based in Victoria, Australia.

Backer was born in Belgium, but moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia when he was two. Originally a member of the indie band Downstares, Backer began performing under the name Gotye in 2001 when the band disbanded. Aside from his solo work, De Backer has been a member of the indie band The Basics since its formation in 2002.

Gotye's second album Like Drawing Blood was featured by Triple J in May 2006 and was voted Number 1 in the listeners poll of the Best Album of 2006 . The album was also nominated for a J Award that year. Two tracks from that album, Learnalilgivinanlovin and Heart's A Mess, were ranked 94 and 8 respectively in Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2006. Like Drawing Blood has been certified Platinum. 

In September 2006, Gotye was nominated for an Australian Recording Industry Music Award (ARIA award) for best independent release for his album Like Drawing Blood, and won 'Most Outstanding New Independent Artist' at the inaugural Australian Independent Record (AIR) Chart Awards.

In 2007, Gotye won the ARIA for best male artist. As a result of the publicity of the nomination, Like Drawing Blood re-entered the ARIA album chart and was named iTunes UK Album of the Year in 2008.

In 2009, Heart's A Mess came in at #77 in Triple J Hottest 100 of all time, voted by the Australian public.

Amidst the lead-up to Gotye's third album, Like Drawing Blood re-entered the ARIA charts in mid 2011, peaking at its highest ever position of 13.

After the success of Like Drawing Blood, De Backer was able to establish a permanent home, still in Melbourne's South East. In 2010, De Backer set up a recording studio in a barn at his parents' farm and set about recording tracks for his third album. He released a new single, Eyes Wide Open, in mid-October 2010, online and on 10"" vinyl. The single received generally positive reviews and reached number 25 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2010. It was also shortlisted for the 2011 APRA Music Awards in the Song of the Year category.

In late March 2011, De Backer revealed the album's title to be Making Mirrors. This title was inspired by an artwork, painted by De Backer's father in the 1980s, discovered by De Backer amongst old bills and newspapers in his parents' barn, which was later edited in Photoshop to become the album artwork. ""The mirror reflects on artwork and it is all very related to self-reflection and introspection on the album."" 

On 19 May, it was announced that the album would be released on 19 August 2011, with the album launch the following day at the Sydney Opera House as part of the Graphic Festival which will feature animators and a 10-piece orchestra as part of Gotye's performance. De Backer also released a follow-up single to Eyes Wide Open titled Somebody That I Used to Know, which was released 6 July 2011, and debuted at #27 on the ARIA Top 50 Singles Chart. The single became something of a sensation, quickly moving up the ARIA singles chart despite comparatively low airplay to many other charting singles at the time. The track was further boosted by endorsements from well-known celebrities Ashton Kutcher and Lily Allen via Twitter, exposing Gotye's music to their millions of followers. The single has gone on to reach 6× Platinum (420,000 units sold) status.

On 15 July 2011, it was announced that Gotye's single Somebody That I Used to Know had come third in the 2011 Vanda & Young Songwriting Competition. As part of the prize, Gotye won a spot to perform at Song Summit 2012 at Darling Harbour, 26–28 May 2012.

On its first week of release, Making Mirrors came in at number one on the ARIA Australian album chart, making Gotye the first Australian act to simultaneously hold both the number one single and album since Silverchair, who achieved the same feat in 2007.

On 11 October 2011, it was announced that Gotye had been nominated for seven ARIA Awards. Due to the release date restrictions of the eligibility period, Making Mirrors could not be nominated, and the seven nominations all related to the single Somebody That I Used to Know. Gotye was nominated for Highest Selling Single, Single of the Year, Best Pop Release, Best Male Artist and three awards in the ARIA Artisan category: Best Video (Natasha Pincus), Engineer of the Year (Francois Tetaz) and Producer of the Year (Wally De Backer). On the same day the nominations were revealed, the winners of the Artisan categories were announced, with Gotye and the album personnel winning all three. On 27 November 2011, Gotye took out three of the four remaining ARIA Award nominations. Single of the Year, Best Male Artist and Best Pop Release. 

""Somebody That I Used To Know"" has become an international hit, reaching #1 in Australia, Belgium, United Kingdom, Poland, Austria, Ireland, Norway, The Netherlands, New Zealand and Germany, and also reached #1 on the alternative radio airplay charts in The United States and Canada (on the pop charts in those countries, the song has reached #5 and #11, respectively). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Gotye"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
