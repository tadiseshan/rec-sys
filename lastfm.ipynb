    "# Text Analysis: tf-idf and cosine similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been trying to learn more about tf-idf and cosine similarity, so I thought working with music-related data could be a fun way to do that. Using the LastFM api, I put together a csv file of 500 of their top artists and the lengthy version of their bios. The goal of this experiment was to see if I could find similar artists based on the words in artist biographies. "
