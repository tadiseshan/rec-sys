Coldplay,"Coldplay is a British alternative rock band, formed in London, United Kingdom in 1997. The band comprises vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland – who met each other in September 1996 at Ramsay Hall (halls of residence) at University College London - bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion.

Not only have Coldplay had 7 highly successful studio album releases (all of which debuted at #1 on the UK album chart) - with their latest 7th studio album released on December 4, 2015 (A Head Full of Dreams) - Coldplay have also achieved great success with their singles, such as Yellow, Speed of Sound, the Grammy-winning Clocks and the US and UK #1 single Viva La Vida.


Influences
Coldplay's early material was often compared to that of Jeff Buckley and Radiohead, while also drawing comparisons to U2 and Travis. Since the release of the band's debut album, Parachutes (2000), Coldplay has also drawn influence from other sources, including Echo and the Bunnymen and George Harrison on A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) and Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk for X&Y (2005).

Frontman Chris Martin credits 1980s Norwegian pop band a-ha for inspiring him to form his own band.

Coldplay never intended to become England's favorite rock & roll sons when their signature rock melodies ruled the charts throughout 2000. The quartet yearned to mess around a bit, plucking their own acoustics for fun while attending the University College of London. All had been playing instruments since their early teens and had been influenced by the likes of Bob Dylan, the Stone Roses, Neil Young, and My Bloody Valentine.

They never imagined taking reign of the UK's ever-changing rock scene. Each member had come from a solid household of middle-class parents who encouraged music. Chris Martin, the eldest of five siblings, began playing the piano as a young child. He started playing in bands around age 15 and sought solace in the words of Tom Waits. Jonny Buckland, on the other hand, was into the heavy guitar work of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix and was playing guitar by age 11. Scotland native Guy Berryman was into funk instead of indie rock, therefore leaving him to play bass. The multi-instrumentalist Champion had not planned to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay. He favored playing guitar, bass, and the tin whistle, but caught on to playing percussion when the band became official.

When they burst onto the scene, Coldplay were heart-wrenching like Travis, passionate like Jeff Buckley, and as fresh as Oasis. They played their first gig at a festival for unsigned bands in Manchester, and the Safety EP was issued shortly thereafter. The Brothers & Sisters EP was issued by Fierce Panda and released a year later. (Both releases saw only 500 pressings.) Their sweet melodies and swooning lyrics landed Coldplay a UK deal with Parlophone in April 1999, and the five-track limited edition Blue Room EP followed that autumn. With nods from the media, the dream pop foursome was hailed as the next Travis, thanks to their simplistic acoustics and charming personas. Two more EPs, Shiver and Yellow, arrived in Spring 2000.

Albums
The band has released 5 albums with the latest sixth album scheduled for release in May 2014: Parachutes (2000), A Rush Of Blood To The Head (2002), X&Y (2005), Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), Mylo Xyoto (2011) and in May 2014, Ghost Stories (2014).

Parachutes (2000)
Their full-length debut album, Parachutes, earned the band a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the UK. It saw a US release in November 2000, and a month later Yellow,  was chosen as the theme song for all promo spots for the American TV network ABC. The well-received hype surrounding Coldplay continued throughout 2001 as well; they were nominated for three Brit Awards and embarked on a sold-out ten-date tour of the US. Rumors of a split consumed most of the US tour. Martin frequently battled nasty colds and voice exhaustion, which led Coldplay to cancel a series of American dates and scrap a European tour. With all gossip aside, Coldplay resumed playing in Summer 2001 and earned additional success with second single Trouble.

A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002)
By the autumn, they had headed into the studio for a second album. Rumour had it that it might be Coldplay's last album, since the band members felt they might not capture such brilliance again. A Rush Of Blood To The Head was released in August 2002. The CD/DVD package Live 2003 was issued a year later. Capturing the band's show at the Horden Pavilion in Sydney, Australia, it highlighted Coldplay's monumental success worldwide with A Rush Of Blood To The Head. Martin specifically earned a higher notch on the celebrity scale by marrying actress Gwyneth Paltrow in December 2003. Paltrow gave birth to the couple's first daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin, the following April.

X&Y (2005)
Fatherhood did not stop Martin from working, as Coldplay began recording material for a third album within weeks. Previously recorded material with long-time producer Ken Nelson was scrapped early on, while producer Danton Supple (Morrissey, The Cure) joined Coldplay to complete the recording of X&Y. Speed Of Sound marked Coldplay's first single from their long-awaited third effort in Spring 2005; the album followed in June, topping the charts around the world, including America and Britain.

Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008)
Coldplay's fourth album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was released on June 12, 2008 in the United Kingdom, with the first single Violet Hill having been previously released as a free download through their official website for a week from April 29, 2008. Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was produced by Brian Eno, mixed by Markus Dravs, and drew influence from the time the group spent in South America. 
The album received lots of positive feedback for its originality in melodic acoustics and slightly less 'synth-dependent' riffs. It offered a great insight into how significantly the band's music had adapted and developed to themselves and the public.

Charity duet (single) for World AIDS Day (2008)
Barely a week before the album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was released, a duet with Kylie Minogue, which was intended to be used on the album, was scrapped with the comment that 'it’s just too sexy […] also we haven’t quite finished it'. The track, Lhuna was subsequently released as a charity single to promote World AIDS Day 2008 on December 1, 2008.

Mylo Xyloto (2011)
Coldplay's fifth album, Mylo Xyloto, was released on October 24, 2011, with the first two tracks from the album - Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall and Paradise - were released on June 3, 2011 and September 12, 2012 respectively. The album was no.1 in over 34 countries, and has sold over 8m copies worldwide.

Ghost Stories (2014)
The band's sixth album, Ghost Stories, was officially released on May 19, 2014. Prior to the release, Coldplay made the full album available to stream via iTunes, with an animation of the album artwork designed by Mila Fürstová, one week ahead of the official release date. The first track from the album, Midnight was released on February 25, 2014. The album was recorded at The Bakery and The Beehive studios in London, England. Ghost Stories entered the Billboard 200 as Number 1 and marked Coldplay's fourth straight number 1 studio album, selling 383,000 copies in the US in the week ending May 25, 2014 - of which 64% came from digital downloads according to Billboard.

A Head Full of Dreams (2015)
The band's 7th studio album, A Head Full of Dreams, was released December 4, 2015 on the Parlophone label. The 11-track album (with an additional hidden track called “X Marks The Spot”) was recorded in LA and London, and was produced by Stargate and Rik Simpson. A world tour is promised to accompany the album in 2016.

Super Bowl - February 2016
Coldplay headlined at the much coverted Super Bowl 50 half-time show on February 7, 2016. The band performed a remixed version of their hit single ""Yellow"", before playing ""Vida La Vida"", ""Paradise"" and their 2015 single ""Adventure Of A Lifetime"". Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson then took to the stage to perform their hit ""Uptown Funk"", before Beyoncé emerged on stage with her latest single ""Formation"".

2016 - First US tour since 2012
Coldplay announced its Head Full of Dreams tour on January 28, 2016 - the first in the USA since 2012. The first concert will be held at MetLife Stadium (New York) on July 16, 2016.

Commercial endorsements
Coldplay are one of very few current British music acts to achieve major success in North America. Despite their large worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, refusing its use for product endorsements. In the past, Coldplay had turned down multi-million dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who wanted to use the songs Yellow, Trouble, and Don't Panic respectively. According to Martin, ""We wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs' meanings like that.""  On the other hand, Yellow has been used to back TV trailers for ""The Simpsons"" and Viva La Vida featured on an iTunes TV advert.

Political and social activism
Since 2002, Coldplay have been active supporters of various social and political causes. They have been visible advocates of Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. The group has also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, and the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Radiohead,"Radiohead are an English alternative rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK which formed in 1985. The band is composed of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, beats), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboard, other instruments), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Greenwood (bass guitar) and Phil Selway (drums, percussion).

The early years (1992 – 1995)
Radiohead released their first single, ""Creep"" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993).  Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). The band's textured guitar parts and Yorke's falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans. 

International success (1996 - 2000)
Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s.

A change in style and leaving EMI (2000 – 2003)
Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a change in the band's musical style. Radiohead incorporated experimental electronic music, Krautrock, post-punk and jazz influences into their songs, dividing fans and critics, but they remained popular. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of guitar-driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by headlines, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. 

Independent releases and touring (2005 - 2013)
In 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows, originally as a digital download for which each customer could set their own price, later in stores, to critical and chart success.

In 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs - again independently - which was described as an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures.

In February 2012, Radiohead began The King of Limbs world tour - with concerts in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In early 2013, following the tour, Thom Yorke released a studio album entitled Amok with his band Atoms for Peace.

Ninth Studio Album - ""A Moon Shaped Pool""  (2016)
After much speculation, on May 8, 2016, Radiohead released their long awaited ninth album,""A Moon Shaped Pool"" on various streaming services. The band announced the release of their latest 11-track album on Twitter. The first track from the album was ""Burn the Witch"".

Glastonbury 2017
On October 20, 2016, Radiohead was announced as the headline act for the opening night at Glastonbury Music Festival in June 2017. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Sia,"Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (born 18 December 1975) or simply Sia, is an Australian pop, downtempo, and jazz singer and songwriter. In 2000, her single, ""Taken for Granted"" was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. Her 2008 album, Some People Have Real Problems peaked in the top 30 on the Billboard 200. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2009, she won the award for 'Best Music DVD' and received six nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 and won 'Best Independent Release' and 'Best Pop Release' for We Are Born and 'Best Video' for the song ""Clap Your Hands"".  

In 2000, the Adelaide born singer scored a bolt from the blue Top 10 hit with her debut single, Taken For Granted. Pairing her unique Australian drawl with the strident strings from Sergei Prokofiev's 'Romeo & Juliet', the track was championed by Trevor Nelson and had Sia performing live on Jo Whiley's Radio 1 show. Her debut album, Healing Is Difficult, arrived to similar cries of ´the next big R&B thing'. Then, to cap it all, she added her jazzy slurs to two tracks on Zero 7's Simple Things album and became the unmistakable voice of the year's coolest down-tempo soundtrack. All the pieces for a phenomenal career seemed to be in place.

And then nothing. 

""I went a bit mental after that,"" she explains, before letting out a laugh that would stop traffic. ""No seriously, I needed therapy and everything."" She recovers her composure only long enough to explain that going from hero to zero left her confused and frustrated and that it was a really enjoyable time, those moments of feeling like a 'Coolio'! But sadly they've passed now.

Brandishing both wicked humour and brutal honesty, it's sometimes hard to know exactly when Sia's joking. What is certain is that, with fragile beauty, a collaboration with Beck, and swathes of sensual soul-searching, 'Healing Is Difficult's long overdue follow-up, ‘Colour The Small One, rekindles thoughts of an all conquering phenomenon and will surely make her a 'coolio' once again.

From the lilting pianos and claustrophobic beats of Breathe Me, to Sunday's enchanting harmonium and breathless chant, it's a mesmerising album, undercut by the hope and despair of a little girl lost. Guilt, and how to deal with it, is the recurring theme with Sia's vulnerable voice as a beacon guiding through the pain and fear. ""I call it easy Listening,"" snorts Sia trying to keep a straight face. ""That's what I've been telling everyone."" A mix of horror and hilarity dawns on her face. ""Do you think it's depressing? It's not too depressing is it? It's meant to be nice, easy, music. Songy and lush."" 

Whatever it is, it certainly isn't the album anyone was expecting. The muffled rhythm track and sensual cinematic strings of Don't Bring Me Down are a stratosphere away from Taken For Granted's dogmatic march. Colour The Small One would never be mistaken for R&B. ""I hated that,"" she cringes at the thought of the jazzy beats and soulful grooves of her first album being tagged 'urban'. But that's not why this album's different. ""I just wanted to make an album that was more song driven, and I've changed as a person. After the first album I lost it, and this album reflects how I was feeling. The vocals are small and needy, because that's how I felt."" She looks momentarily troubled before adding, ""Plus, I'd tried to have a pop career and it didn't work, so I thought I'd try something else."" More strangulated giggling. ""If this doesn't work I'll fuck off back to Australia.""

Sia's vocal talents extend all the way back to her earliest memory. But unlike most singers, she isn't exactly the product of her childhood influences. Born in Adelaide, she was raised on the hippiest street in Australia. ""Everyone was a musician or worked for Circus Oz."" Her parents played in a rockabilly band called The Soda Jerks, and her dad, ""a real nut nut"", briefly played guitar in uncle Colin's band Men At Work- yes, they of 'I Come From A Land Down Under' fame- but ""they kicked him out for being too in yer face."" Early appearances singing Shangri-Las songs aside, Sia's musical leanings didn't get serious until she joined jazz-funk bar band  Crisp  at 17. ""We thought we were really cutting edge,"" she sniggers with a roll of her eyes, ""but we were trying way too hard."" 

In fact, Sia credits the biggest influence on both her and Colour The Small One as touring with Zero 7. ""That's when I actually started listening to music,"" she says with a grimace of embarrassment. ""All the other music I'd listened to in my life had been incidental; in clubs, cars, lifts. I only owned 2 CDs: The Jackson 5 anthology and Jeff Buckley's Grace. While we were on tour, the Zero 7 guys were always talking about artists I'd never heard of, so I bought a Discman and started listening to their James Taylor, Nick Drake, Harry Neilson, Randy Newman and Django Bates CDs. And it all just really blew me away.""

Colour The Small One's lyrical roots, however, run much deeper. After three years fronting Crisp, Sia packed her bags and headed off with an open ended ticket on a round the World trip. After enjoying colourful times in some unusual places, she agreed to meet up in London with the man she describes as her 'first true love'. A week before she arrived, he was run down and killed by a black cab on Kensington High Street.

""Nearly everything on the first album was about that,"" she says, her chirpy facade slipping. ""I was pretty fucked up after Dan died. I couldn't really feel anything. I could intellectualise a lot of stuff; that I had a purpose, that I was loved, but I couldn't actually feel anything. The last album was very deflective. This one's very exposing. I think that's the difference between the two albums, the first was intellectualising, this one is feeling."" Catching herself being uncharacteristically serious, she quickly deflects with a half chuckle of, ""and I'd quit drinking. That was probably what it was.""

Bully, the track she wrote with Beck has similarly serious roots. ""There was this kid at school who I used to be really cruel to, and I've felt bad about it ever since. It got to the point where I was having nightmares about it. So I wanted to write a sorry song."" Thankfully, the collaboration itself had happier origins. ""The last date of the Zero 7 tour was a festival at the Universal Amphitheatre in LA and Beck was on the same bill. Next thing he's ringing Zero 7's management asking if I'd like to duet with him."" Understandably she said yes, and found herself on stage singing 'You're The One That I Want' from Grease. ""I suggested it as a joke; but we changed the major to a minor, made it really slow and turned it into a bit of a country stalker anthem."" 

The Beck and Zero 7 connections- Sia's already recorded two more tracks to their next album - give the biggest clues to ‘Untitled’ and the giggling Australian's current intentions. ""I don't want to be a superstar, doing all that wibbly-wobbly stuff. It's too emotionally stressful; photo shoots always make me want to have plastic surgery. I just wanted to write an album that was me: a small, weird, needy freak. It's a slow burner, but it's honest.""

Colour The Small One was released in the UK on 12th January 2004. 

And then, she came back with her new album Some People Have Real Problems, released on 8 January 2008. A little bit different from her previous albums, the new album received good reviews, although some critics and fans didn't really like the new  ""a little bit more pop"" direction. 

The first single  Day Too Soon  was released on 12 November 2007 in the UK and was followed by The Girl You Lost to Cocaine  on the 21st April 2008 and later followed by Soon We'll Be Found which was released on 13 October 2008. Soon We'll Be Found got the best reviews because of its music video. In the music video, Sia sings while signing the lyrics in American Sign Language.

Sia worked with  Christina Aguilera  on her new album Bionic and the new collaboration has produced four tracks including the soulful ballad ""You Lost Me"". The album was released June 8, 2010. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sia"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Weeknd,"The Weeknd, the stage name for Abel Tesfaye, is a Canadian singer-songwriter and producer.
The Scarborough, Toronto-born singer, songwriter, and producer doesn't say much outside of his lyrics or personal messages through his social networking sites. Ever since appearing on the scene in late 2010, he's been shrouded in mystery, cultivating a mystique that baffles our gossip-obsessed pop culture. With that said, the 25-year-old alternative R&B phenomenon is an enigma in more ways than one.

For him, it's not about becoming famous. It's not about becoming rich. It's not about pleasing anyone. It's about being honest, staying true to his art, and diving headfirst into the deep end. History's most impactful artists from Van Gogh and Charles Bukowski to Miles Davis and John Lennon faced both the abyss and the heavens. They knew about sex, drugs, pain, joy, and love, and they weren't afraid to talk about them openly.

On his three-disc debut for XO/Republic Records, Trilogy, The Weeknd is an open book, revealing
everything and nothing at the same time. There are moments of ecstatic electronic bliss like the irresistible ""High for This"", and then there's the propulsive poetic paranoia of ""House of Balloons"", which twists a sample Siouxsie and the Banshees' Happy House into a frenetic danceable coup. With an inimitable and divine voice, he sings of hazy nights that turned into hazier mornings and tumultuous trysts that spiraled into eternal longing. However, you can take whatever you want from it. After all, it is art.

His trip officially began with the release of the nine-song free album House of Balloons in March 2011. It was the first in a series of three-including Thursday and Echoes of Silence-and it immediately set the blog-o-sphere ablaze. Soon after the initial instalment impacted the net, Drake quoted lyrics from the effort on Twitter and linked to the music, becoming the first of many A-list artists to champion it. The two quickly forged a tight friendship and fertile artistic partnership that extended to Drake's team.

As they grew closer, the superstar MC even enlisted his talents for several tracks on the chart-topping, platinum-selling and Grammy Award winning album Take Care. Most notably, The Weeknd co-wrote, co-produced, and performed on ""Crew Love"", a bona fide hit single from the record. Further collaborating, Drake dropped a transfixing verse on ""The Zone"" from Thursday.

The artist hit the road for his first sold out headline tour that summer, and the world began to embrace him with open arms from underground bloggers to taste-making music supervisors. ""High for This"" even served as the soundtrack to the trailer for the final season of HBO's long-running series, Entourage, a symbol of his infiltration into the zeitgeist.

Meanwhile, critics and gatekeepers also fell under his spell. Complex dubbed House of Balloons the ""best album of 2011"", and Pitchfork honored it as ""Best New Music"". It conquered year-end lists, including Stereogum, The A.V. Club, The Guardian (UK), and Spin. MTV, BET, Rolling Stone, XXL, and others exalted it with equally high praise, while The Source called him the ""Songbird of his generation"".

In the midst of everything, other marquee artists began to personally seek out his unique talent, and that was the highest compliment. He created the first formal remix for FLORENCE + THE MACHINE's ""Shake It Out"", and he put his stamp on LADY GAGA's ""Marry the Night"", yielding a seductive and sensual take on the single for Born This Way: The Remixes. The Weeknd also personally cooked up ""Remember You"" the second single for WIZ KHALIFA's anxiously awaited sophomore effort, O.N.I.F.C.

In the summer of 2012, a groundbreaking strategic alliance between XO, creative collective visionary behind The Weeknd and Republic Records was established. Under this banner, Trilogy compiled House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence in one expansive collection, properly mixed, mastered, and
finished for the very first time. The 27 original tracks remain, but there's also a myriad of new material as well to please both the initiated and uninitiated alike. The doorway officially opens into his world with this effort.

The first single ""Wicked Games"" bleeds brilliantly with a stark and vivid admission that's utterly enthralling. Keyboards resound through airy production as the vocals exude a dark sensuality. The singer admits, ""I love to watch you dance, take you down another level and get you dancing with the devil"", before the unforgettable, unbridled hook, ""Let me motherfucking love you"".

You're going to motherfucking love him. Live audiences continue to as well. In addition to surprise appearances on DRAKE's Club Paradise tour and a stint supporting FLORENCE + THE MACHINE, he dazzled crowds at the biggest festivals in the world including Coachella, Primavera Sound Festival, and the Wireless Festival in London and on a seemingly endless run of sold out headline gigs. The next chapter has begun though.

Coming together, Republic Records and the Canadian XO are paving the way for a revolution. Already, XO has progressed from an intimate Toronto operation into an international player. Everything stems from the music though, and it always will. THE WEEKND addressed fans in an open letter online, ""You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you."" He released his second album, ""Kiss Land"", on September 10, 2013.

(2) Allegedly ""shrouded in mystery"" despite a social media presence (with accompanying photos) on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Soundcloud, and YouTube, as well as major support from fellow Torontonian Drake, alternative R&B act the Weeknd -- a solo outlet for vocalist Abel Tesfaye -- surfaced in March 2011 with House of Balloons. A nine-track, 50-minute mixtape made available for free download on the Weeknd website, House of Balloons was based in morose ballads filled with drug references and sexual longing. Sonically, there were clear traces of radio-friendly contemporary R&B à la Trey Songz, Jeremih, the-Dream, and Drake, while also appealing to listeners who favored left-of-center, production-over-songcraft exponents like Spacek and Sa-Ra. The mixtape, made by Tesfaye in collaboration with producers Doc McKinney and Illangelo, among others, garnered widespread coverage -- most of which was gushingly positive -- within days of its March 21 release. A second mixtape, Thursday (August 19), preceded several appearances on Drake's album Take Care. Echoes of Silence (December 21), the third Weeknd mixtape, followed just before the end of the year. The following June, ""Crew Love,"" off Take Care, reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. A few months later, he was featured on another charting single, Wiz Khalifa's ""Remember You."" 

 After Tesfaye signed with Universal Republic, the three Weeknd mixtapes were remastered and bundled with three new songs for Trilogy, issued in November 2012. The set debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. The following April, Tesfaye won Juno Awards in the categories of Breakthrough Artist of the Year and R&B/Soul Recording of the Year. Trilogy was certified platinum by the RIAA the next month. Kiss Land, much darker in tone than its title implied, followed in September 2013 and debuted at number two. Out of its several singles, only ""Live For,"" featuring Drake, touched the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. Tesfaye had much more success with a series of non-album singles that followed. ""Often,"" released in 2014, was a Top Ten R&B/Hip-Hop hit. He was featured on Ariana Grande's ""Love Me Harder,"" which reached the Top Ten of the Hot 100 and went platinum in the U.S. ""Earned It,"" featured in Fifty Shades of Grey, repeated the same feats. In 2015, Tesfaye issued ""The Hills,"" a booming ballad, and ""Can't Feel My Face,"" a disco-funk throwback, as the first two singles from Chapter III. The former cracked the Hot 100 Top 20, while the latter reached the chart's Top 10. ~ Andy Kellman <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Drake,"Aubrey “Drake” Graham (born October 24, 1986 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Grammy award nominated Canadian actor, rapper and singer signed to Young Money/Universal Motown. Drake shot to global fame upon the release of his critically acclaimed 2009 mixtape So Far Gone and Best I Ever Had, a single from the mixtape which peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Drake's music career began in 2006 with the release of his debut mixtape room for improvement. The tape featured collaborations with Trey Songz, Lupe Fiasco and Nikelus F and marked the beginning of a long-time partnership with Canadian producer boi-1da. The mixtape sold 6,000 physical copies in the year of its release.

comeback season, Drake's second official mixtape, was released in 2007 and featured the single replacement girl. The track featured vocals from Trey Songz and received heavy rotation on MTV and BET television networks. robin thicke, clipse and rich boy featured on the mixtape, however it was Man of the Year - a track recorded with future mentor lil wayne - which signified the start of a close affiliation between Drake and Lil' Wayne's recording label Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his highly anticipated third mixtape so far gone to critical acclaim and commercial success. Its lead single, Best I Ever Had, peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA. The success of the track lead to a highly publicised bidding war between several record labels to sign Drake. The rapper eventually signed a deal with Young Money Entertainment in the summer of 2009 and released an official EP version of the mixtape soon after; eventually receiving Gold status for shipments of 500,000 units.

This astronomical rise to success continued into 2010 with the release of his major label debut album thank me later. After several setbacks from its original October 2009 release date, the album was released on June 15th 2010 preceded by lead single over, which peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at #1 on the Hot Rap Songs chart. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Album Chart and has since been certified Platinum by the RIAA for sales of approximately 1,100,000 copies in the US to date. It produced three further singles which attained chart success; Find Your Love, Miss Me (feat. Lil' Wayne) and fancy (feat. T.I. & Swizz Beatz).

Drake released his second album 'Take Care' in November 2011 and it critically and commercially was very successful.The album spawned eight singles including the immensely popular The Motto which introduced the term 'YOLO' to the mainstream. With features from Lil Wayne, Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj and more the album went 2x platinum in the United States and in Canada, but only managing gold in the United Kingdom.

In November 2013 Drake released the highly anticipated 'Nothing Was The Same'  which was also very critically and commercially succesful and has since spawned seven singles. Jay Z is the only other rapper to appear on the standard version of the album. Drake said about the album ""Take Care was about connecting with my city and connecting with my past and sort of still feeling guilty that I'm not in love with one of these girls that cared about me from back in the day. Now, I'm 26, I'm with my friends, I'm making jobs for people, I'm making memories for people that will last a lifetime. I don't need to be in love right now. I don't need these things that I maybe once thought that I needed to feel normal and feel righteous about myself. I think for the first time in an album I'm content—not satisfied—but proud of where I'm at as a person.""

Drake announced in July 2014 that his next album would be titled 'Views from the 6', though no release date has been given. However, in February 2015, with no prior announcement, Drake released 'If You're Reading This It's Too Late' on iTunes. This marked Drake's fourth retail release with his record label Cash Money Records. Despite stating the release as a mix-tape it was made available for purchase on iTunes. As of August 2015, 'If You're Reading This It's Too Late' has sold over 1 million copies. Drake is the first artist to pass the Platinum album status in 2015.

Drake released his fourth album, Views, in 2016, breaking numerous chart records in the process. Views sat atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a solo male to do so in over 10 years. It also saw Drake leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 simultaneously for eight weeks, breaking the previous record of seven held by both Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. It also achieved triple platinum status in the U.S., and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. One of the tracks,  One Dance, became Drake's first #1 single on the Hot 100, spending ten weeks on top of the chart. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Drake"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rihanna,"Robyn Rihanna Fenty (born February 20, 1988), known by her stage name, Rihanna, is a Bajan singer.  Her song Umbrella was one of the highest-selling songs of 2007 and her 3rd album Good Girl Gone Bad was critically acclaimed, helping propel her to superstar status. She has attained thirteen Billboard Hot 100 number ones thus far and is the second Bajan artist to win a Grammy Award. She is also a cultural ambassador for Barbados.

Rihanna was born in Saint Michael, Barbados to Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor, and Monica Fenty, an accountant.  Her mother, a native of Guyana, is Afro-Guyanese and her father is Bajan and Irish. She is the oldest of three siblings; two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty.  She began singing at around the age of seven.  Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's addiction to crack cocaine and parent's rocky marriage, which ended when she was fourteen years old.  Rihanna attended Charles F. Broome Memorial School, a primary school in Barbados, and then the Combermere School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates at the age of fifteen.  In 2004 she won the Miss Combermere Beauty Pageant.  She was an army cadet in a sub-military programme that trained with the military of Barbados and Shontelle was her drill sergeant.

At the age of 15, she formed a girl group with two of her classmates.  In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing in Barbados with his wife.  The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that ""the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.""   While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang Destiny's Child's cover of ""Emotion"".  Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with Rogers and his wife.  Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad ""The Last Time,"" a cover of Whitney Houston’s hit ""For the Love of You"" and what would become her first hit, ""Pon de Replay"" to send to various recording companies.  It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna's demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her to audition for the label's then-president, Jay-Z, who quickly signed her.

Rihanna broke into the recording industry in 2005 with the release of her debut album Music of the Sun, which features the number 2 hit single ""Pon de Replay"".  Less than a year later, Rihanna released A Girl Like Me and earned her first number-one single, ""SOS, which sampled the popular 80s track ""Tainted Love"".  ""Unfaithful"" was also released and was fairly successful.

Rihanna released her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, in June 2007. Prior to the release of the album, she spent the week of the Grammys writing songs for the album with Ne-Yo.  She adopted a more sexual image while recording the album, eventually dying her hair black and cutting it short. Rihanna worked with Timbaland and Christopher ""Tricky"" Stewart, as well as previous musical collaborators such as Stargate, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers to re-imagine her album compositions with uptempo dance tracks. Rihanna commented, ""I want to keep people dancing but still be soulful at the same time.  You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs].""

The album topped the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Russia and Ireland, and peaked at number two in the United States and Australia.  Unlike previous work, the album featured a more dance-pop sound instead of the dancehall, reggae and ballad styles. The album received positive reviews by critics, becoming her most critically acclaimed album at that time compared to her previous efforts.

It yielded eight hit singles - ""Umbrella""  ""Shut Up and Drive"", ""Don't Stop The Music"" ""Hate That I Love You"" ""Rehab"" ""Disturbia"" ""Take A Bow"" ""If I Never See Your Face Again"" - all singles reaching the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 — including the worldwide number-one hit ""Umbrella,"" featuring Jay-Z.  

In addition to reaching number one in various countries, ""Umbrella"" was the number one single in the United Kingdom for ten consecutive weeks, making it the longest-running number-one single since Wet Wet Wet's single ""Love Is All Around"" spent fifteen weeks at the top in 1994.  The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007 published by Rolling Stone magazine.  In 2008, ""Umbrella"" earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It managed to stay at number one in the United Kingdom for 10 weeks, the longest time spent by a female and in the 21st century, on this chart.

""Umbrella"" has also been recognised in various forms of accolades by the music press. The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007, published by the music magazine Rolling Stone. Time magazine also listed the song number three on their Top 10 Songs of 2007. The song is listed number one on Entertainment Weekly magazine's list of the 10 Best Singles of 2007, while topping the magazine's poll for the best single of 2007. Blender magazine awarded the song Song of the Year in their Readers' Poll 2007. The music press has considered ""Umbrella"" as 2007's Song of the Summer,  while The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh regarded it as ""arguably 2007's signature slow jam"".

In August 2009, Rihanna collaborated with Jay-Z and Kanye West on ""Run This Town."" The song peaked at number two on Billboard Hot 100 and also reached the top ten in five other countries. She appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia for the September 2009 Issue.  The shoot was influenced by Rihanna's hair, which she had cut for the shoot into a mohawk-like style. The style of the shoot was Extreme Couture and very dark, and in one shot she appeared semi-nude.  Rihanna performed ""Run This Town"" along with Jay-Z and West for the ""Answer the Call"" concert at Madison Square Garden in September 2009, making it her first musical performance since the altercation with Brown. The trio also performed ""Run This Town,"" on the premiere of The Jay Leno Show on September 14, 2009.

In November of 2009, ""Rated R"" was released in the wake of a physical altercation with romantic interest Chris Brown, who pled guilty to felony assault. The album's lead single, ""Russian Roulette"" -- written with Ne-Yo - was one of the year's most controversial singles. The album also includes collaborations with Tricky, The-Dream, Stargate, and SRP.

One year later, Rihanna released her fifth studio album called ""Loud'. It's lead single, ""Only Girl (In the World)"", reached number one in more than ten countries. The song also won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.

""Talk That Talk"" was released one year after ""Loud"". With the song ""We Found Love"", Rihanna became the fastest solo artist in the chart's history to achieve twenty Hot 100 top-ten singles, breaking the previous record set by Madonna. The song later became her eleventh number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. ""You Da One"" became the second single from the album but was not as successful as ""We Found Love"". The third single from the album, ""Talk That Talk"" featuring Jay-Z, was announced on Rihanna's Twitter. The fourth single, ""Where Have You Been"", peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.


On February 20, 2012, Rihanna and Chris Brown released 2 remixes, one featuring the ""Talk That Talk"" album track ""Birthday Cake"" and the other featuring Chris Brown's ""Turn Up The Music""

In April 2012, the singer appeared in the movie ""Battleship"", which is based on the game of the same name.

Rihanna's seventh album, Unapologetic was released on November 19, 2012; it was preceded by the lead single Diamonds, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the chart and tying her with Madonna and The Supremes for the fourth-most number ones in the chart's history.

Rihanna has been working on her, currently untitled, eighth studio album since 2014. The first single from her upcoming album FourFiveSeconds was released on January 24, 2015. The second single Bitch Better Have My Money debuted on Tidal on April 5, 2015.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers' original founder and guitarist, Slovak, was replaced in 1984 by Jack Sherman, while Slovak and Irons recorded music with their band at the time, ""What Is This?"" Upon Slovak's return, Sherman was fired from the band. 

Slovak did not actually appear on the self-titled debut album, despite performing and writing the content with the band prior to recording. He was replaced by Jack Sherman for the recording of the album, but returned to the band for second album, Freaky Styley. The third album, Uplift Mofo Party Plan, is in fact the only album to include all four founding members. After this, Slovak overdosed on heroin and was replaced on future albums (Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magik  - on which Frusciante provides guitars, One Hot Minute - Navarro,  Californication and By the Way - Frusciante) Frusciante is also on 2006's Stadium Arcadium.

Following Slovak's death of a heroin overdose, a young John Frusciante took over as guitarist in 1988. Frusciante, however, quit the band in 1992 due in part to his sadness at the band becoming so successful in such a short time; complex personal issues, involving an addiction to heroin, were also a factor. He was then replaced by Arik Marshall. Approximately a year later, Marshall left the band, to be replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.

After the release of 1995's One Hot Minute, Navarro's escalating drug habits became a subject of conflict. In 1998, Navarro was fired from the band, to be taken over by none other than former guitarist, Frusciante, who remained in the band until 2008, when he quietly took his leave on good terms with the other members.

Frusciante has also been making solo albums for a number of years. His new album with the band Ataxia came out May 2007, and is titled Automatic Writing II.

In 2003 Flea played bass on The Mars Volta's album Deloused In The Comatorium. Frusciante added guitar to tracks on Deloused and 2005's Frances The Mute. He also played rhythm guitar on The Mars Volta's Amputechture. Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez, guitarist for The Mars Volta, appeared on Stadium Arcadium, playing the solo on ""Especially In Michigan"".

In 2011, the band released  I'm With You, their tenth studio album, and their first with guitarist Josh Klinghoffer.

A new era in the band's history took place due Frusciante's departure in 2009. He was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who had already played shows as a second guitarist with the band during their 2007 tour dates. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Since signing to Fueled By Ramen in 2012, the duo have released their major label debut Vessel in January of 2013, and its explosively popular follow-up Blurryface in May of 2015. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Twenty+One+Pilots"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Major Lazer,"Years after the zombie apocalypse ravaged the galaxy, Major Lazer went into isolation after bringing peace and order to Earth. With the help of a mysterious shadow government called Cinco he was cryogenically frozen as a safeguard for the future’s wellbeing. Despite a great many years of pursuing peace on the planet, a new threat began to loom on the horizon and the commando was brought out of sleep by the Committee of Five. This intergalactic group faced an opponent that only Major Lazer could defend against: his former superior and commander General Rubbish. Rubbish had come out of deep space hiding with a new weapon...Terror Lazor and was set out to enslave and capture all of Earth's allies to seize inter-galactic planetary control and then destroy Earth. With dwindling resources to defend Earth and its allies, the Committee of Five brought Major Lazer out of cryogenic slumber. He was assigned a partner, the female assassin known only as Knife Fight. Together they set out to FREE THE UNIVERSE, beginning on the fortuitous date of April 15th, 2013.

Since 2011, the group consists of Diplo, Jillionaire and Walshy Fire

After releasing their landmark LP Guns Don't Kill People...Lazers Do in 2009, the heroic production duo of Diplo and Switch found themselves boldly marching forwards toward the end of the aughts, conquering major milestones. From 2009 to 2011, the twosome toured extensively across the United States and the world, selling out shows and performing at some of music’s major festivals, including Coachella, Pitchfork, Sasquatch, Outside Lands, and Falls Music & Arts Festival.

In 2010, Major Lazer released Lazerproof, a free download mixtape with pop sensation La Roux, and Lazers Never Die, an EP featuring two new tracks and three remixes, including one by Thom Yorke. One of the foremost breakthroughs for Major Lazer during this time was the production collaboration with Beyoncé on her single “Run the World (Girls)”, which sampled their track “Pon de Floor."" BeyoncÉ directly sought out Switch and Diplo, recognizing the fact that they were creating authentically innovative music and further cementing their status as a production team worthy of worldwide mainstream attention. As 2011 turned to 2012, Switch determined it best to pursue his own path, leaving Diplo in full control of Major Lazer.

As the sole executive producer of Major Lazer, Diplo continued to spearhead the current dancehall revival movement with the 2013 release Free The Universe. That album included collaborations with Bruno Mars, Tyga, Flux Pavilion, Wynter Gordon, Shaggy, Wyclef Jean, Ezra Koening from Vampire Weekend, Dev and more. Spin called the LP’s first single ""Get Free"" featuring Amber Coffman of Dirty Projectors, ""a meeting point between Jamaica, West Africa, and Brooklyn."" 

Diplo (AKA Wesley Pentz) has risen through the ranks and has asserted himself as one of the most pioneering producers of the time. Through unending curiosity and exploration of the vast multitudes of the world’s musical heritages, Diplo has managed to seamlessly connect the global underground to the audio mainstream. He is the Grammy-nominated founder, owner and head honcho of Mad Decent records, which has not only garnered widespread critical and audience accolades since its inception, but has also deservedly earned a hefty reputation as a vanguard of groundbreaking releases. As Major Lazer, he retreated to Jamaica in 2012 to team up with producers Ariel Rechtshaid and Dre Skull on Snoop Lion's (Snoop Dogg) 2013 album  ""Reincarnated"". Major Lazer was also featured on the title track from No Doubt's 2012 comeback album with famed dancehall artist Busy Signal and released an official remix for Hot Chip’s ""Look At Where We Are"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Major+Lazer"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Beatles,"The Beatles were an iconic rock group from Liverpool, England. They are frequently cited as the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in modern history, with innovative music, a cultural impact that helped define the 1960s and an enormous influence on music that is still felt today. Currently, The Beatles are one of the two musical acts to sell more than 1 billion records, with only Elvis Presley having been able to achieve the same feat.
     
After conquering Europe, with successful tours to Germany and Sweden, the Beatles led the mid-1960s musical 'British Invasion' into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored a great variety of musical styles including Psychedelic Rock, Experimental, Ballads, Western and Indian Classical among others. Their clothes, hairstyles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. 
     
Early on, the band consisted of George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best. The band got its first major break playing in Hamburg, Germany, at some rather seedy nightclubs, beginning in 1960. While in Germany, they also met Klaus Voormann, who would later design the cover of the group's 1966 album Revolver. Sutcliffe remained in Germany when the others returned to England and became engaged to fellow artist Astrid Kirchherr, only to die a few years later of a brain hemorrhage. 

In 1961, Brian Epstein heard their sound and was thrilled enough to sign on as their manager, even though he had no previous experience in that field. After Decca Records rejected the band with the famous comment ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein"", his efforts eventually led, in 1962, to an audition with EMI producer George Martin, who signed them to EMI's Parlaphone label. 

Later, due in part to Martin's refusal to use him on recordings, Pete Best was replaced by Ringo Starr, the drummer from another big Liverpool band known as Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Ringo was supposed to play on their first single, ""Love Me Do"", but George Martin had Andy White, a session drummer, play instead (Ringo can be heard on the album version of the song).
     
In 1963, The Beatles initiated a craze known as ""Beatlemania"" in the UK with the song ""Please Please Me"". Their first album of the same title was recorded in just one day. This fame spread internationally and, in February of 1964, they arrived in the United States. Their first appearance in the States was on the Ed Sullivan Show, following ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" going #1 in the States. With this success, the Beatles released two feature length films within the space of two years: A Hard Day's Night and Help!. The songs from both films were penned by Lennon and McCartney, and albums followed their release. In Help!, the Beatles were given greater creative freedom, deciding for example to head to the exotic location of the Bahamas simply to shoot one scene.  
     
The Beatles were comprised of four members in the long run: John Lennon (vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Paul McCartney (vocals, bass guitar, piano, guitar), George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals), and Ringo Starr (percussion, vocals). Lennon and McCartney were the main songwriters and singers, although songs penned by George started showing up more frequently on later albums. Ringo traditionally sang one song on each record. George Martin produced most of the Beatles' records, and was a highly influential part of the band's sound on most of their records. He also played the renowned solo on ""In My Life"" (Rubber Soul). 
     
For years, The Beatles showed an amazing talent for writing hit after hit. In 1966, they ceased performing in concert (apparently they grew weary of the constant screaming from the fans, which always got so loud they could never hear themselves play; another contributing factor was the extraordinary lengths they had to go to for security reasons before and after each performance) and began exploring new sounds in the studio. This is especially apparent in albums such as Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Beatles, sometimes known as ""The White Album"". The White Album  is considered the band's most experimental. The novel sounds featured are due to the growing presence of Yoko Ono (Lennon's wife), as demonstrated by the song ""Revolution 9"", and the band's increasing use of drugs. The song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" (from Sgt. Pepper's) was rumored to be an ode to LSD, although the band vehemently denied any link; they instead insisted that it described a drawing made by John Lennon's son, Julian Lennon. After the death of Brian Epstein, the Beatles began to unravel at the seams. The Beatles officially split at the dawn of 1970; Lennon had unofficially quit the previous year and the band had maintained the front of being together to protect their business interests. McCartney, who was the first to announce that he had officially ""quit"" the band and that they no longer existed, was often blamed for the band's ending although by the end he was the only one willing to carry on and was, by stating the group no longer existed, admitting to the facts.  
     
The Beatles never reunited properly in the 1970s as they never fully recovered from the acrimony associated with their breakup. They did, however, make two new records in 1994, despite Lennon's 1980 death, for the Anthology project. ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love"" were based on demo tapes made by Lennon and sent to McCartney by his widow Yoko Ono. They charted in the UK at #2 and #4 respectively.
  
The Beatles also created some of the first music videos, having filmed promotional films in 1965 for broadcasters to show across the US and Europe rather than have to appear live. Their 1967 film promos for ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Penny Lane"" have even more similarity to modern music videos, with each one created for just the individual song, and without the appearance of being a recording of a live performance. 

The Beatles were also the source of a number of controversies and conspiracy theories. John Lennon was quoted in 1966 as saying the Beatles were ""more popular than Jesus Christ"", causing protests in many parts of the USA; although he publicly apologized for the statement, he also later claimed it was a contributing factor in the Beatles ending touring. 

A widespread urban legend that started in 1969 claimed that Paul McCartney was dead and had been replaced by a lookalike. The rumor was referred to by members of the Beatles a number of times, including John Lennon's song ""How Do You Sleep?"".
   
George Harrison passed away in 2001. His death was marked by a large concert event in the Albert Hall. The Concert for George took place a year to the day of George's death. Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney continue to make music. Ringo released Choose Love and Paul released Chaos and Creation in the Backyard both in 2005. Paul's latest release is 2007's Memory Almost Full. Also in 2008 Ringo released Liverpool 8.

George Harrison once said “The Beatles will exist without us.” Deftly short and simple, this quote surmises their legacy, showing how The Beatles as an entity transcends not only the music or entertainment industry, but even the members themselves. 
     
In 2006, a collaboration between Apple Corps, and Cirque du Soleil, culminated in a show called Love, showing only in Las Vegas. Starr, McCartney, Ono and Harrison's widow, Olivia, all were involved in the production. The accompanying album is composed of new takes on original Beatles recordings, spliced together and creating new feels for several of their songs. The project was put together by renowned Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles.  
     
The tracks in ""Love"" contain parts from original Beatles demo recordings, and George Martin created a new orchestral arrangement for an acoustic demo version of Harrison's ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"". 

In October 2007, Across the Universe, a musical film which incorporated Beatles songs into its narrative, was released in cinemas to mixed reviews. The film incorporates, and indeed appears to be built around, various songs throughout the Beatles' career, sung by the principles. Songs such as ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""Dear Prudence"" actually tell the story at hand, while songs such as ""Let it Be"" and ""Across the Universe"" seem instead to provide a background or atmosphere around which the story is built. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Kanye West,"Kanye Omari West (born June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia) is a Grammy award winning rapper, producer, author, designer and singer. 

He began making beats and rapping in the early 90s in Chicago, IL, United States when he formed the rap group Go Getters with Chicago natives GLC and Really Doe. He later gained nationwide popularity in New York when he began producing tracks for artists such as Jay-Z, Twista, Mase, Talib Kweli and Alicia Keys. 

West’s style of production often utilizes pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul songs, with his own drums and instruments. The first major label song he produced was The Truth by Beanie Sigel, and his first major release featuring his trademark vocal sampling style was This Can’t Be Life, a track from Jay-Z’s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West said he sped up the drum beat of Dr. Dre’s Xxplosive to use as a replacement for his drums on This Can’t Be Life.

West has said that Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA influenced him in his style, and has said on numerous occasions that Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah and Ol’ Dirty Bastard were some of his all-time favorites. Said by Kanye West: “Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time… We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the [production] style I use, RZA has been doing that.”

In 2004 (after being pushed aside by many record companies who felt he wasn't a marketable hip hop artist), he managed to release his debut solo album, The College Dropout on Roc-A-Fella Records. The album received critical acclaim, defining the style for which West would become known: ""wordplay"" and heavy sampling of 70s soul and RnB tracks. He is also known for his politically-charged rhymes and controversial behavior both inside and outside the realms of music.

He has since released five more albums, all of which have received numerous awards, high commercial success and critical acclaim. Late Registration (2005); Graduation (2007); 808s & Heartbreak (2008); My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010); Yeezus (2013).

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to rave reviews from critics, many of whom described it as his best work that solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark Fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit All of the Lights, and Billboard hits Power, Monster, and Runaway, the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name. During this time, West initiated the free music program G.O.O.D. Fridays through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday of the week, a portion of which were included on the album. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a ""snub"" by several media outlets.

Following a headlining set at Coachella 2011 that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as ""one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time,"" West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z. By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak. Niggas in Paris became the record's highest charting single, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2012, West released the compilation album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks by artists from West's record label GOOD Music. Cruel Summer produced four singles, two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100: Mercy and Clique. West also directed a film of the same name that premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens.

Sessions for West's sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft's living room at a Paris hotel. Determined to ""undermine the commercial,"" he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Primarily inspired by architecture, West's perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach. Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances.

Yeezus, West's sixth album, was released June 18, 2013 to rave reviews from critics. It became the rapper's sixth consecutive number one debut. Def Jam issued ""Black Skinhead"" to radio in July 2013 as the album's lead single. On September 6, 2013, Kanye West announced he would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support Yeezus, with fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar, accompanying him along the way.

In November 2013, West stated that he was working on and recording his next studio album. The album is being produced by Rick Rubin and Q-Tip. In April 2014, he appeared in Future's new single titled I Won. Kanye released the first single from the album on December 31, 2014 entitled Only One. All Day the second single from Kanye's new album was released on March 2, 2015. West had originally stated the album would be called 'So Help Me God' but in May, 2015, changed the album title to 'SWISH'. 

Personal life:
West was born in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was three years old (as mentioned in Hey Mama) his parents divorced, and he moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, was a former Black Panther; one of the first black photojournalists at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution; and is now a Christian counselor. Kanye’s late mother, Dr. Donda West, worked as a Professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as Kanye’s manager. He was later raised in an upper middle class background, attending Polaris High School in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois after living in Chicago.

After attending The American Academy of Art, a Chicago art school, West attended Chicago State University but eventually dropped out due to poor grades and in order to continue working on his music career. While attending school, West produced for local artists, including on rapper Grav’s debut album Down to Earth. He later gained fame by producing hit singles for major hip hop/R&B artists, including Jay-Z, Talib Kweli, Cam’ron, Paul Wall, Common, Mobb Deep, Jermaine Dupri, Scarface, The Game, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson and John Legend among others. He also “ghost-produced” for his once mentor Deric Angelettie according to his song Last Call and the credits of Nas’ Poppa Was a Playa.

Kanye is married to Kim Kardashian. They have one child together named North.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Arctic Monkeys,"Arctic Monkeys are an indie rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.

The band has released five studio albums, ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"" (2006), ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" (2007), ""Humbug"" (2009), ""Suck It and See"" (2011) and ""AM"" (2013), all of which debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart. 

Each of the band's first five singles I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor, When the Sun Goes Down, Leave Before The Lights Come On, Brianstorm and Fluorescent Adolescent hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, Teddy Picker, only went Top 20 and their seventh single, Crying Lightning peaked at #12.

The band's rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs which had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website.  The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical 'commercial' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK's (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.

The band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis's album Spirit.

On 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to 'fatigue' and the other band members couldn't stand the constant 'missing his girlfriend syndrome' so told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist,  Nick O'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band's remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson's permanent replacement. 

The single Leave Before The Lights Come On came out on August 14th, but only reached Number 4 on the UK charts, denying the band a third consecutive number 1 single.

Their debut album ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"" won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.

Their second album Favourite Worst Nightmare was released on April 23rd 2007. It was preceded by ""Brianstorm"", the first single from the album, which was released a week before. Like its predecessor, ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" sold more than the rest of the Top 20 combined, and - due to an error on iTunes - every song on the record appeared on the UK Top 200 Singles the next week.

When asked about Favourite Worst Nightmare Alex Turner commented, ""We haven't changed that much. It's still about making contact with girls or not making contact with girls"".

The band began to write and record demos for the third album in January 2008, Turner said ""We had tunes that we'd already been playing on tour so we recorded them. That’s six [songs]. We’re going to take it easy and start practicing over the summer and doing new stuff.""

The band premiered new material from the unreleased album during their January 2009 tour of New Zealand, playing small venues in Wellington and Auckland ahead of the Big Day Out festival. Their first show in more than a year was on January 13, 2009 at Wellington's Town Hall. In both cities, the new songs played were ""Crying Lightning"", ""Go-Kart"", ""Dangerous Animals"" and ""Pretty Visitors."" The full set list from the Auckland gig is available online. Also played was a cover of the Nick Cave song ""Red Right Hand."" During their last tour, the band had played new songs ""Put Me In A Terror Pocket"", ""Sandtrap,"" and ""The Fire and The Thud"" live.

Lead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the singer from the Rascals, Miles Kane.
The band is called 'The Last Shadow Puppets'

The band released their new album Humbug in August of 2009, preceded by the single "" Crying Lightning""

They released their fourth studio album, entitled Suck It And See on June 6th 2011

Kings of Leon,"Kings of Leon is an American rock band that formed in Nashville, Tennessee, United States in 1999, consisting of brothers Anthony ""Caleb"" Followill (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Ivan ""Nathan"" Followill (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and Michael ""Jared"" Followill (bass guitar, backing vocals), with their cousin Cameron ""Matthew"" Followill (lead guitar, backing vocals). Each member of the family group is known by their middle name (second given name) as opposed to their first given name.

The band's early music was an upbeat blend of southern rock and blues influences but the band has gradually expanded their sound to include a variety of genres, including alternative rock.

Kings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards in 2008, and all three of the band's albums at the time peaking in the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album Because of the Times also reached the number one spot. After the release of Only by the Night in 2008 they finally achieved chart success in their native United States. The singles Sex on Fire, Use Somebody and Notion peaked at number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, while the album itself was their first ever platinum-selling album in the US. 

Early years (1999–2002)
The three Followill brothers spent much of their youth traveling around the Southern United States with their father, Ivan ""Leon"" Followill, a traveling Pentecostal Church preacher and their mother, Betty-Ann, who taught them when they were not in school. Caleb and Jared were both born in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, while Nathan and Matthew were born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. According to Rolling Stone magazine, ""While Leon preached at churches and tent revivals throughout the Deep South, the boys attended services and were occasionally enlisted to bang on some drums. They were either home-schooled or enrolled in small parochial schools at this time. Except for a five-year period when they settled in Jackson, Tennessee, the Followill's childhoods were spent driving through the south in a purple 1988 Oldsmobile, decamping for a week or two wherever Leon was scheduled to preach.""

When the boys' father resigned from the church and divorced his wife in 1997, the boys relocated to Nashville and embraced the rock music and lifestyle they had previously been denied. While there, they met songwriter Angelo Petraglia, who helped the siblings hone their songwriting skills and introduced them to the musical influences of the Rolling Stones, The Clash, and Thin Lizzy in particular. Six months later, Nathan and Caleb signed with RCA Records, who insisted that the duo recruit more members for the band before launching their career. The band was formed when cousin Matthew and younger brother Jared were asked to join. They named themselves Kings of Leon in honor of Nathan, Caleb, and Jared's father and grandfather, who were both named Leon.

In an interview, Caleb admitted to ""kidnapping"" their cousin Matthew from his hometown in Mississippi in order for him to join the band. They told his mother that he was just staying for a week, but they consequently never allowed him to return home. Drummer Nathan added, ""When we signed the deal with RCA, it was just me and Caleb. The label told us they were going to put a band together, but we said, 'We're going to buy our little brother a bass, he's a freshman in high school. Caleb will teach himself the guitar. Our cousin Matthew played guitar when he was 10 and I'll play drums.' The record label agreed,"". 

Youth and Young Manhood and Aha Shake Heartbreak (2003 - 2005)
Their first record, the Holy Roller Novocaine EP was released on February 18, 2003. At this stage, Jared was only 16 years old and had not yet learned to play the bass guitar. The release of Holy Roller Novocaine gave the Kings of Leon a significant amount of exposure prior to the release of their debut album, Youth and Young Manhood, receiving a 4/5 star rating from Rolling Stone magazine. Four of the five songs would later be released on Youth and Young Manhood, however the versions of Wasted Time and California Waiting on the EP differ, with the first having a more tense riff and different vocal style than the same track off Youth and Young Manhood, and the latter being recorded in a rush to finish the record. The EP contains the B-side Wicker Chair while another track titled Andrea, was discarded prior to its release. All the songs released on the EP were co-written by Angelo Petraglia who also produced the record.

The band's debut studio album, Youth and Young Manhood was released in the UK in July 2003, and in the United States in August of the same year. The album was recorded between Sound City Studios in Los Angeles and Shangri-La Studios in Malibu, California, with producer Ethan Johns (son of producer Glyn Johns who most notably worked with the Rolling Stones and the Eagles). The album received some critical notice domestically, but became a sensation in the UK and Ireland, where NME declared it ""one of the best debut album of the last 10 years"". Following the release of the album, Kings of Leon was chosen to tour with fellow American rock band The Strokes and U2.

The band's second album Aha Shake Heartbreak was released in the UK in October 2004 and in the United States in February 2005. Building on the southern-infused garage rock of their first album, the album broadened the band's domestic and international audience. The album was again produced by Angelo Petraglia and Ethan Johns. The Bucket, Four Kicks, and King of the Rodeo were all released as singles, with the ""The Bucket"" rising into the Top 20 in Britain. Taper Jean Girl was also used in the 2007 movie Disturbia and the movie Cloverfield in 2008. The band garnered accolades from several of their rock peers, including Elvis Costello, and also toured with Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam during 2005 and 2006.

Because of the Times (2006–07)
In March 2006, Kings of Leon were back in the studio with their producers Angelo Petraglia and Ethan Johns, working on their third album. Guitarist Matthew told NME: ""Man, we're sitting on a bunch of songs right now that we wish we could let the world hear"". The band's third album was titled Because of the Times, which may be a reference to a church ministers conference of the same name held at The Pentecostals of Alexandria church in Alexandria, Louisiana that the brothers often attended. The album showed a clear evolution from Kings of Leon's previous work, as the band's trademark dirty, southern-fried swagger was replaced with a more polished, clean-cut sound.

The album was released on April 2, 2007 in the UK, and a day later in the United States, preceded by the single On Call, which became a hit in Britain and Ireland. It debuted at number one in Britain and Ireland and entered the European charts at number twenty-five, selling approximately 70,000 copies in its first week of release. NME said that the album ""cements Kings of Leon as one of the great American bands of our times."" and Entertainment Weekly called Because of the Times ""an epic wide-screen movie of a CD and the band's best to date."" However, some critics found the album inferior to their previous efforts. Stylus Magazine rated it a C- and noted ""If they wanted us to take them serious this time around, they'd at least try to be right honest about their ascent into minor celebrity and not keep on with the yokel façade. Without cautionary yarns regarding life on the tour bus or banging supermodels, the bright-eyed, legs-stretched mood of the music rings just as hollow."" Dave Hood of Artrocker gave the album one star out of five, finding that ""Kings of Leon are experimenting, learning, and getting a bit lost."" Pitchfork Media contended that ""Because of the Times sounds suspiciously like a counterattack on womankind, launched from somewhere in the mid-1990s, deep inside a bruised, stadium-sized ego.""

In spite of the mixed recognition, the album spawned a number of hit singles in Europe, including Charmer and Fans, along with a number of crowd favorites such as Knocked Up and My Party.

Only by the Night (2008–09)
After recording throughout most of 2008, ""the all American long haired rockers"" (The Times), released their fourth studio album Only by the Night on September 19, which subsequently entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and remained there for one more week. Only By The Night also had two single week stints as the UK #1 album in 2009, one directly after the BRIT Awards. In the United States, the album reached number 5 on the Billboard Charts. Reception to the album was the most polarized yet, with the British press granting the album glowing reviews. Q Magazine named Only by the Night ""Album of the Year"" for 2008. In the United States, reactions to the album were more mixed. Spin, Rolling Stone, and All Music Guide gave the album positive reviews, while Pitchfork Media gave the album a virtual equivalent of 2 stars. The album was officially named as the UK's third biggest selling album of 2008 and the biggest selling album of 2008 in Australia. Sex on Fire was the first single released for download in the UK on 8 September. The song became their most successful ever as it peaked at number one in the UK and in Ireland. It was also their first song to chart number one on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock chart. The second single to be released from the album on December 8, 2008 was Use Somebody which achieved worldwide chart success and consistency, such as peaking at number two in the UK Singles Chart, and also reaching top ten chart positions in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States. The album's popularity in Australia was confirmed with a total of four singles being voted into the world's largest online music poll, the ""Triple J Hottest 100"". The song Crawl came in at number 70, Closer was voted number 24 and ""Use Somebody"" finished number 3 in the poll. However, their biggest success from Only By The Night was ""Sex on Fire"" which was voted number 1 in the Hottest 100 poll for 2008 and number 90 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009 poll. ""Sex on Fire"" also won the band a Grammy Award at the 51st Grammy Awards held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on February 8, 2009. They won Best International Band and Best International Album at the Brit Awards in 2009, where they also performed ""Use Somebody"" live. Kings of Leon also performed on 14 March 2009 at Sound Relief, a benefit concert, for the Victorian Bushfire Crisis. The song ""Crawl"" from this album was released as a free download on the band's website on July 28. The third and fourth singles were Revelry, which peaked at number 19 in New Zealand and Notion, which peaked at number 24 in Belgian charts. Only By The Night was certified platinum in the United States by the RIAA for selling one million copies in less than a year after its release.

In 2009, the band headlined a number of music festivals, including Reading & Leeds, Rock Werchter, Oxegen, T In The Park, Gurtenfestival and Open'er Festival in Europe, along with Sasquatch, Lollapalooza, and Austin City Limits in the United States. That same year, the band won their first Grammy Award for the single ""Sex on Fire"", as well as two BRIT Awards for ""Best International Group"" and ""Best International Album."" The album Only by the Night also won an NME Award for ""Album of the Year.""

Future projects (2009-2011)
The band has announced the release of a live DVD on November 10, 2009 and a remix album due for release in the coming months, though the latter is untitled and unscheduled at the moment. The DVD was filmed at London's O2 Arena in July 2009. In an interview with Billboard.com drummer Nathan stated, ""England is really the first place we broke ... We figured what better place to make a live DVD than where the fans have been the craziest for the longest?"" The show featured some choice rarities, and Nathan continued by saying ""we just put the cameras in the back of our minds and acted like they weren't even there."" The remix album came to life after Kings of Leon learned that other artists had started working on revisions of the band's songs. Mark Ronson, Kenna, Lykke Li with her cover of ""Knocked Up"", and Linkin Park are also contributing a remix to the album.

On October 17, 2009, the night of the final show of the US tour in Nashville, Tennessee, Nathan Followill posted ""Now it's time to start creating the next musical chapter in the novel that is Kings of Leon. Thanks again to all. Boomer fucking Sooner."" on his personal Twitter page.

Mechanical Bull (2012-2013):
The band's sixth LP, ""Mechanical Bull"", was released on September 24, 2013. The album's first single, entitled ""Supersoaker"", was released on July 17, 2013.

Walls (2016):
On Oct 14, 2016, Kings of Leon released their 7th studio album, ""Walls"", on the RCA Records label. It became the band's first number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The first single released from the album was ""Waste a Moment"".

Controversy
Kings of Leon caused controversy at the 2009 Reading Festival when Caleb Followill tried to get the crowd going by asking ""I thought this was supposed to be the loudest crowd in the world?"" Picking up on a perceived hostility towards the band, he announced ""we know you're sick of Kings of Leon, so for all those who don't give a fuck about us, I understand. But we've worked fucking hard to get here. So anyone that has anything to say to us, fuck you. We're the goddamn Kings of Leon."" The band later smashed their guitars in anger and made rude gestures before leaving the stage. Nathan Followill further criticized the Reading crowd on his twitter page, declaring ""Zero love for the kings. I know it was cold but holy shit, y'all were frozen. I can only hope Leeds is in better form."". At the Leeds Festival Caleb again bad-mouthed Reading while complimenting the Leeds crowd declaring ""We're only five songs in and you've blown Reading to hell"", while complimenting UK crowds in general stating ""It was the UK that made us feel like we could take on the world.""

Queen,"Queen were an English rock band originally consisting of four members: vocalist Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, bass guitarist John Deacon, and drummer Roger Taylor.

The band formed in London in 1970 after May and Taylor's former band Smile split after having released an album and single. Freddie replaced lead vocalist Tim Staffell, after the latter's departure from the original trio. 

There was much deliberation as to what the band's name would be. May and Taylor had settled upon the Grand Dance, derived from a C.S. Lewis Trilogy of books Out Of The Silent Planet.

Ultimately, the band went with Queen, a name that was entirely Freddie's. Originally Roger and, especially, Brian did not like the name, though Mercury would eventually persuade them both that it was ""right"" for the band.

""Years ago I thought up the name Queen... It's just a name, but it's very regal, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it. ""
- Freddie Mercury.

Queen went through several bass players before  a young electronics major by the name of John Deacon arrived on the scene in January of 1971. 

""Until John, it had been exploding bass player syndrome. If they musically worked they'd look all wrong, and if they felt all right they couldn't play. - Brian May.

This quite shy guy turned up with his immaculate Rickenbacker bass and immaculate amplifier, plugged in, and as soon as he started playing we realized it was right."" - Brian May.

Later that year, the band was secured recording time at the newly built De Lane Lea studio, and used the opportunity to record several songs that would later appear on their debut album - Liar, Keep Yourself Alive, Jesus, and The Night Comes Down.  The demo reel was passed around from producer to producer with little success, until a staff member of Trident records by the name of Roy Thomas Baker was introduced to the band by fellow Trident producer John Anthony. Baker dropped in to watch the band at work and, clearly liking what he heard, recommended Queen to his superiors. 

It was eventually agreed upon that the fledgling band could record at Trident studios, though after already-established artists had finished their work, such as the likes of Elton John and David Bowie. Relegated to the wee hours of the morning to record the remaining tracks of their first album, the band nonetheless stuck it out until they reached their ultimate goal of ""perfection"".

Queen's self-titled debut album was released in 1973 and received little attention from the general public. They quickly followed it a year later with a second album, ""Queen II"" which also failed to generate much interest from music fans in Britain, despite the success of the album's single, Seven Seas of Rhye, which would reach #10 on the charts after the band's mimed appearance on Top of the Pops. 

The band's second album was recorded with a higher budget than the first, and the band threw everything they had into recording it. Queen II was somewhat of a ""concept album"", split into ""White Side"" vs. ""Black Side"". 

As was in their nature, the band pressed onward after the mediocre success of their first two albums, immersing themselves in a world-wide tour to promote Queen II. Queen played in America for the first time, as a support act for Mott the Hoople.

Sheer Heart Attack would be released later that year, focusing more on being accessible to listeners, than the grand and complex ideas of the previous two albums. The recording of their third album was met with some hardships, as May fell victim to a series of illnesses brought on by an infected inoculation, required for the band's rigorous touring schedule. 

Sheer Heart Attack brought even more success for the band, with May's Now I'm Here and the song that would be the band's ""turning point"", the Mercury-penned Killer Queen, the latter of which would reach #2 on the UK charts.

During this time, the band began developing a huge following in Japan and witnessed their popularity for themselves when they visited the country, mainly in 1975, to promote their fourth and most famous album ""A Night At The Opera"", featuring the epic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".

Queen's popularity grew steadily through the latter half of the 70s as they released hit album after hit album, reaching its peak in the mid-80s after their ""Live Aid"" appearance, and continuing into the early 90s before Mercury's untimely death on 24th November 1991. The official cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.

Over the course of their 30 year career, the band did sound tracks for two films (""Flash Gordon"" and ""Highlander""), released a string of live and studio albums, and had many many fans across the world.

In 1995, 4 years after Mercury's death, the band released the album ""Made In Heaven"". This album saw the surviving band members in the studio completing or reworking unused vocals, unreleased variations of Freddie solo material (a Queen version of ""I Was Born To Love You"" for example), and tracks where Brian and Roger added lyrics to flesh out a song (""Mother Love""). 

Queen have been on indefinite hiatus since 1997, when John Deacon decided to retire.


Several ""Queen + ..."" projects have been developed in the following years, a few of them mere remixes with no artistic involvement from the band. In 1999, a ""Greatest Hits III"" album was released. This featured, among others, ""Queen + Wyclef Jean"" on a rap version of ""Another One Bites the Dust"", a live version of ""Somebody to Love"" performed by George Michael, and a live version of ""The Show Must Go On"" performed live in 1997 with Elton John.

Brian May and Roger Taylor have performed together as Queen on several occasions (award ceremonies, charity concerts, and the like), sharing vocals with various guest singers. They have also recorded several covers of Queen's hits with guest vocalists, including ""We Will Rock You"" (first with Five and later Britney Spears, Beyonce, John Farnham and P!nk) and ""We Are the Champions"" (with Robbie Williams).

On the 14th of May 2002 the Queen musical 'We Will Rock You'  opened in the Dominion theatre in London's 'West End'. A Musical about young people in the distant future who aren't allowed to listen to music not generated by computers. Various Queen songs are used in the story, played by a live band. This live band was supported by Brian May and Roger Taylor on the premiere evening.

At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be 'featured with' Queen as 'Queen + Paul Rodgers', not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.

Between 2005 and 2006 Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, the first leg in Europe and the second, Japan and then the US in 2006. On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a ""secret location"". The album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the album the band again embarked on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The show in Ukraine was later released on DVD.

Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009. Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working together again.

The Rolling Stones,"The Rolling Stones are an English rock group that formed in London in 1962. First popular in Europe, they quickly became successful in North America during the ""British Invasion"" of the mid-60s. Since then, their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004, they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on ""The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists"", and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ian Stewart, who met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called ""Rollin' Stone Blues"", and made their live debut at London's Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier).

In January 1963, Charlie Watts  joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer's Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham.  Their weekly performances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond's Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the ""Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone"" press campaign, which set the tone for their career.

In May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later ""Come On"", the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.

The fifth member of the group, Brian Jones, left on 8th June 1969, saying that he wanted to form a new group. He was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.

In 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label.  In December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career.  He was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood.

Since Wyman left the Stones in 1993, the band has consisted of Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood. In studio and live performances, Darryl Jones (bassist) and Chuck Leavell (keyboardist) also serve as a regular contributors. 

In 2005, the band released ""A Bigger Bang"". 

On December 2, 2016, the band released their first studio album in over 10 days, entitled ""Blue & Lonesome"" (2016) on the Polydor label. 

All the members have also undertaken solo projects of various kinds. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Ariana Grande,"Ariana Grande (born Ariana Grande-Butera, June 26, 1993 in Boca Raton, Florida, United States), is an American Grammy award-nominated actress, singer, and songwriter. Beginning by taking a part in the Broadway musical 13 in 2008, Grande later landed the role Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon hit TV shows Victorious (2010-2013), and its spin off, Sam & Cat (2013-2014).

Grande reached mainstream success in March 2013 after her debut single ""The Way"" (featuring Mac Miller) from her debut studio album Yours Truly (2013), became a Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit. The album also debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 138,000 copies.

In August 2014, Grande released her second studio album My Everything, which became her second number one album in the US with 169,000 copies sold first week. Its lead single, ""Problem"" (featuring Iggy Azalea), reached number two on Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. With four Top 10 hit singles from the album, Grande spent 34 continuous weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and had the most top 10 singles of any artist in 2014. All of five singles from My Everything were certified Platinum or better by RIAA.

In October 2015, Grande released the lead single from her upcoming third studio album, Focus, which became her first song to crack into the Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 without a company artist. Grande also became the first artist in history to have all of three lead singles from three first albums to debut in the Top 10 Hot 100 with The Way, Problem, and Focus.

Grande has released Christmas music every winter since her career debut, Christmas Kisses (2013), which included ""Santa Tell Me"" (2014) in the exclusive re-release in Japan, and Christmas & Chill (2015), which debuted at number thirty-four on Billboard 200 chart with 27,000 digital copies. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Pink Floyd,"Pink Floyd are a psychedelic/progressive rock band formed in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom in 1965. Pink Floyd is one of rock's most successful and influential acts, having sold over 200 million albums worldwide and with 74.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time. Currently the band consists of David Gilmour (vocals, guitar) and Nick Mason (drums).

The band's classic lineup was Roger Waters (vocals, bass), David Gilmour (vocals, guitar), Rick Wright (organ, keyboards, vocals) and Nick Mason (drums). Gilmour was brought into the band in 1968 to replace the band's founder, singer, guitarist and songwriter Syd Barrett, who had become increasingly erratic and departed from the band a few months after Gilmour's addition. The band became known for their advancements in the genres of psychedelic rock and progressive rock music, philosophical lyrics, avant-garde compositions, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art and elaborate live shows. 

Pink Floyd enjoyed modest success in the late-1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett. Barrett’s increasingly erratic behavior eventually caused his colleagues to replace him after The Piper at the Gates Of Dawn with guitarist David Gilmour. The band went on to record several elaborate concept albums; achieving worldwide success with 1973’s The Dark Side of the Moon (The second best-selling album of all time), 1975’s Wish You Were Here, 1977’s Animals, and 1979’s The Wall, among the best-selling, most critically acclaimed, and enduringly popular albums in rock music history. In 1985, singer and bassist Roger Waters declared Pink Floyd defunct. However, the remaining members continued recording and touring under the name, eventually reaching a settlement with Waters giving them rights to the name and most of the songs.

Pink Floyd evolved from an earlier band, formed in 1964, which was at various times called Sigma 6, The Meggadeaths, The Screaming Abdabs, and The Abdabs. When this band split up, some members — guitarists Bob Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright — formed a new band called Tea Set, and were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist Syd Barrett, who became the band’s primary vocalist as well. When Tea Set found themselves on the same bill as another band with the same name, Barrett came up with an alternative name on the spur of the moment, choosing The Pink Floyd Sound (after two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). For a time after this they oscillated between ‘Tea Set’ and ‘The Pink Floyd Sound’, with the latter name eventually winning out. The word Sound was dropped fairly quickly, but the definite article was still used occasionally for several years afterward, up to about the time of the More soundtrack. In the early days, the band covered rhythm and blues staples such as “Louie, Louie”, but gained notoriety for psychedelic interpretations, with extended improvised sections and ‘spaced out’ solos.

The heavily jazz-oriented Klose left the band to become a photographer shortly before Pink Floyd started recording, leaving an otherwise stable lineup with Barrett on lead guitar, Waters on bass guitar, Mason on drums and Wright switching to keyboards. Barrett started writing his own songs, influenced by American and British psychedelic rock with his own brand of whimsical humor. Pink Floyd became a favorite in the underground movement, playing at such prominent venues as the UFO club, the Marquee Club and the Roundhouse. As their popularity increased, the band members formed Blackhill Enterprises in October 1966, a six-way business partnership with their managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, issuing the singles ""Arnold Layne"" in March 1967 and “See Emily Play” in June 1967. “Arnold Layne” reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and “See Emily Play” reached number 6, granting the band its first TV appearance on Top of the Pops in July 1967.

Released in August 1967, the band’s debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, is today considered to be a prime example of British psychedelic music, and was generally well-received by critics at the time, and it is now viewed as one of the better debut albums by many critics. The album’s tracks, predominantly written by Barrett, showcase poetic lyrics and an eclectic mixture of music, from the avant-garde free-form piece ""Interstellar Overdrive"" to whimsical songs such as ""The Scarecrow"", inspired by the Fenlands, a rural region north of Cambridge (Barrett, Gilmour and Waters’s home town). Lyrics were entirely surreal and often referred to folklore, such as ""The Gnome"". The music reflected newer technologies in electronics through its prominent use of stereo panning and electric keyboards. The album was a hit in the UK where it peaked at #6, but did not get much attention in North America, reaching #131 in the U.S. During this period, the band toured with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which helped to increase its popularity.

As the band became more and more popular, the stresses of life on the road and a significant intake of psychedelic drugs took their toll on Barrett, whose mental health had been deteriorating for several months. While Barrett’s behavior has often been attributed to his drug use, there are many who think that a pre-existing condition, possibly schizophrenia, was equally to blame. In January 1968, guitarist David Gilmour joined the band to carry out Syd’s playing and singing duties. With Barrett’s behavior becoming less and less predictable, and his almost constant use of LSD, he became very unstable, often staring into space while the rest of the band performed. During some performances, he would simply strum one chord for the duration of a concert, or simply begin detuning his guitar. The band’s live shows became increasingly ramshackle until, eventually, the other band members simply stopped taking him to the concerts. It was originally hoped that Syd would write for the band with Gilmour performing live, similar to how the Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson. However, due to Barrett’s increasingly difficult compositions, such as ""Have You Got It Yet?”, which changed melodies and chord progression with every take, eventually made the rest of the band give up on this arrangement. Once Barrett’s departure was formalized in April 1968, producers Jenner and King decided to remain with him, and the six-way Blackhill partnership was dissolved. The band adopted Steve O’Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd until his death in 2003.

Musically, this period was one of experimentation for the band. Gilmour, Waters and Wright each contributed material that had its own voice and sound, giving this material less consistency than the Barrett-dominated early years or the more polished, collaborative sound of later years. Waters mostly wrote low-key, jazzy melodies with dominant bass lines and complex, symbolic lyrics, Gilmour focused on guitar-driven blues jams, and Wright preferred melodic psychedelic keyboard-heavy numbers. Unlike Waters, Gilmour and Wright preferred tracks that had simple lyrics or that were purely instrumental. Some of the band’s most experimental music is from this period, such as ""A Saucerful of Secrets"", consisting largely of feedback and atonal screeches and loops, “Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict”, which is a series of sped-up voice samples resembling rodents chattering that reaches its climax in an incomprehensible Scottish dialect monologue, and “Careful with That Axe, Eugene” (performed under different names during this period), a very Waters-driven song with a bass and keyboard-heavy jam culminating in crashing drums and Waters’s primal screams.

Whilst Barrett had written the bulk of the first album, only one Barrett composition, the Piper outtake “Jugband Blues”, appeared on the second Floyd album. A Saucerful of Secrets was released in June 1968, reaching #9 in the UK and becoming the only Pink Floyd album not to chart in the U.S. Somewhat uneven due to Barrett’s departure, the album still contained much of his psychedelic sound combined with the more experimental music that would be fully showcased on Ummagumma. Hints of the epic, lengthy songs to come are in its centerpiece, the 12-minute title track, but the album was poorly received by critics at the time, although critics today tend to be kinder to the album in the context of their body of work. Future Floyd albums would expand upon the idea of long, sprawling compositions, offering more focused songwriting with each subsequent release.

Pink Floyd were then recruited by director Barbet Schroeder to produce a soundtrack for his film, More, which premiered in May 1969. The music was released as a Floyd album in its own right, Music From the Film More, in July 1969; the album achieved another #9 finish in the UK, and peaked at #153 in the U.S. The band would use this and future soundtrack recording sessions to produce work that may not have fit into the idea of what would appear on a proper Pink Floyd LP; many of the tracks on More (as fans usually call it) were acoustic folk songs, although critics tend to find the collection of the film’s music patchy and uneven. Two of these songs, “Green Is the Colour” and “Cymbaline”, became fixtures in the band’s live sets for a time, as can be heard in the many available bootleg recordings from this period. The latter was also the first Pink Floyd song to deal with Roger Waters’s cynical attitude toward the music industry explicitly. The rest of the album consisted of incidental music with a few heavier rock songs thrown in, such as “The Nile Song”.

The next record, the double album Ummagumma, was a mix of live recordings and unchecked studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project (Mason’s first wife makes an uncredited contribution as a flautist). Though the album was realized as solo outings and a live set, it was originally intended as a purely avant-garde mixture of sounds from “found” instruments. The subsequent difficulties in recording and lack of group organization led to the shelving of the project. The title is slang for sexual procreation, and reflects the attitude of the band at the time, as frustrations in the studio followed them throughout these sessions. Wildly experimental on the studio disc (except for Waters’s pure folk “Grantchester Meadows”), with atonal and jarring piano pieces (“Sysyphus”), meandering folk guitar (“The Narrow Way”) and large percussion solos, the live disc featured excellent performances of some of their most popular psychedelic-era compositions and caused critics to receive the album more positively than the previous two albums. With fans, the album was Pink Floyd’s most popular release yet, hitting UK #5 and making the U.S. charts at #74.

1970’s Atom Heart Mother, the band’s first recording with an orchestra, was a collaboration with avant-garde composer Ron Geesin. One side of the album consisted of the title piece, a 23-minute long rock-orchestral suite. The second side featured one song from each of the band’s then-current vocalists (Roger Waters’s folk-rock “If”, David Gilmour’s bluesy “Fat Old Sun” and Rick Wright’s psychedelic “Summer ‘68”). Another lengthy piece, “Alan’s Psychedelic Breakfast”, was a sound collage of a man cooking and eating breakfast and his thoughts on the matter, linked with instrumentals. The use of incidental sound effects and voice samples would thereafter be an important part of the band’s sound. While Atom Heart Mother was considered a huge step back for the band at the time and is still considered one of its most inaccessible albums, it had the best chart performance for the band so far, reaching #1 in the UK and #55 in the U.S., although it has since been described by Gilmour as ""a load of rubbish"" and Waters as suitable for ""throwing in the dustbin and never [being] listened to by anyone ever again."" The album was another transitional piece for the group, hinting at future musical territory such as “Echoes” in its ambitious title track. The popularity of the album allowed Pink Floyd to embark on its first full U.S. tour. Before releasing its next original album, the band released a compilation album, Relics, which contained several early singles and B-sides, along with one original song (Waters’s jazzy “Biding My Time”).

This is the period in which the Floyd shed their association with the “psychedelic” scene (and its association with Barrett) and became a distinctive band that are difficult to classify. The divergent styles of Gilmour, Waters and Wright (Mason’s writing contributions to the group were minimal) were merged into a unique sound. This era contains what many consider to be two of the band’s masterpiece albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. The sound became polished and collaborative, with the philosophic lyrics and distinctive bass lines of Waters combining with the unique blues guitar style of Gilmour and Wright’s light keyboard melodies. Gilmour was the dominant vocalist throughout this period, and female choirs and Dick Parry’s saxophone contributions in the studio became a notable part of the band’s style. The sometimes atonal and harsh sound exhibited in the band’s earlier years gave way to a very smooth, mellow and soothing sound, and the band’s epic, lengthy compositions reached their zenith with “Echoes” from Meddle (although “Shine On You Crazy Diamond” exceeded it in total length, it was split in two pieces as the opening and closing of Wish You Were Here). This period was not only the beginning but the end of the truly collaborative era of the band; after 1975 Waters’s influence became more dominant musically as well as lyrically. Wright’s last credited composition and last lead vocal on a studio album until 1994’s The Division Bell were in this period, and Gilmour’s writing credits sharply declined in frequency until Waters left the band in 1985. The last ties with Barrett were severed in musical, as well as literal, fashion with Wish You Were Here, whose epic tracks “Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V)”/""Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)"" were written both as a tribute and elegy to their friend.

The band’s sound was considerably more focused on Meddle (1971), with the 23-minute epic “Echoes” taking up the second side of the LP. “Echoes” is a smooth progressive rock song with extended guitar and keyboard solos and a long segue in the middle consisting largely of synthesized whale song produced on guitar, along with samples of seagull cries, described by Waters as a “sonic poem”. Meddle was considered by Nick Mason to be “the first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced the idea of a theme that can be returned to.” The album had the sound and style of the succeeding breakthrough-era Pink Floyd albums but stripped away the orchestra that was prominent in Atom Heart Mother. Meddle also included the atmospheric “One of These Days”, a concert favorite featuring Nick Mason’s menacing one-line vocal (“One of these days, I’m going to cut you into little pieces”), distorted and bluesy slide guitar, and a melody that at one point segues into a throbbing synthetic pulse quoting the theme tune of the cult classic science fiction television show Doctor Who. The mellow feeling of the next three albums is very present on “Fearless”, and this track displays a country influence, as does the prominent pedal steel guitar on “A Pillow of Winds”. The latter track is one of the Floyd’s very few acoustic love songs. Waters’s role as lead songwriter began to take form, with his jazzy “San Tropez” brought to the band practically completed. Meddle was greeted both by critics and fans enthusiastically, and Pink Floyd were rewarded with a #3 album chart peak in the UK; it only reached #70 in U.S. charts, partly because Capitol Records had not provided it with enough publicity support. Today, Meddle remains one of their most well-regarded efforts.

Obscured by Clouds was released in 1972 as the soundtrack to the film La Vallee, another art house film by Barbet Schroeder. This was the band’s first U.S. Top 50 album (where it hit #46), hitting at #6 in the UK. While Mason described the album years later as “sensational”, it is less well-regarded by critics. The lyrics of “Free Four”, the first Pink Floyd song to achieve significant airplay in the U.S., introduced Waters’s ruminations on his father’s death in World War II which would figure in subsequent albums. Two other songs on the album, “Wots…uh, the Deal” and “Childhood’s End”, also hint at themes used in later albums, the former focusing on loneliness and desperation which would come to full fruit in the Roger Waters-led era, and the latter hinting much at the next album, fixated on life, death and the passage of time. “Childhood’s End”, inspired by the Arthur C. Clarke book of the same name, was also Gilmour’s last lyrical contribution for 15 years. The album was, to an extent, stylistically different from the preceding Meddle, with the songs generally being shorter, often taking a somewhat pastoral approach compared to the atmospheric use of sound effects and keyboard on sections of Meddle, and sometimes even running into folk rock, blues rock and piano-driven soft rock (“Burning Bridges”, “The Gold It’s in the…” and “Stay” being the best respective examples for each).

The release of Pink Floyd’s massively successful 1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon, was a watershed moment in the band’s popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968’s “Point Me At The Sky” and was never a hit-single-driven group, but The Dark Side of the Moon featured a U.S. Top 20 single (“Money”). The album became the band’s first #1 on U.S. charts, a huge improvement over its previous recordings. The critically-acclaimed album stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for an unprecedented 741 weeks (including 591 consecutive weeks from 1976 to 1988), establishing a world record and making it one of the top-selling albums of all time. It also remained 301 weeks on UK charts, despite never rising higher than #2 there, and is highly praised by critics. Saxophone forms an important part of the album’s sound, exposing the band’s jazz influences, and female backing vocals play a key role in helping to diversify the album’s texture. For example, straight rock songs such as “Money” and “Time” are placed on either side of mellow pedal steel guitar sounds (reminiscent of Meddle) in “Breathe” and female vocal-laden song “The Great Gig in the Sky” (with Clare Torry on lead vocal), while minimalist instrumental “On the Run” is performed almost entirely on a single synthesizer. Incidental sound effects and snippets of interviews feature alongside the music, many of them taped in the studio. The album’s lyrics and sound attempt to describe the different pressures that everyday life places upon human beings. This concept (conceived by Waters in a band meeting around Mason’s kitchen table) proved a powerful catalyst for the band and together they drew up a list of themes, several of which would be revisited by Waters on later albums, such as “Us and Them“‘s musings on violence and the futility of war, and the themes of insanity and neurosis discussed in “Brain Damage”. The album’s complicated and precise sound engineering by Alan Parsons set new standards for sound fidelity; this trait became a recognizable aspect of the band’s sound and played a part in the lasting chart success of the album, as audiophiles constantly replaced their worn-out copies.

Seeking to capitalize on its newfound fame, the band also released a compilation album, A Nice Pair, which was a gatefold repackaging of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets. It was also during this period that director Adrian Maben released the first Pink Floyd concert film, Live at Pompeii. The original theatrical cut featured footage of the band performing in 1971 at an amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience present (only the film crew and stage staff). Fortuitously, Maben also happened to capture some interviews and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band during recording sessions for Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios, some of which were incorporated alongside other new footage between songs in later versions of Live at Pompeii.

Wish You Were Here, released in 1975, carries an abstract theme of absence: absence of any humanity within the music industry and, most poignantly, the absence of Syd Barrett. Well-known for its popular title track, the album includes the largely instrumental, nine-part song suite “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”, a tribute to Barrett in which the lyrics deal explicitly with the aftermath of his breakdown. Many of the musical influences in the band’s past were brought together — atmospheric keyboards, blues guitar pieces, extended saxophone solos (by Dick Parry), jazz fusion workouts and aggressive slide guitar — in the suite’s different linked parts, culminating in a funeral dirge played with synthesized horn. The remaining tracks on the album, “Welcome to the Machine” and “Have a Cigar”, harshly criticize the music industry; the latter is sung by British folk singer Roy Harper. It was the first Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and the U.S. charts, and critics praise it just as enthusiastically as Dark Side of the Moon. In a famous anecdote, a heavyset man with a completely shaved head and eyebrows wandered into the studio while the band was recording “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”. The band could not recognize him for some time, when suddenly one of them realized it was Syd Barrett. He was greeted enthusiastically by the band but subsequently slipped away during the impromptu party for David Gilmour’s wedding (which was, coincidentally, also on that day). It was the last time any of the other band members saw him. Gilmour recently confirmed this story, although he could not recall which song they were working on when Syd showed up. Barrett’s eyebrow-shaving tendencies would later be revisited in the movie Pink Floyd: The Wall.

During this era, Waters asserted more and more control over Pink Floyd’s output. Wright’s influence became largely inconsequential, and he was fired from the band during the recording of The Wall. Much of the music from this period is considered secondary to the lyrics, which explore Waters’s feelings about his father’s death in World War II and his increasingly cynical attitude towards political figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Mary Whitehouse. Although still finely nuanced, the music grew more guitar-based at the expense of keyboards and saxophone, both of which became (at best) part of the music’s background texture along with the obligatory sound effects. A full orchestra (even larger than the brass ensemble from Atom Heart Mother) plays a significant role on The Wall and especially The Final Cut.

By January 1977, and the release of Animals (UK #2, U.S. #3), the band’s music came under increasing criticism from some quarters in the new punk rock sphere as being too flabby and pretentious, having lost its way from the simplicity of early rock and roll. Animals was, however, considerably more basic-sounding than the previous albums, due to either the influence of the burgeoning punk-rock movement or the fact that the album was recorded at Pink Floyd’s new (and somewhat incomplete) Britannia Row Studios. The album was also the first to not have a single songwriting credit for Rick Wright. Animals again contained lengthy songs tied to a theme, this time taken in part from George Orwell’s Animal Farm, which used “Pigs”, “Dogs” and “Sheep” as metaphors for members of contemporary society. Despite the prominence of guitar, keyboards and synthesizers still play an important role on Animals, but the saxophone and female vocal work that defined much of the previous two albums’ sound is absent. The result is a more hard-rock effort overall, bookended by two parts of a quiet acoustic piece. Many critics did not respond well to the album, finding it “tedious” and “bleak”, although some celebrated it for almost those very reasons. For the cover artwork, a giant inflatable pig was commissioned to float between the chimney towers of London’s Battersea Power Station. However, the wind made the pig balloon difficult to control, and in the end it was necessary to matte a photo of the pig balloon onto the album cover. The pig nevertheless became one of the enduring symbols of Pink Floyd, and inflatable pigs were a staple of the band’s live shows from then on.

1979’s epic rock opera The Wall, conceived by Waters, dealt with the themes of loneliness and failed communication, which were expressed by the metaphor of a wall built between a rock artist and his audience. This album gave Pink Floyd renewed acclaim and another chart-topping single with “Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)”. The Wall also included the future concert staples “Comfortably Numb” and “Run Like Hell”, with the former in particular becoming a cornerstone of album-oriented rock and classic-rock radio playlists as well as one of the group’s best-known songs. The album was co-produced by Bob Ezrin, a friend of Waters who shared songwriting credits on “The Trial” and from whom the band later temporarily distanced themselves after quarreling with him over several contentious issues. Even more than during the Animals sessions, Waters was asserting his artistic influence and leadership over the band, which prompted increased conflicts with the other members. The music had become distinctly more hard-rock, although the large orchestrations on some tracks recalled an earlier period, and there are a few quieter songs interspersed throughout (such as “Goodbye Blue Sky” and “Nobody Home”). Wright’s influence was completely minimized, and he was fired from the band during recording, only returning on a fixed wage for the live shows in support of the album. Ironically, Wright was the only member of Pink Floyd to make any money from The Wall concerts, the rest covering the extensive cost overruns of their most spectacular concerts yet.

Despite never hitting #1 in the UK (it reached #3), The Wall spent 15 weeks atop the U.S. charts during 1980. Critics praised it, and it has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. It is the third-best selling album of all time in the U.S and the best selling album by a single artist to be released during the 1970s. It has been certified 23x platinum by the RIAA, for sales of 11.5 million copies in U.S. alone. The huge commercial success of The Wall made Pink Floyd the only artists since the The Beatles to have the best selling albums of two years (1973 and 1980) in less than a decade.

A film entitled Pink Floyd: The Wall was released in 1982, incorporating essentially all of the music from the album. The film, written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker, starred The Boomtown Rats founder Bob Geldof and featured striking animation by noted British artist and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe. It grossed over $14 million at the North American box office. A song which first appeared in the movie, “When the Tigers Broke Free”, was released as a single on a limited basis. This song was finally made widely available on the compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd and the re-release of The Final Cut. Also in the film is the song “What Shall We Do Now?”, which was cut out of the original album due to the time constraints of vinyl records. The only song from the album not used was “Hey You”, but a sequence was filmed using the song and it only exists as raw footage with poor visual quality but very good audio quality. It was released for the first time as a bonus with the extras section of the 1999 DVD release as a deleted scene.

1983 saw the release of The Final Cut, dedicated to Roger Waters’s father, Eric Fletcher Waters. Even darker in tone than The Wall, this album re-examined many previous themes, while also addressing then-current events, including Waters’s anger at Britain’s participation in the Falklands War, the blame for which he laid squarely at the feet of political leaders (“The Fletcher Memorial Home”). It concludes with a cynical and frightening glimpse at the possibility of nuclear war (“Two Suns in the Sunset”). Michael Kamen and Andy Bown contributed keyboard work in lieu of Richard Wright’s departure, which had not been formally announced before the album’s release. Though technically a Pink Floyd album, the LP’s front cover displayed no words, only the back cover reading: “The Final Cut - A requiem for the post war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd: Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason”. Roger Waters received the sole songwriting credit for the entire record, which became a prototype in sound and form for later Waters solo projects. Waters has since said that he offered to release the record as a solo album, but the rest of the band rejected this idea. However, in his book Inside Out, drummer Nick Mason says that no such discussions ever took place. Gilmour reportedly asked Waters to hold back the release of the album so that he could write enough material to contribute, but this request was refused. The music’s tone is largely similar to The Wall’s but somewhat quieter and softer, resembling songs like “Nobody Home” more than “Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)”. It is also more repetitive, with certain leitmotifs cropping up continually. Only moderately successful with fans by Floyd’s standards (UK #1, U.S. #6), but reasonably well-received by critics, the album yielded one minor radio hit, “Not Now John”, the only hard rock song on the album (and the only one partially sung by Gilmour). The arguments between Waters and Gilmour at this stage are rumored to be so bad that they were supposedly never seen in the recording studio simultaneously, and Gilmour’s co-producer credit was dropped from the album sleeve (though he received attendant royalties). There was no tour for the album, although parts of it were performed live by Waters on his subsequent solo jaunts.

After The Final Cut was released, the band members went their separate ways and spent time working on individual projects. Gilmour was the first to complete his solo album, releasing About Face in March 1984. Wright joined forces with Dave Harris of Fashion to form Zee, which released the experimental album Identity a month after Gilmour’s project. In May 1984, Waters released The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a concept album once proposed as a Pink Floyd project. A year after his band mates’ projects, Mason released the album Profiles, a collaboration with Rick Fenn of 10cc which featured guest appearances by Gilmour and UFO keyboardist Danny Peyronel.

Waters announced in December of 1985 that he was departing Pink Floyd, describing the band as “a spent force creatively”, but in 1986 Gilmour and Mason began recording a new Pink Floyd album. At the same time, Roger Waters was working on his second solo album, entitled Radio K.A.O.S.. A bitter legal dispute ensued with Waters claiming that the name “Pink Floyd” should have been put to rest, but Gilmour and Mason upheld their conviction that they had the legal right to continue as “Pink Floyd.” The suit was eventually settled out of court.

After considering and rejecting many other titles, the new album was released as A Momentary Lapse of Reason (UK #3, U.S. #3). Without Waters, who had been the band’s dominant songwriter for over a decade and a half, the band sought the help of outside writers. As Pink Floyd had never done this before (except for the orchestral contributions of Geesin and Ezrin), this move received much criticism. Ezrin, who had by now renewed his friendship with Gilmour, served as co-producer as well as being one of these writers. Rick Wright also returned, at first as a salaried employee during the final recording sessions, and then officially rejoining the band after the subsequent tour.

Gilmour later admitted that Mason had hardly played on the album. Because of Mason and Wright’s limited contributions, some critics say that A Momentary Lapse of Reason should really be regarded as a Gilmour solo effort, in much the same way that The Final Cut might be regarded as a Waters album.

A year later, the band released a double live album and a concert video taken from its 1988 Long Island shows, entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder, and later recorded some instrumentals for a classic-car racing film La Carrera Panamericana, set in Mexico and featuring Gilmour and Mason as participating drivers. During the race Gilmour and manager Steve O’Rourke (acting as his map-reader) crashed. O’Rourke suffered a broken leg, but Gilmour walked away with just some bruises. The instrumentals are notable for including the first Floyd material co-written by Wright since 1975, as well as the only Floyd material co-written by Mason since Dark Side of the Moon.

1992 saw the box set release of Shine On. The 9 disc set included re-releases of the studio albums A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. A bonus disc entitled The Pink Floyd Early Singles was also included. The set’s packaging featured a case allowing the albums to stand vertically together, with the side-by-side spines displaying an image of the Dark Side of the Moon cover. The circular text of each CD includes the almost illegible words “The Big Bong Theory”.

The band’s next recording was the 1994 release The Division Bell, which was much more of a group effort than Momentary Lapse had been, with Wright now reinstated as a full and contributing band member and figuring prominently in the writing credits. The album was received more favorably by critics and fans alike than Lapse had been, but was still heavily criticized as tired and formulaic. It was the second Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and U.S. charts. The Division Bell was another concept album, in some ways representing Gilmour’s take on the same themes Waters had tackled with The Wall. The title was suggested to Gilmour by his friend Douglas Adams. Many of the lyrics were co-written by Polly Samson, Gilmour’s girlfriend at the time, whom he married shortly after the album’s release. Besides Samson, the album featured most of the musicians who had joined the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, as well as saxophonist Dick Parry, a contributor to the mid-70s Floyd albums. Anthony Moore, who had co-written the lyrics for several songs on the previous album, penned the lyrics for a tune by Wright, “Wearing the Inside Out”, Wright’s first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd record since Dark Side of The Moon. Wright and Moore’s writing collaboration continued on nearly every song on Wright’s subsequent solo album, Broken China.

At the end of the tour in support of The Division Bell in1994, Gilmour stopped planning new music and tours for Pink Floyd, and the band went inactive.

The band released a live album entitled P*U*L*S*E in 1995. It hit #1 in U.S. and featured songs recorded during The Division Bell tour, primarily from concerts in London's Earls Court. The Division Bell concerts featured a mix of classic and modern Pink Floyd. The Pulse album has an entire performance of Dark Side of the Moon. VHS and Laserdisc versions of the concert at London's Earls Court 20 October 1994, were also released. A DVD edition was released on 10 July 2006 and quickly topped the charts. The original edition's CD case had an LED, timer IC, and battery which caused a red flash to blink once per second, like a heartbeat.

In 1995, the band received their first and only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for ""Marooned"".

On 17 January 1996, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman Billy Corgan. Roger Waters did not attend, still being antagonistic towards his former bandmates. At their acceptance speech, Gilmour - referring to the final verse of Dark Side of the Moon - said, ""I'll have to grab a couple more of these for our two band members that started playing different tunes; Roger and Syd..."". Although Mason was present to accept the award, he did not join Gilmour and Wright (and Billy Corgan) for their acoustic performance of 'Wish You Were Here'.

1996 saw the release of Richard Wright's second solo album, Broken China, where he collaborated again with lyricist Anthony Moore.

A live recording of The Wall was released in 2000, compiled from the 1980–1981 London concerts, entitled Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81. It reached #19 on the American album chart. In 2001, a remastered two-disc set of the band's best-known tracks entitled Echoes was released. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright all collaborated on the editing, sequencing, and song selection of the included tracks. Minor controversy was caused due to the songs seguing into one another non-chronologically, presenting the material out of the context of the original albums. Some of the tracks, such as ""Echoes"", ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"", ""Marooned"", and ""High Hopes"" have had substantial sections removed from them. The album reached #2 on the UK and U.S. charts.

In 2003, an SACD reissue of Dark Side of the Moon was released with new artwork on the front cover. The album was also re-released as an 180 gram, virgin vinyl pressing in 2003, which included all the original album art from the original release of the album, albeit with a new poster. Nick Mason's book, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd was published in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the U.S. Long-time Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited at his funeral and performed ""Fat Old Sun"" and ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" in Chichester Cathedral in tribute.

Two years later, on 2 July 2005, the band reunited for a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. This time, however, they were joined by Waters — the first time all four band members were on stage together in 24 years. The band performed a four-song set consisting of ""Speak To Me/Breathe (Breathe In The Air)"", ""Money"", ""Wish You Were Here"", and ""Comfortably Numb"", with both Gilmour and Waters sharing lead vocals. At the end of their performance Gilmour said ""thank you very much, good night"" and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous images of Live 8.

In the week after Live 8, there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd. According to record store chain HMV, sales of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd went up, in the following week, by 1343%, while Amazon.com reported increases in sales of The Wall at 3600%, Wish You Were Here at 2000%, The Dark Side of the Moon at 1400% and Animals at 1000%. David Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, and urged all the other artists and record companies profiting from Live 8 to do the same. On 16 November 2005 Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. Gilmour and Mason attended in person, explaining that Wright was in hospital following eye surgery, and Waters appeared on a video screen, from Rome.

David Gilmour released his third solo record, On an Island, on 6 March 2006, and began a tour of small concert venues in Europe, Canada and the U.S. with a band including Richard Wright and other musicians from the post-Waters Pink Floyd tours. Roger Waters was also invited to join the band (along with Nick Mason) in London, but final rehearsals for his 2006 Europe/U.S. tour required him to decline. Nonetheless, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason's encore performances of ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""Comfortably Numb"" marked the first performance by Pink Floyd since Live 8. Waters was joined on stage by Mason for a few performances of Dark Side of the Moon during his 2006 tour. Wright was also invited to join Waters for the first performance, but Wright refused on the grounds that he had to work on his solo album (which remains unreleased). Waters' worldwide The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour consisted of Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety along with a selection of other Pink Floyd material and a small number of songs from Waters' solo career, although no songs from The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking or Radio K.A.O.S. were included. Waters is reported to be working on a solo album, and there has been talk of him doing a Broadway musical version of The Wall, with other Pink Floyd music to be inserted.

Many fans expressed hope that the band's Live 8 appearance would lead to a reunion tour, and a record-breaking US$250 million deal for a world tour was offered, but the band made it clear that they had no such plans. In the weeks after the show, however, the rifts between the members seemed to have mostly healed. Gilmour confirmed that he and Waters are on ""pretty amicable terms"". Waters indicated that he would like to play together again not for a whole tour but for a single event, similar to Live 8.

On 31 January 2006, David Gilmour issued a joint statement on behalf of the group stating that they had no plans to reunite, refuting rumours from several media outlets. Gilmour later stated in an interview with La Repubblica that he is finished with Pink Floyd and wishes to focus on solo projects and his family. He mentions that he agreed to play Live 8 with Waters to support the cause, to make peace with Waters, and knowing he would regret not taking part. However, he states that Pink Floyd would be willing to perform for a concert ""that would support Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts"". Then speaking with Billboard, Gilmour changed his ""finished with Pink Floyd"" sentiment to ""who knows"".

2007 saw the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's signing to EMI and the 40th anniversary of the release of their first three singles ""Arnold Layne"", ""See Emily Play"" and ""Apples and Oranges"" and their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. This was marked by the release of a limited edition set containing mono and stereo mixes of the albums, plus tracks from the singles and other rare recordings.

On 10 May 2007, Roger Waters performed at the Syd Barrett tribute concert at the Barbican Centre in London. This was then followed by a surprise performance by the post-Waters Pink Floyd line-up of David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason of ""Arnold Layne"" to a rapturous applause and standing ovation. As it turned out, it would be the final time this configuration of Pink Floyd would ever perform together.

Hopes of a second reunion concert with the band's classic lineup were dashed when Waters did not perform with the group. Roger Waters took to the stage to screams of ""Pink Floyd!"" to which he responded, ""Later."" Gilmour, Mason, and Wright took to the stage for what would be the final time to screams of ""Roger Waters!"" to which Gilmour politely responded, ""Yeah, he was here too, now the rest of us.""

In a January 2007 interview, Waters suggested he had become more open to a Pink Floyd reunion: “I would have no problem if the rest of them wanted to get together. It wouldn’t even have to be to save the world. It could be just because it would be fun. And people would love it.”

On 25 September 2007, Gilmour stated that a future reunion of Pink Floyd in any form, be it with or without Roger Waters, looked grim, stating that ""I can’t see why I would want to be going back to that old thing. It’s very retrogressive. I want to look forward, and looking back isn’t my joy.""

In December 2007, Pink Floyd released a new CD box set, Oh, By the Way, containing all fourteen studio albums with their newest respective CD remasters, original vinyl artwork plus new artwork from Storm Thorgerson. Mason and Waters had said that they would be happy to do a Pink Floyd tour, but during the BBC1 Special, ""Which One's Pink?,"" when asked about whether the band would reform, Gilmour ambiguously stated either ""Ain't gonna happen"" or ""Anything could happen"". Which of these two phrases were said is debatable. During the same documentary, Wright stated that he ""wouldn't mind playing the Pink Floyd 'music' again,"" but said nothing solid about reuniting with the actual members.

In a May 2008 interview for BBC 6Music, David Gilmour hinted that he would be in favour of another one-off show, but ruled out a full tour: ""Who knows? Who knows the future? I haven't absolutely said 'no' to the possibility but I think that in reality any sort of long-term thing together is not going to happen. We did the one-off thing and that was probably enough for me but we shall see. At my incredibly advantaged age –having achieved this– I've earned the right to sit on my ass for a little while and consider what to do next."" In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to contemporary music. Roger Waters and Nick Mason were present at the ceremony, where they received the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.

Speaking to Associated Press to promote the release of his new live album, David Gilmour revealed that a reunion ""categorically"" won't happen. Gilmour said: ""The [Live 8] rehearsals were less enjoyable. The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that I've done that. I've been there, I've done it.""

On 15 September 2008, Richard Wright died at age 65. He was lauded by his surviving bandmates, Gilmour in particular, for his influence on the overall sound of Pink Floyd.

In April 2009, it was revealed that the band had initiated legal action against EMI, their label for over four decades, for allegedly failing to pay royalties. The dispute is reportedly connected to an ongoing disagreement with Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm who took ownership of EMI in 2007.

On 10 July 2010, Roger Waters and David Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event took place at Kidlington in Oxfordshire, England. The pair played to an audience of approximately 200. The event raised money for Palestinian children in order to give them a better life. Gilmour played this event in 2009, when he performed alongside Kate Moss. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour has agreed to perform ""Comfortably Numb"" at one of Waters' upcoming performances of The Wall.

On 12 October 2010, Gilmour released Metallic Spheres, a collaboration with techno group The Orb

In 2011, Roger Waters embarked on a tour of ""The Wall"". He confirmed that David Gilmour would perform guitar and vocals on ""Comfortably Numb"" at one of the performances. Gilmour appeared at the 12 May 2011 concert at the O2 Arena in London. Gilmour and Nick Mason joined Waters at the end of the show for a performance of ""Outside the Wall""

On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the band's back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including special ""Immersion"" multi-disc multi-format editions. All the albums have been remastered by James Guthrie, the co-producer of The Wall.

Maroon 5,"Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California, United States. The group was formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers while its members were still in high school and originally consisted of Adam Levine (lead vocals, guitar), Jesse Carmichael (guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums). Kara's Flowers signed to Reprise Records and released an album, ""The Fourth World"", in 1997. After a tepid response to the album, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. Dusick and Madden stayed local at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the east coast to attend Five Towns College. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.

In 2001, the band regrouped, with guitarist James Valentine added to the line-up, and pursued a new direction under the name: Maroon 5. At this point, Jesse Carmichael switched to playing the keyboards and this has become his main instrument in the band (although he also plays rhythm guitar to this day). After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with Octone Records and released their debut album, ""Songs About Jane"", in June 2002. The album's lead single ""Harder to Breathe"", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, the band toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's ""1.22.03.Acoustic"" and 2005's ""Live Friday the 13th"". In 2006, Ryan Dusick officially left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band recorded their second album, ""It Won't Be Soon Before Long"" and released it in May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, ""Makes Me Wonder"", became the band's first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100.

On September 21, 2010, the band released their third studio album entitled ""Hands All Over"". It was re-released in 2011 to include the single ""Moves like Jagger"" (featuring Christina Aguilera). While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, ""Moves like Jagger"" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band released their next album, ""Overexposed"", on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were really successful on the charts - for example, the second single from Overexposed, ""One More Night"" (released on June 19, 2012), reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, ""V"", with the very-first line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012. The album debuted at top of the weekly Billboard 200 chart. Since its debut in 2002, the band has sold more than 15 million albums in the United States and over 100 million singles and 27 million albums worldwide. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Adele," Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, (born 5 May 1988), is a Grammy Award-Winning English singer-songwriter from Enfield, North London. Her debut album, 19, was released in January 2008 and entered the UK album chart at #1. The album has since received four-times Platinum certification in the UK and has sold 5,500,000 copies worldwide. The album included the hugely popular song Chasing Pavements. 19 earned Adele two Grammy Awards in February 2009 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. 

Her second album, 21, was released on January 24th 2011 in the UK and propelled Adele to unprecedented mega-stardom. In just eleven months, 21 received fourteen-times Platinum certification in the UK for shipments in excess of 4,500,000 copies, and has sold a further 6,200,000 copies in the US denoting sextuple-Platinum status. As of January 2012, 21 has sold an estimated seventeen million copies worldwide. The album has produced three global chart-topping singles thus far: Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You, and Set Fire to the Rain. 21 won Adele six awards at the 2012 Grammy Awards, among them Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

Adele graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in May 2006, where she was classmates with Leona Lewis. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent. In school, she was more interested in going into A&R, and hoped to launch other people's careers. Four months later, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend who posted it on Myspace where it became very successful and led to a phone call from music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting. Nick Huggett at XL Recordings recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management and in June 2006 Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major attraction for Adele who was a big fan of the English singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL Recordings in September 2006.

Adele's breakthrough song, Hometown Glory, was released in October 2007. Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate's song, My Yvonne, from his debut album. Adele became the first recipient of the BRIT Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. She released her second single Chasing Pavements on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album, 19. Chasing Pavements reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks, finally remaining in the Top 40 14 weeks after its release. The album itself entered the British charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music would name 19 an ""essential"" Blue Eyed Soul recording.

In June 2013, Adele was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to music.

The much-anticipated third studio album ""25"" was released on November 20, 2015 on the label XL. The first single from the album, ""Hello"", was released on Friday, October 23, 2015.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Adele"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Green Day,"Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, drummer Tré Cool and guitarist and backing vocalist Jason White, who became a full member after playing in the band as a session and touring guitarist for 13 years. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992).

Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, Bad Religion, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States.

Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. 21st Century Breakdown was followed up by a trilogy of albums called ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! released in September, November and December 2012 respectively.

They are one of the world's best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 75 million albums and singles worldwide. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design, losing only the first. Also in 2010, Green Day were ranked number 91 in the VH1 list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"".

In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as ""Al Sobrante"". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band.

In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana.

Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tré Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S.

Kerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo ""was the only person we could really talk to and connect with"". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, ""I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward."" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.


Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994, Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs ""Longview"", ""Basket Case"", and ""When I Come Around"", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year.

In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled ""J.A.R."". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said ""In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets."" The singles released from Insomniac were ""Geek Stink Breath"", ""Stuck with Me"", ""Brain Stew/Jaded"", and ""Walking Contradiction"".

Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for ""Walking Contradiction"" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.

After a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second ""clip show"" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER.

The other singles released from Nimrod were ""Nice Guys Finish Last"", ""Hitchin' a Ride"" and ""Redundant"". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled ""The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg"", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 1999, the guitarist Jason White began supporting the band on the concerts as rhythm guitarist.

In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied. Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying ""Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying."" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying ""Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?"" Though it produced the hit ""Minority"" and a smaller hit with ""Warning"", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified platinum.

At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist.

The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including ""Espionage"", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys.

In the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands.

Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of ""I Fought the Law"" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII.



The resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, ""American Idiot"". The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious ""Jesus of Suburbia"". The album depicts the modern American life under the control from an idiot ruler who let people be misinformed by media as well as inserted ""redneck agenda"". It gives different angles on an everyman, modern icons, and leaders on the topic. Released two months before U.S. President George W. Bush was reelected, the album became protest art. American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005.

Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively.

On August 1, 2005 Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands.

On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band.

Green Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!! In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, California.

In an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.

21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.

Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, ""There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.""

In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot. American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled ""When It's Time"". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single ""When It's Time"".

During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography.

During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: ""We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get [the songs] down in some early form."" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song ""Cigarettes and Valentines"". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will ""most likely"" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011.

During the end of 2011, the band played several secret shows (under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs) whose setlists consisted almost entirely of previously unheard songs. Green Day entered the studio and began recording new material in February 2012, later announcing a trilogy of albums titled ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! which would be released in the fall of 2012. The trilogy marked longtime touring guitarist Jason White's induction as the fourth member of the band. That summer Green Day played several festivals and promotional shows including the Rock en Seine festival in France, the Rock am See festival in Germany, and the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom.

¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! were released on September 21, November 9, and December 7, 2012 respectively and were met with generally positive reviews. On January 22, 2013 the band announced that ¡Cuatro!, a documentary about the making of ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré!, would premiere on January 26 in Aspen, Colorado as part of the X Games FILM showcase, and would be released on DVD April 9, 2013. Another documentary was announced called Broadway Idiot which focuses on the creation on the American Idiot musical and Armstrong's run as playing the character of St. Jimmy. On March 10, 2013, Green Day began their 99 Revolutions Tour to support the trilogy. In June, Green Day broke Emirates Stadium attendance record with 60,000 tickets sold, in the United Kingdom. The band played Dookie from start to finish on several dates on their European leg, including during Reading Festival 2013 headline show.

Demolicious, a compilation that album contains alternate versions and demos of songs from ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré! recorded during the studio sessions of these albums, was released on April 19, 2014, for Record Store Day. It also contains a previously unreleased song called ""State of Shock"" and an acoustic version of ""Stay the Night"", from ¡Uno!.

Since 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons.

In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song ""The Saints Are Coming"", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the disaster.

In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil.

Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song ""Working Class Hero"", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 but lost to The White Stripes' ""Icky Thump"". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.

In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010.

The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show ""a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I’ve seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past."" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that ""the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated"".

Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be ""visually striking [and] musically adventurous"", but noted that ""the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development"". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's ""massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season"". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score ""is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative."" He concluded that ""American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers – for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway."" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote ""Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won’t know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits—it's a global knockout."" The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards.

In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that ""[Artists are] basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it."" For Billie Joe Armstrong, ""Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.""

On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce.

On January 23, 2013, it was announced that a documentary showing Armstrong's journey from punk rock to Broadway was to be released. Called Broadway Idiot and showing a lot of behind-the-scenes of the American Idiot musical production, the movie was directed by Doug Hamilton, veteran television journalist for CBS News' 60 Minutes and PBS documentaries such as Nova, Frontline and American Masters. A trailer was released on January 30, 2013. The documentary premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 15, 2013.

The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as ""true punk"". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented:

""So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.""

Armstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying ""Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money – we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'""

On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, lead vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong stopped while performing Basket Case, because he believed their time was being shortened, possibly in order to extend R&B artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled ""1 Minutes Left"", saying ""You're not gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!"". He also told the crowd he was not Justin Bieber and labeled the festival as a ""joke"". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on their behalf stating that ""Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas"" also adding that Armstrong will be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills for anxiety and insomnia. However Mike Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Billie Joe meant by his rant

Bruno Mars,"Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985 in Waikiki, Hawaii), better known by his stage name Bruno Mars, is a Filipino-Puerto Rican American singer-songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist signed to Atlantic Records. He is most well known for his hit Just The Way You Are, which went #1 in 9 countries in 2010. He is also known for singing/co-writing the hooks for the #1 hit Nothin' On You by B.o.B, and Billionaire by Travie McCoy; he also co-wrote the international hits Right Round by Flo Rida and Wavin' Flag by K'naan.

After the success of the songs he featured on, Mars released his debut EP, It’s Better If You Don’t Understand, in May 2010. 

He then released his debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, on October 5th, which features special guest appearances from B.o.B, Cee-Lo Green, and Damian Marley.  The lead single, Just the Way You Are, was released on July 19, 2010.  The second single off the album, Grenade, was released on September 2010 as a promotional single but was eventually shifted to official second single. The It Will Rain Songfacts reports that in 2011 he recorded ""It Will Rain,"" the lead single from the soundtrack to the movie The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1. It was released exclusively on iTunes September 27, 2011.

Bruno Mars was born and raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii by parents Pete and Bernadette ""Bernie"" Hernandez, of Puerto Rican and Filipino descent. Hernandez was one of six children and came from a musical family giving him a diverse mix of reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&B. From a young age, he was impersonating and performing songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations. In 1990, Hernandez was featured in MidWeek as ""Little Elvis"", going on to have a cameo in Honeymoon in Vegas in 1992. ""I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I'm a fan,"" he stated.

In 2010 he said, ""Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments. My uncle's an incredible guitar player, my dad's an incredible percussionist, my brother's a great drummer, he actually plays in our band. I've just been surrounded by it."" He attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School, graduating in 2003 at the age of seventeen, and shortly after moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career.

Before becoming a successful solo artist, Hernandez was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, and Sean Kingston, as well as Flo Rida's international hit ""Right Round"". He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song ""Get Sexy"" and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7. His first musical appearance as a singer was in Far East Movement's second studio album Animal, featured on the track ""3D"". He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on and co-writing B.o.B's ""Nothin' on You"" and Travie McCoy's ""Billionaire""; both songs peaked within the top ten of many charts worldwide. He said of them, ""I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of ""Nothin' on You"", it might've sounded like some '90s R&B."" Following this success, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You Don't Understand, on May 11, 2010. The EP peaked at the ninety-ninth position on the Billboard 200 and produced one single: ""The Other Side"", featuring rappers Cee Lo Green and B.o.B. He performed a medley of ""Nothin' on You"" and ""Airplanes"" with B.o.B and Hayley Williams at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.

He opened for Maroon 5 on the fall leg of the Hands All Over Tour which began on October 6, 2010. Mars also co-headlined with Travie McCoy on a European tour that started on October 18, 2010.

On September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas for possession of cocaine. He claims ""he has never used drugs before"" and his decision was ""foolish"".

He has been nominated for seven 2011 Grammy Awards. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Mars"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Nirvana,"There are several artists named 'Nirvana';

1) Nirvana was an American grunge band. The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and it was part of the Seattle grunge scene of the late 80s, alongside bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. As their popularity rose, alternative rock became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television during the early-to-mid '90s.

In late 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard (1987–1988).The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape.  After losing contact with Burckhard, the pair instead practised with Dale Crover of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988. Their first single, a cover version of ""Love Buzz"", a song by Dutch group 'Shocking Blue', was released in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. Their debut album, 'Bleach', was produced by Jack Endino and released in June 1989. Later that year, the band recorded the 'Blew EP' with producer Steve Fisk.

At the start of the new decade, the band commenced their first recording sessions to the follow-up album with producer Butch Vig, substituted their drummer by Dave Grohl and signed to DGC Records. The result, 'Nevermind', would eventually sell over seven million copies in the United States, and over 30 million worldwide.

In early 1993, Nirvana released ""Puss""/""Oh, the Guilt"", a split single with The Jesus Lizard, on the independent label Touch & Go. Meanwhile, the group chose Steve Albini as the producer to record its third album. 'In Utero' debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart in September the same year. 

As Nirvana's frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the ""spokesman of a generation"", with Nirvana the ""flagship band"" of ""Generation X"", their third studio album 'In Utero' was considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While Nirvana's mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band's dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the Meat Puppets, a band that Cobain had always idolised, performing with them the songs Oh, Me, Plateau and Lake of Fire. It was later released and topped the charts in 1994.

Nirvana's brief run ended with the suicide of Cobain in 1994, but the band's popularity expanded in the years that followed. Eight years after Cobain's death, ""You Know You're Right"", an unfinished demo that the band recorded two months prior to Cobain's death, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold more than fifty million albums worldwide, including more than ten million copies of Nevermind in the US alone. Nirvana remains a consistent presence on radio stations worldwide.

In 2004, the box set ""With the Lights Out"", a collection of radio sessions, home demos, studio demos and outtakes, was released. A year later, ""Sliver: The Best Of The Box"" was released, a compilation of selected ""WTLO"" tracks, but with 3 new tracks including a track from the famous ""Fecal Matter"" demo.

Band members: Kurt Cobain - vocals, guitar (1987–1994), Krist Novoselic - bass (1987–1994) Dave Grohl - drums, vocals (1990–1994)

Prior members:Aaron Burckhard - drums (1987–1988), Dale Crover - drums (1988, 1990),  Dave Foster - drums (1988), Chad Channing - drums (1988–1990), Jason Everman - guitar (1989), Dan Peters - drums (1990)

Touring members: Pat Smear - guitar (1993–1994), Lori Goldston - cello (1993–1994), Melora Creager - cello (1994)

2) Nirvana is a UK-based progressive rock band formed in 1967, primarily active in the late 1960s and early 1970s - and still sporadically active to the present day.

The band was formed in the summer of 1967 in an era when melodic pop/rock music with baroque and chamber arrangements and instrumentation was highly-prized. The band, consisted of two songwriter/performers - Greek-born Alex Spyropoulos and Irish-born Patrick Campbell-Lyons who met in London. They produced a number of singles (notably ""Rainbow Chaser"", ""Pentecost Hotel"", and ""Tiny Goddess"") for the fledgling Island Records label.

The band was signed by Island Records' founder Chris Blackwell in the era when he also signed the bands Traffic and Free. 

In October 1967 the band released its first album - a concept album produced by Blackwell titled The Story of Simon Simopath. The album was probably the first narrative concept album ever released - predating story-driven concept albums such as The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow (December 1968), The Who's Tommy (April 1969) and The Kinks' Arthur (September 1969).

Musically, the group blended myriad musical styles including rock, pop, folk, jazz, Latin rhythms and classical music - primarily augmented by baroque chamber-style arrangements to create a unique entity.

The next year 1968 their follow-up album, All Of Us, featured a similar broad range of musical styles. Their third album To Markos III was released on the Pye label in 1969.

In 1971 the duo amicably separated for a while, with Campbell-Lyons the primary contributor to the next two Nirvana albums, Local Anaesthetic 1971, and Songs Of Love And Praise 1972. Campbell-Lyons subsequently worked as a solo artist and issued further albums: Me And My Friend 1973, Electric Plough 1981, and The Hero I Might Have Been 1983 though these did not enjoy commercial success.

The band reunited in 1985, successfully touring Europe and releasing a compilation album Black Flower 1987 containing some new material. (Black Flower had been the provisional title of their third album.) In the 1990s two further albums were released. Secret Theatre 1994 compiled rare tracks and demos, while Orange And Blue 1996 contained previously unreleased material including a tongue-in-cheek cover of the song ""Lithium"" originally recorded by the American grunge band Nirvana who released its first album in 1989, and who the band had successfully sued over use of the name Nirvana. The undisclosed terms of the settlement has apparently allowed the original Nirvana to continue using its name and issuing new recordings.

In 1999 the band released a three-disc CD anthology titled ""Chemistry"" including several previously-unreleased tracks and some new material.

Top musicians who played on Nirvana sessions include: Lesley Duncan, Herbie Flowers, Billy Bremner (later of Rockpile/Dave Edmunds fame), Luther Grosvenor, Wynder K. Frogg, Clem Cattini and the full lineup of rock band Spooky Tooth.

The group was in the school of baroque-flavored, melodic pop-rock music typified by The Beatles of ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Revolver"", The Beach Boys of Pet Sounds and God Only Knows, the Zombies of Odessey and Oracle and Time Of The Season, the Procol Harum of A Whiter Shade Of Pale, the Moody Blues of Days of Future Passed and Nights In White Satin and The Kinks of Waterloo Sunset. The majority of the tracks on Nirvana's albums fall into that broad genre of contemporary popular music - not easily categorized - but perhaps best described as the baroque or chamber strand of ""progressive rock, soft rock or ""orchestral pop"".

Their first three albums were reissued on CD by Universal in 2003 and received critical acclaim. In 2005 Universal (Japan) reissued Local Anaesthetic and Songs Of Love And Praise.

As of late 2005 the founding members Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons are still sporadically writing and recording.

Metallica,"Metallica is an American metal band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, California, United States when drummer Lars Ulrich posted an advertisement in The Recycler. Metallica’s line-up originally consisted of Ulrich, rhythm guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield, and lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. Mustaine was later fired due to problems with alcoholism and drug addiction - he went on to form the band Megadeth. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett took his place. Metallica has been through several bassists, including Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus crash while the band was on tour), and Jason Newsted. The current bassist is Robert Trujillo, who joined in 2003.

Metallica’s early releases included fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship that placed them as one of the “big four” of the thrash metal sub-genre alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim, with the 1986 release Master of Puppets described as one of the most influential and “heavy” metal albums. The band achieved substantial commercial success with Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience.

In 2000, Metallica was among several artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band’s copyright-protected material for free without the band members’ consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the “steel-sounding” snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording process of St. Anger.

Metallica has released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, twenty-two music videos, and forty-four singles. The band has won nine Grammy Awards, and has had five consecutive albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200, making Metallica the only band ever to do so. The band’s 1991 album, Metallica, has sold over 15 million copies in the United States, and 22 million copies worldwide, which makes it the 25th-highest-selling album in the country. The band has sold an estimated 100 million records worldwide as of the release of their latest album Death Magnetic. As of September 2008, Metallica is the fourth highest-selling music artist since the SoundScan era began tracking sales on May 25, 1991, selling a total of 51,136,000 albums in the United States alone.

Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. Metallica organised a brand new festival. They called it Sonishpere. Several cities in Europe were chosen by the band.

On June 15, 2011, Metallica announced that recording sessions with singer-songwriter Lou Reed had concluded. The album, titled Lulu, was recorded over several months, and resulted in ten songs based on Frank Wedekind's ""Lulu"" plays, Earth Spirit and Pandora's Box. The album was released on October 31, 2011. The recording of the album was problematic at times, with Lars Ulrich later stating Lou Reed challenged him to a ""street fight"". On October 16, 2011, Robert Trujillo confirmed that the band was back in the studio and writing new material, stating, ""The writing process for the new Metallica album has begun. We've been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we're going to be recording during the most of next year.""

Daft Punk,"Daft Punk  is a multi Grammy Award-winning electronic music duo formed in 1994 in Paris, France, and consisting of French musicians Thomas Bangalter (born 3 January 1975) and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (born 8 February 1974). The band is considered one of the most successful electronic music collaborations of all time, both in album sales and in critical acclaim. 

Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 90s house movement in France, along with other artists such as Air, Cassius, and Dimitri From Paris. Daft Punk are credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the French house scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.

The group released four studio albums: Homework (1997), Discovery (2001), Human After All (2005), and Random Access Memories (2013). They also released the soundtrack album TRON: Legacy (2010); the live albums Alive 1997 (2002), Alive 2007 (2007); the compilation Musique Vol. 1 1993–2005 (2006); the remix albums Daft Club (2003), Human After All: Remixes (2006), TRON: Legacy Reconfigured (2011).


Early years (1987–1993)

Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in 1987 on the grounds of the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. 

Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that ""The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it."" A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music ""a bunch of daft punk."" Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found it to be amusing. As the latter stated, ""We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly."" Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.


Homework era (1993–1999)

In 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, ""The New Wave"", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of ""The New Wave"" called ""Alive"".

Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record ""Da Funk"". It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of ""Da Funk"", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax.

""Da Funk"" and ""Alive"" were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno, house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. ""Da Funk"" was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. It was during this period of change in dance music that Daft Punk became largely successful. They combined the aforementioned music styles and elements of rave that were crowd pleasers. The most successful single from Homework was ""Around the World"", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title.

Daft Punk also produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T. - A Story about Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.


Discovery era (1999–2004)

By 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier. 2001's Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album.

It reached #2 in the United Kingdom, and its single ""One More Time"" was a major club hit, creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles ""Digital Love"" and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart, and ""Face to Face"" hit #1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997.

2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.


Human After All era (2004–present)

Starting on September 13 and ending November 9, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were ""Robot Rock"", ""Technologic"", ""Human After All"" and ""The Prime Time of Your Life"". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was ""we believe that Human After All speaks for itself.""

A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on 4 April 2006. It contains new music videos for ""The Prime Time of Your Life"" and ""Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)"". Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes. A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots.

On 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007.

Daft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on 19 November 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed by Olivier Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island. In 2007 Daft Punk also debuted in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine in position 71.

Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles.


Influences

Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Years before producing electronic music as a duo, they were stated to have shared tastes for Elton John, MC5, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and The Stooges. Their mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own independent project, Darlin'. Bangalter expressed that ""It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band.""They drew inspiration from the rock and acid house displayed in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo pointed to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as an influential work, as the record ""put everything together"" in terms of genre.

The liner notes of Homework pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contains a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter expressed that ""In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty - it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too."" When questioned on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, ""before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people."" The Daft Punk track ""Teachers"" on Homework refers to several influences including Romanthony and Todd Edwards. De Homem-Christo stated that ""Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions — the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul — is part of how we sound today.""

Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk in tracks for Discovery. For the album Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single ""Windowlicker"", which was ""neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track"" according to Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of a previous artist. As stated by de Homem-Christo, ""On 'Digital Love' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge,"" which was generated through an in-studio Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, de Homem-Christo clarified that ""we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs.""


Visual components

Daft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured memorable characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555.

Their outward personae have also changed over time. During their Homework years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance. When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Very few photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes.

In their more visible Discovery years, they have appeared as futuristic robots for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. These suits, engineered by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., sport complicated helmets capable of various LED effects and metallic finger gloves. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers through an advertisement for a special presentation of their videos during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Thomas Bangalter once stated, ""We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 a.m. on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots.""

During a video interview shot in Japan, Daft Punk stated that they donned their robot masks to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later admitted that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. ""But then it became exciting from the audiences' point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower."" When asked on whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated ""No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you."" With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of dark leather jumpsuits and simplified versions of the Discovery head gear. The jumpsuits were designed by Hedi Slimane.

During the filming and promotion of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview.

It is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises has added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter stated, ""The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as long as I have, I am used to it.""


Live performances

In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States. In particular, a rare bootlegged video featuring the duo in Wisconsin matches the verified identity of Thomas Bangalter. Less clearly seen, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo is to Bangalter's right and is mostly cut off from the camera. Comparing the artwork packaging of Homework to the video footage, one can verify that the album's liner note photo was taken during this event.

In the fall of 1997 they did their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage instead of creating a more conventional DJ set. As Bangalter stated, ""Everything was synched up — the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to."" 25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk. Also of note is the November 8 performance in Birmingham, UK, from which came the recording of Alive 1997.

At the start of 2006, Daft Punk announced plans for a number of special summer shows. On 29 April Daft Punk performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival where they received a jubilant reception for their first U.S. performance since 1997. Thomas Bangalter had initially been reported as saying that there would be a DVD of their recent live set. He later emphasized his reluctance for such a release, as the duo felt that online amateur videos of their performances were more compelling than anything captured professionally. In an interview with the Miami Herald Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo stated that their November 11 appearance at the Bang Music Festival was their final for 2006 and that Daft Punk would conduct more performances in the future. The band later specified a date for a live show at Bercy, Paris for June 2007. Also reported were dates at the Rock Ness Festival and Wireless Festival in June, the Oxegen festival in July and Lollapalooza in August. Daft Punk then announced a world tour called Alive 2007.

Daft Punk played at the Rock Ness Festival by the banks of Loch Ness, Scotland on 10 June 2007 as the headline act in the 10,000 capacity Clash tent. To the crowds displeasure, the show was delayed, but the crowd gave the duo a jubilant welcome when they appeared. Due to popularity, part of the tent was removed to allow thousands of people outside to see the show. On 16 June 2007 Daft Punk successfully headlined the third day of the O2 Wireless Festival to positive reaction and reviews. The Times described the set as a ""memorable sensory spectacle, both dazzling and deafening"" and ThisisLondon declared it ""an almost faultless set of relentless electro euphoria"".

Daft Punk headlined Stage 2/NME Stage at the Oxegen music festival on 8 July 2007. Their live set was preceded by a showing of the trailer for the film Daft Punk's Electroma. Subsequent reports stated that the Daft Punk appearance was the highlight of the festival. NME expressed that the performance was ""a robotic spectacular"", while Shoutmouth described the set as ""typically triumphant"". Four days later, the duo played at Traffic Torino Free Festival in Parco della Pellerina in Turin, Italy.

Daft Punk headlined the AT&T stage on 3 August 2007, the first night of the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago. Their show there was praised by Pitchfork Media stating that the experience of watching the performance ""was a much-needed reminder of the still-potent power of communicative pop."" On August 9 they performed at KeySpan Park in Brooklyn, New York.

Daft Punk composed the music for the Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2008 Womenswear Full Show on 7 October 2007. The duo also headlined the Vegoose festival in Las Vegas on 27 October. They appeared at the festival along with bands Rage Against the Machine, Muse and Queens of the Stone Age. At the end of the month, Daft Punk performed in Mexico City. The duo also performed on Friday November 2, 2007 at the Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.

Modular announced that Daft Punk would appear in Australia for an event in December 2007 called Never Ever Land. The announcement addressed years of speculation on whether Daft Punk would visit Australia for live performances. Never Ever Land included Australian acts The Presets, Cut Copy, Muscles, Van She and the Bang Gang Deejays. Daft Punk were supported by their regular acts SebastiAn and Kavinsky at the appearances, which had been announced as an extension to the Alive 2007 tour. Never Ever Land toured to Melbourne at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Perth at the Esplanade, Brisbane at the Riverstage and finally Sydney at the Sydney Showground Main Arena. A Triple J interview with Pedro Winter (Busy P) revealed that Daft Punk's Sydney appearance on December 22 would be their final show for 2007 and the last to feature the pyramid light scheme. Tickets for the Australian tour sold more quickly than for any Daft Punk-related event in their history. The duo stated in an EMI-sponsored live webchat that there will be no tour performances for 2008, and that they would instead focus on new projects.

Daft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008. The duo appeared with Kanye West to perform a reworked version of ""Stronger"" on stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. For the appearance, Daft Punk utilized four JazzMutant Lemur controllers. A press release specified that this was the first televised live performance by the duo in their career. Bangalter's wife, Élodie Bouchez, also attended the event.

Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. In 2008, Daft Punk placed 38th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after debuting at position 71 in the year before. On 8 February 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"".


Daft Punk in DJ Hero
Daft Punk provided eleven new mixes featuring their music for the video game DJ Hero. They also appear in the game as playable characters, along with their own venue. The duo appear wearing their Discovery-era helmets and Human After All-era leather attire. Daft Punk's playable likenesses are absent from the sequel DJ Hero 2, which includes a remixed version of their song ""Human After All"".

At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the duo composed 24 tracks for the film Tron: Legacy. Daft Punk's score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. The band collaborated with him for two years on the score, from pre-production to completion. The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London. Joseph Kosinski, director of the film, referred to the score as being a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements.

Daft Punk also make a cameo appearance as disc jockey programs wearing their trademark robot masks within the film's virtual world. Tron: Legacy co-star Olivia Wilde stated that the duo may be involved with future promotional events related to the film. A teaser trailer features Daft Punk and their track ""Derezzed"" from Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack album of the film was released on 6 December 2010. A deluxe 2-disc edition of the album was also released that includes a poster of the duo from the film. Additional bonus tracks are also available through various online vendors. An official music video for ""Derezzed"", with a running time of less than two minutes, also premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released. The video, which features Olivia Wilde as Quorra in specially shot footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn's Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album of the score titled Tron: Legacy Reconfigured on 5 April 2011.

In 2010 Daft Punk were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight). Soma Records released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track called ""Drive"" that was made during the same time the duo was still with Soma Records and recording ""Rollin' and Scratchin'"" and ""Da Funk"". The track was included in a 20th anniversary multi-artist compilation of the Soma label. In October 2011, Daft Punk placed 28th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after appearing at position 44 in the year before. On 19 January 2012, Daft Punk ranked No. 2 on Mixmag's Greatest Dance Acts of All Time, with The Prodigy at No. 1 by just a few points.

In October 2012, Daft Punk provided a fifteen-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane's Yves Saint Laurent fashion show.[40] The duo also placed 44th in DJ Magazine's annual Top 100 DJs list.

Daft Punk is currently working on their forthcoming album in collaboration with singer-songwriter Paul Williams and Chic frontman Nile Rodgers. Williams mentioned the collaboration in two separate interviews, and that the project has been in production since 2010. During an interview with Rodgers, he stated that he would meet with Daft Punk to discuss the duo's upcoming album. Rodgers later said that he and Daft Punk had an informal jam session when they met, and that a formal collaboration would be undertaken. Although Williams stated that Daft Punk's new album could be released as early as June 2012, it was later confirmed that this would not be the case.

In May 2012 it was announced that Giorgio Moroder had collaborated with the duo, recording a monologue about his life in a vocal booth containing microphones ranging from the 1960s to present day. When asked, the engineer responded that each mic was used to represent the different decades of Moroder's life in his monologue. Rodgers was also present during the recording session. Chilly Gonzales stated in an interview that he had performed material for the duo's project in a one-day session: ""I played for hours and they’re gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever."" He also said that the album would be released ""next spring"".

In an interview conducted on 28 November 2012 with Fourplay member Nathan East, he said to have collaborated with the duo on the project. In this interview, it is also implied that the album will be available in CD format. On 4 January 2013, Nile Rodgers talked about his number of collaborations to be released in 2013 on his blog, and also stated ""The next time [he sets] foot in Japan, [his] collaboration with Daft Punk would have started to hit people's eardrums"".

Lana Del Rey,"Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Grant (born 21 June 1986), better known as Lana Del Rey, is a singer-songwriter from Lake Placid, New York, United States.  Del Rey is known for embellishing her songs and music videos with an eerily nostalgic vibe heavy on Americana themes, including images of surfing, Coney Island, Frank Sinatra, and Marilyn Monroe.  She has also listed a large number of her artistic influences, including Allen Ginsberg, Elvis Presley, Britney Spears, Nina Simone, Nirvana, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys, Antony and the Johnsons, actor and filmmaker John Waters, artists Mark Ryden and Marilyn Minter, and photographers Juergen Teller and Philip-Lorca diCorcia.

Grant released her first professionally produced body of work in 2010, an EP entitled Kill Kill, as Lizzy Grant via Five Points Records with producer David Kahne.  It was available for purchase on iTunes for a brief period before being withdrawn for unknown reasons.  Soon after, Del Rey released a self-titled collection of songs, Lana Del Rey, for electronic download.

In June 2011, Del Rey was signed with Stranger Records and issued the “Video Games” single, and in October 2011 she signed with Interscope Records.  Her next album, Born to Die, is set to be released worldwide on 31 January 2012 under Interscope.  The second single and title track, ""Born to Die,"" is set for release on 22 January 2012. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Muse,"Muse are an alternative rock band from Teignmouth, England, United Kingdom. The band consists of Matthew Bellamy on lead vocals, piano, keyboard and guitar, Chris Wolstenholme on backing vocals and bass guitar, and Dominic Howard on drums and percussion.  

They have been friends since their formation in early 1994 and changed band names a number of times (such as Gothic Plague, Fixed Penalty, and Rocket Baby Dolls) before adopting the name Muse. Since the release of their fourth album, Morgan Nicholls has also appeared with the band at live performances to provide keyboards, samples/synth, and backing vocals.

Their sound is a blend of alternative rock, classical music, electronica, metal, spanish guitars, and progressive rock. Usually they use the bass line as the driving force, often with the guitar providing only an extra layer to the song rather than carrying the melody, the bass has distortion and other effects applied to it to achieve a greater weight, allowing the guitar to digress from the main tune and play higher notes. Another peculiarity is Muse´s piano style in many of their songs; their music has been inspired by the works of Romantic pianist-composers such as Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky and Liszt, and has thus resulted in a fusion of Romantic style with modern rock.

The band are known for their energetic live performances and front man Matthew Bellamy's eccentric and avid interests in global conspiracy, extraterrestrial life, theology and the apocalypse (as much as in Space and theoretical physics). Their lyrical themes involve madcap conspiracy theory, revolutionary rabble-rousing, weird stuff about aliens (or Zetas, if you please), religions and other such classic Muse concerns. In general their music and lyrics gaze on helplessly at the subjugation of humanity by corrupt world leaders and encroaching environmental or galactic disasters (and certainly their fourth album 'Black Holes And Revelations' has its fair share of climate change/oil crisis/global inflagration paranoia). 

In October 1999, Muse released their first full length LP; 'Showbiz'. The album received mixed reviews among critics, and music fans, labeling the band as 'Radiohead copycats'. This, however, did not stop the album from selling over 700,000 copies, with success coming from singles; Unintended and Muscle Museum. The album also earned Muse a nomination at the 2000 BRIT Awards, for Best New Act.

2001, with John Leckie behind the desk again, saw the release of Origin of Symmetry along with Top 20 entries for Plug in Baby and New Born. The album went unreleased in the United States until 2005 because their record label at the time, Madonna's Maverick, allegedly thought the falsetto vocals would discourage radio play and wanted the band to re-record alternate vocals.  The band refused, and terminated its contract with Maverick.

Muse followed up with a b-side/live CD/DVD named Hullabaloo Soundtrack, showcasing the band's concert from France in late 2001. To promote the album, Muse also released the Dead Star/In Your World EP, which charted high in the UK charts and proving Muse could also write ""radio-friendly"" rock tunes, as well as the 7 minute long epics on Origin of Symmetry. Muse polished off their impressive year by winning Best Live Band at the 2002 Kerrang! Awards.

In 2003, Muse asked Rich Costey to step behind the desk to help create Absolution. The album had very strong sales all over the world, and helped the band achieve their first UK number 1 album. Its release was preceded by a download-only single and online video for the song Stockholm Syndrome. Followed by the singles Time is Running Out and Hysteria, which charted well in the UK charts and helped Muse secure a headline spot at the 2004 Glastonbury Festival.

Glastonbury saw Muse storm troop onto the high table of classic Glastonbury headline acts and prove themselves a formidable force in British rock.  Although many had their doubts at putting Muse on the bill with names such as Paul McCartney, Muse proved them all wrong and played what Bellamy described as ""the best gig of our lives."" It was only with that triumph fresh in their throats, they claim, that they realised they'd 'made it'.  However tragedy struck just shortly after Muse came off stage when Dom Howard's father (a big Muse fan) collapsed after witnessing his son play and died on the site.

Later that year, Muse toured the US, promoting Absolution, before returning home to play two sell-out gigs at London's Earls Court at the end of the year.

In 2006 and after a long and exhaustive tour, the band returned to the studio, and released Black Holes and Revelations.Interview with Dominic 2006

With the LP, the band secured their second UK album chart number one, whilst reaching the top spot in several other countries, as well as a Top 10 in the US billboard chart. The controversial single Supermassive Black Hole became Muse's highest UK entry in the charts, reaching number four, and also scored high entries in other countries. The album's second single, Starlight, reached number 13 in the UK charts in September 2006. The 3rd UK single was fan-favourite Knights of Cydonia, released on November 27th, and it reached number 10 in the UK charts. The 4th single from Black Holes & Revelations was Invincible, and was released April 15th 2007. It entered the UK singles chart at 21st place, and was the first single from the new album not to enter in the Top 20. On November 2, 2006, the band won an award for Best Alternative Act at the annual MTV EMA in Copenhagen. Muse were also named 'Best Live Act' at the Brit Awards in 2006 and have retained the title in 2007.

Two of the album's singles reached the highest US Modern Rock chart positions in the band's career during 2007: Starlight reached #2 in February 2007, and the all-falsetto Supermassive Black Hole reached #6 in October.  2007 also saw the band play to sellouts at Madison Square Garden and the Forum in Los Angeles, as well as headlining Austin City Limits Festival and Lollapalooza.

Even when the band says they do not see themselves as a massive stadium band, their headline concert on June 16th 2007, at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, sold out in 45 minutes six months before the gig and the band had to add a second show on June 17, where they proved to be more than worthy of stadium gigs.  The Wembley gigs became two of the biggest hyped concerts of 2007.  Already the gigs have been compared by music journalists to Live Aid and Queen gigs, also performed on the ""Hallowed Ground.""  The band's next release, HAARP: Live from Wembley, is expected to be made up of footage from the June 17th show.

In July 2007, Bellamy confirmed that he had begun to work on a new studio album and new songs, some more in line with electronic or ""dance"" music and others more with classical or symphonic music. 

In January 2008 the song ""Knights of Cydonia"" was voted number 1 on the Triple J Hottest 100, Australia's biggest annual alternative music countdown.

In 2009, the band released The Resistance, which contained the successful single ""Uprising"", the band's first Top 40 pop hit in the United States (achieving this with very little radio airplay) and their first #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart. Followup singles ""Resistance"" and ""Undisclosed Desires"" also proved successful. 

The band's sixth album, The 2nd Law, was released on 1 October 2012. The album's first single, ""Survival"", is the official song of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The second single, ""Madness"" was released on 20 August 2012. The third single, ""Follow Me"" was released on 7 December 2012, with an accompanying lyrics video released on the band's YouTube channel on 1 November 2012. The album has recieved generally positive reviews, with Allmusic noting ""their excursions into dubstep and dance music on tracks like ""Madness"" and ""Follow Me"" feel more like remixes than original songs.""

Their latest album Drones was released on June 5 2015 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Muse"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
Bob Dylan,"Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, United States) is an American musician, poet and artist whose position in popular culture is unique.

Dylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962. 

Much of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by Joan Baez. Some of his songs, such as ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with Joan Baez and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the and civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.

His album Bringing It All Back Home marked a move away from the folk scene and a move towards rock and roll and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. Bringing It All Back Home was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.

The second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song ""Like a Rolling Stone"", released in July of 1965, later being named ""The Greatest Song of All Time"" by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan's backing band The Hawks (who would later call themselves simply The Band). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work. On returning to New York he crashed his motorbike, sustaining serious injuries in the process, and went into a period of withdrawal while he recuperated. During the late 1960s, Dylan again changed stylistic tradition, moving away from the psychedelic culture of the time. It was then that he recorded The Times They Are A-Changin', perhaps more famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix.

The 1970s were a period during which Dylan was more sporadic in his output, releasing some poorly received LPs. He rarely appeared in person until 1973, when he began touring again with his backing band The Band. He also wrote one of his most extensively covered songs, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, as well as what is now recognised as one of his best albums Blood On The Tracks. Towards the end of the 1970s, Dylan discovered God, and released some albums of gospel music. He started to talk to the crowd about his faith during his performances, and wouldn't play any of his early work, which alienated some of his previous fans.

Dylan today still remains an influential and popular artist; despite a period of little note between 1970-2000, his 2006 album Modern Times reached the US chart at #1, as did his 2009 album Together Through Life, in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. His 2012 album Tempest was also critically acclaimed. Since 1988, Dylan has been on the so-called Never Ending Tour, during which his performanes have provoked controversy, with some critics claiming that his lyrics have become incomprehensible, an experience which is not helped by his tendency to change his set-list and vocals almost every performance.

Bob Dylan's strong influence over the past few years is becoming even more prominent amongst a growing group of younger emerging artists such as George Ellias and Devendra Banhart. Dylan's early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has shown steadfast devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country/blues to rock and roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway.

Dylan performs with the guitar, keyboard and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s. He has also recently performed alongside other iconic artists, such as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Although his contributions as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.  

Nobel Prize for Literature (2016)  - On October 13, 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”. The prestigious award has been given annually since 1901 and previous Nobel Laureates for Literature include Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett.

The Killers,"There are at least five artists which use, or have used, this name:
1) an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001
2) a Uruguayan rock band from the early 1970s
3) an American hardcore band from Chicago, IL, from the 1990s
4) an American band from Cleveland, Ohio, from the 1980s
5) a British punk rock band from the 1970s
6) An American doo wop group from the 1950s

1. The Killers is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001 and consist of Brandon Flowers (vocals, keyboards), Dave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals), Mark Stoermer (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion). The band's four studio albums to date have sold in excess of 18 million copies worldwide combined. The band got its name from the fictional band ""The Killers"" in the video for New Order's ""Crystal"". The band was on hiatus, but returned to the studio to record their 4th studio album in early 2011. Songfacts reports that ""Runaways"", the first single from ""Battle Born"", was released on July 10, 2012. 
Initially, The Killers played at large clubs in Las Vegas. With the band's line-up stable and their repertoire of songs expanding, the band began to attract attention from talent bookers, local agents, major label, scouts — and a UK representative for Warner Bros. Though the Warner Bros representative passed on the band, he took the demo back with him, showing it to a friend who worked at UK (London-based) indie label Lizard King Records (now Marrakesh Records). The Killers then signed in the summer of 2002 to a British label.
They released their debut album ""Hot Fuss"" on June 2004 in the United Kingdom and US (on Island Records). Their first single was ""Somebody Told Me"". The band also had chart success with their singles ""Mr. Brightside,"" which reached the Top 10 in the UK when released, and ""All These Things That I've Done"".
The band started recording its second album, ""Sam's Town"" on February 15, 2006, at The Palms Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas. It was released on October 2006. Lead singer, Brandon Flowers said that Sam's Town is ""one of the best albums of the past 20 years"". Though the album has received a mixed response from critics and fans, it has still remained popular and sold over 4 million copies worldwide.
The first single, ""When You Were Young"" debuted on radio stations in late July 2006. In late August 2006, it was offered as a downloadable track before the album's debut. The single then entered the chart on downloads alone at #5, and the following week on its official release went to #2 in the UK. The video clip of the second single, ""Bones"", was directed by Tim Burton. The third single was ""Read My Mind"". The video was filmed in Tokyo, Japan. The last one was ""For Reasons Unknown"" released in June, 2007.
The album sold over 700,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, with a No. 2 debut on the United World chart. Brandon Flowers announced on August 22, 2007, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, at the T Vital Festival, that it would be the last time that the album ""Sam's Town"" would be played in Europe. The Killers played their last Sam's Town concert in Melbourne, Australia on November, 2007.
Much of The Killers' music is based on British influences and on the music of the 1980s, particularly New Wave. Flowers has also said in interviews that the larger-than-life sound of many of the band's songs is due to the influence of living in Las Vegas, a city where everything is about flash and who can top whom. They appreciate post-punk bands that sprang up during the 80's such as Joy Division, and they are also avowed fans of New Order (with whom Flowers has performed live), Pet Shop Boys, Dire Straits, David Bowie, The Smiths, Morrissey, Depeche Mode, U2, Queen, Oasis and The Beatles.

""Day and Age"" was the title of The Killers third studio album. The title was confirmed in an NME video interview at Reading and Leeds Festival with lead singer Brandon Flowers. The band headed to the studio in June and the album is being produced by Stuart Price. In the October 2008 edition of German magazine Musikexpress, in an article dated August 15, 2008, Keuning says the new record was 99% finished. The Killers selected Paul Normansell to do the artwork for the new album, which should include some of Normansell's artwork and portraits of the band themselves. 
Flowers also stated in an interview with Q that he was excited to play a new song called ""Tidal Wave"", influenced by David Bowie's ""Drive-In Saturday"" and ""I Drove All Night"" by Roy Orbison. The setlist of The Killers' July 29 and August 1, 2008 show at New York City's Highline Ballroom and Atlantic City's Borgata Hotel and Spa contained two new songs: Spaceman and Neon Tiger. These songs were also played at The Killers' show on July 31st at the MGM Grand at Foxwoods Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut. Spaceman and Neon Tiger are also included on ""Day and Age"". During their brief summer tour in 2008, The Killers confirmed several other potential song titles for ""Day and Age"" including ""Goodnight, Travel Well"", ""Vibration"", ""Joy Ride"", ""I Can't Stay"", ""Losing Touch"", ""Fairytale Dustland"" and ""Human"", although ""Vibration"" wasn't included.

Led Zeppelin,"Led Zeppelin were an English rock band originally formed in 1968 by guitarist Jimmy Page under the name ""The New Yardbirds"", based on Page's previous band, The Yardbirds. The band formed when Jimmy Page (guitar) recruited Robert Plant (vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin), and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven blues-rock sound, Led Zeppelin are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock music. However, the band's individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre. Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of ""album-oriented rock"".

Thirty years after disbanding following Bonham's death in 1980, the band continues to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success, and broad influence. The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They have had all of their original studio albums reach the top ten of the Billboard album chart in the US, with six reaching the number one spot.

Shortly after their first tour, the group's eponymous first album was released on 12th January 1969. Its blend of blues and rock influences with distorted amplification made it one of the pivotal records in the evolution of heavy metal music. Although several of Led Zeppelin's earliest songs were based on or were cover versions of blues standards, others such as ""Communication Breakdown"" had a unique and distinctively heavy sound. Led Zeppelin also featured delicate acoustic guitar on ""Black Mountain Side"" in which the influence of Davy Graham can be heard, and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on the reworked folk song ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"". The immediate success of the first album kick-started the band's career, especially in the United States, where they would frequently tour. 

The second record, simply titled Led Zeppelin II, followed in similar style later that year, and was an even greater success for the group, reaching the number-one chart position in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were blues fanatics; their first album included the Willie Dixon song ""You Shook Me"", and their later hit ""Whole Lotta Love"" was lyrically very similar to an earlier Dixon song. (The band were subsequently accused of using his lyrics without crediting Dixon, and it was not until Chess Records brought suit fifteen years later, that proper credit - and a monetary settlement - was given.) 

The band also loved American rock and roll; the exuberant styles of Fats Domino and Little Richard were inspirations, and Led Zeppelin would perform rockabilly songs originally made famous by Elvis Presley and Eddie Cochran. Onstage, Led Zeppelin concerts could last more than three hours; expanded, improvised live versions of their song repertoire often incorporated tight workouts of James Brown, Stax, and Motown-influenced soul music and funk (favourites of bassist Jones and drummer Bonham).

For the writing of the music on their third album, Led Zeppelin III, the band retired to Bron-yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales. This resulted in a more acoustic sound (and a song ""Bron-yr-Aur Stomp"", misspellt as ""Bron-y-Aur Stomp"" on the album cover) strongly influenced by Celtic and folk music. Led Zeppelin III also ushered in an era of unique album jackets, this one featuring a wheel that displayed various images through cutouts in the main jacket sleeve when rotated. In November 1970 Led Zeppelin's record label, Atlantic Records, released ""Immigrant Song"" as a single against the band's wishes (Atlantic had earlier released an edited version of ""Whole Lotta Love"" which cut the 5:34 song to 3:10). It included their only B-side, ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"". Even though the band saw their albums as indivisible, whole listening experiences - and their manager, Peter Grant, maintained an aggressive pro-album stance - nine other singles were released without their consent. The group also resisted television appearances, which would have reduced their ability to control their presentation and sound quality. Lack of Zeppelin television exposure also enforced the band's preference that their fans hear and see them in person.

Their fourth album, Led Zeppelin IV was actually untitled, but is commonly referred to as Zoso, Runes, The Fourth Album, Sticks, Man with Sticks, or Four Symbols; it featured ""Stairway to Heaven"", which Jimmy Page performed on stage on a custom-built double-necked electric Gibson guitar, the top neck a twelve-stringed version.

Over twenty-five years after disbanding in response to drummer John Bonham's tragic death in 1980, Led Zeppelin continue to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success and influence.

Since they disbanded, Page, Plant, and Jones have only played together on rare occasions. Page and Plant did get back together to record No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded as part of the MTV Unplugged series in 1994, which was accompanied by a worldwide tour, and again in 1998 for the studio album Walking Into Clarksdale. John Paul Jones also has performed since the break up - at the Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester, Tennessee. He was part of a ""SuperJam"" featuring himself on bass, Ben Harper on guitar, and Ahmir ""?uestlove"" Thompson on drums. He also played as a guest during the sets of various other artists throughout the weekend. 

Most recently Led Zeppelin have reformed (with Jason Bonham filling in on drums) for a one-off reunion concert in memory of Atlantic Records co-founder and executive Ahmet Ertegün. After a postponement due to Jimmy Page fracturing one of his fingers, the group performed on 10th December 2007 at the O2 Arena, London. The concert was filmed for a potential DVD release.  Jimmy Page has hinted that the group may start work on new material, and that a world tour may be in the works.

Michael Jackson,"Michael Joseph Jackson (born August 29, 1958 in Gary, Indiana, died June 25, 2009 in Los Angeles, California), often referred to as The King of Pop, is the biggest-selling solo artist of all time, with over 750,000,000 sales. Jackson is an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and double inductee to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. His awards include 8 Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, and 26 Billboard Awards. He is also credited for popularizing many physically complicated dance moves, such as the robot and the moonwalk, and has influenced and spawned a whole generation of a wide variety of artists including Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey and Usher, among others.

Jackson's musical career began in 1967 as lead singer of The Jackson 5, when the group made their first recording with a local label before signing up with Motown Records in 1968. He made his first solo recordings in 1971 while still a member of the group. But it was Off the Wall (1979) which marked the start of his full-fledged solo career, and he formally parted with his siblings in 1984. In his solo career, Jackson recorded and co-produced the best-selling album of all time, Thriller (with worldwide sales over 100 million), received thirteen Grammy awards and charted thirteen #1 singles in the U.S. Throughout his four-decade career, Michael Jackson has been awarded numerous honors, including the World Music Awards Best-selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium. He is also a double-inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997, and in 2001 as a solo artist. He is also a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the mid-1980s, TIME magazine described Jackson as ""the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley"". He has had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world while also tearing down racial barriers and paving the way for modern pop music.

From 1988 to 2005, Jackson lived on his Neverland Ranch property, on which he built an amusement park and private zoo for the enjoyment of economically disadvantaged and terminally ill children. In 1993 and 2003, separate accusations of child molestation that allegedly occurred in Neverland were made against Jackson, which drew intense negative media coverage. While he was never charged for the first case, Jackson was tried and vindicated in 2005 of the latter allegation, but moved out of the US shortly thereafter. He later returned to Las Vegas in early 2007. 

Over the past few years Jackson has made numerous public appearances including MTV Japan's VMA awards where he accepted the legends award; the World Music Awards where he accepted the Diamond Award for selling over 100 million records; James Brown's funeral where he paid tribute and delivered his sermon; and a fan appreciation event in Tokyo, Japan, where he also greeted troops at US Army base Camp Zama. In early 2008, Jackson issued Thriller 25th Anniversary, a critical, and commercial success that is currently the second-biggest selling album of 2008 with over 2.1 million copies sold worldwide.

On June 25, 2009, Jackson collapsed at a rented home in Holmby Hills in Los Angeles, California. The cause of death is currently believed to be cardiac arrest. At the time of his death, Jackson was scheduled to perform 50 sold-out concerts to over one million people, at London's O2 arena, from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. During a publicity press conference, Jackson made suggestions of possible retirement.

In the hours following Jackson's death, his record sales increased dramatically. His seminal album Thriller climbed to number one on the American iTunes music chart, while another eight have made it into the top 40. In the UK, where Jackson would have performed less than three weeks after his death, fifteen of his albums occupied the top 15 spots on the Amazon music chart. Social music network website Last.fm also saw a dramatic increase in Michael Jackson plays per hour after the announcement of his death.

On December 10, 2010, a compilation album of previously unreleased material, simply entitled Michael, was released posthumously. Featuring guest performances by Akon, 50 Cent and Lenny Kravitz, the album was certified Platinum in 18 countries but received mixed reviews from most critics.  This was followed in November 2011 by Immortal, a remix album; in September 2012 by Bad 25, a 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson's 1987 hit album Bad; and by  Xscape, a second compilation album released in May 2014.

Just as the group's lineup has changed, the band's sound has evolved throughout the years, starting off as a post-punk band similar to Wire and Gang of Four before morphing into a gothic rock band in the early 80's, to a synthpop group in the mid-80's and a power-pop-alternative band in the early 90's. The Cure has always been an alternative and very independent band which was evident from the early days. Shunning the anarchistic tendencies of many punk bands after their formation in 1976 , The Cure's first release was Killing an Arab, based on material from French writer Albert Camus' ""L'Etranger"" (translated into English as The Stranger or The Outsider). This track courted controversy because of its theme (misinterpreted as racist, it was in fact, about the futility of killing any ethnicity), but it started to secure a small following, which grew following the release of debut album Three Imaginary Boys and non-LP single Boys Don't Cry in 1979, the latter of which would become one of The Cure's most famous songs.  At that time, The Cure embarked on tour as the support for Siouxsie & the Banshees' Join Hands Tour. After the sudden departure of guitarist John McKay, Robert was recruited as guitarist for the Banshees as the band 'felt he was the only person capable of taking on the task.' As a result, Robert completed the tour playing two sets a night with The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

Following this, The Cure moved from their punk leanings into the portentous post-punk territory, releasing three albums of doom-laden rock in three years, Seventeen Seconds, Faith and Pornography, the latter of which charted inside the UK top 10, though the band were repeatedly dogged by the ""Second-class Joy Division"" tag. Following their third set of line-up changes, the group released Japanese Whispers, a compilation of three singles and their b-sides. Through their desire to escape the Joy Division description, the singles were a poppier effort, featuring danceable tracks like Let's Go To Bed alongside pop songs like Love Cats. Following the commercial disappointment of follow-up album The Top in 1984, The Cure returned to form with 1985's The Head On The Door. Featuring the singles In Between Days and Close To Me, The Head on the Door was distant from the band's punk roots, having more in common with successful alternative bands like The Smiths and Echo & The Bunnymen than their gloomier roots.

Two years later, the eighth studio album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me was a more stadium-sized effort, though featuring audacious pop songs like Why Can't I Be You, it was seemingly caught between two styles. However, it was the band's ninth effort (following the departure of last surviving founder member other than Robert Smith, Lol Tolhurst), Disintegration, that would be their greatest success, both critically and commercially. Disintegration spawned hit singles like Lullaby (no.5 in the UK), Love Song (an impressive no. 2 in the USA), Pictures of You, and Fascination Street. The album itself was a culmination of The Cure's directions through the eighties, featuring the poppier side combined with the more tender aspects, as well as the gloomier facets.

Following this, a remix compilation named Mixed Up was released in 1990, featuring one new track, Never Enough, and two years later tenth studio album Wish surfaced, which was a hit mainly from the momentum gained by Disintegration, though it also featured their most famous pop song, Friday I'm In Love (no.6 in the UK and no.18 in the US). During the years following this, the band became distracted and discouraged by the lawsuit launched by former member Lol Tolhurst, who felt he had been deprived of royalties. As a result, the 1996 album Wild Mood Swings felt unfocused, and was a critical and commercial failure, though the single Mint Car was a moderate hit.

In 1997, The Cure released the compilation Galore, featuring new song Wrong Number. Three years later, at the release of original album Bloodflowers, Robert Smith announced it would be the last album for the band, the album itself being a return to the gloomier rock of Pornography and Faith. Resultantly, another hits compilation was released in 2001. However, in 2004, the band surprised all by returning with a self-titled album, their twelfth studio album, which was a surprise hit, reaching the US Top 10, its lead single - The End of the World  - becoming a modest hit on Modern Rock radio, and receiving a relatively warm reception from the press. 

In May 2005, Smith fired Roger O'Donnell and Perry Bamonte from the band, along with Bamonte's brother Daryl, who had been The Cure's tour manager for many years. The remaining members of the band (Robert Smith, longtime bassist Simon Gallup and Jason Cooper) made a few appearances as a trio before it was announced that founding member Porl Thompson would be returning to The Cure.

In early 2007 the band toured Asia and Oceania, but a planned North American tour in Autumn 2007 was delayed until Spring 2008 so the band could continue recording their next album.

The band released their thirteenth album 4:13 Dream on 27 October 2008. Four singles and a remix EP called ""Hypnagogic States"" were releases on the 13th of each month preceding the album's release.

 In 2009, Robert Smith won the Godlike Genius award at the NME Awards. On April 19, 2009, the band performed at the Coachella Festival in California.

During 2010, Robert Smith contributed songs to the soundtrack of the Tim Burton film ""Alice in Wonderland"" and provided guest vocals on the songs ""Not in Love"" by Crystal Castles and ""Come to Me"" by 65daysofstatic.

Between 31 May 2011 and 1 June 2011, the band performed three concerts at the Sydney Opera House performing the entirety of one of their first three albums on each night. Porl Thompson did not perform with the band at any of the concerts, but Roger O'Donnell performed with the band for the ""Seventeen Seconds"" and ""Faith"" concerts, and co-founding member Lol Tulhurst performed with the band for the first time since 1988 for the ""Faith"" concert. As of 2011, O'Donnell has returned to the lineup officially. In 2012, the band added former Tin Machine guitarist Reeves Gabrels to the lineup. 

In 2013 The Cure started The Great Circle Tour, headlinig festivals in Japn, South Korea and North America. In 2014 Robert Smith announced the upcoming release of a new album, to be called 4:14 Scream, featuring 14 songs recorded during the 4:13 Dream sessions and also an accompanying double album 4:26 Dream containing all the tracks from those sessions.

Gorillaz,"Gorillaz are a British virtual band formed in 1998 by  Damon Albarn of  Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl. They had the idea to create the band while watching MTV in their London flat and originally intended to call the project Gorilla.

The band consists of four fictional band members: 2-D (vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass), Noodle (guitar, vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums). These characters only appear in animated form and are not alter-egos of real people, as is often mistakenly assumed. There is an extensive fictional back-story behind these band members, written by Albarn and Hewlett. Their albums, several of their music videos, and their autobiographical book Rise Of The Ogre all tell the saga. Damon Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor to the band, which is also a collaboration between various musicians. Their style is broad with a large number of alternative influences including rock, hip-hop, and electronica.

They have released four studio albums: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010) and The Fall (Also in 2010). Additionally, they have put out two B-side collections, G-Sides (2001) and D-Sides (2007), and a reggae remix of the Gorillaz album entitled Laika Come Home (2002). The band has also released three DVDs: Phase One: Celebrity Takedown, Demon Days: Live at Manchester Opera House, and Phase Two: Slow Boat To Hades. At the end of 2010, Gorillaz released their next album, The Fall, which was recorded during their US 'Escape to Plastic Beach' tour. It is promoted as being the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website.

The band's first single, Clint Eastwood, was released on 5 March 2001. This single was the first of four from Gorillaz, which was released  on 26 March 2001. The other three singles were released over the next year. These were: 19-2000, Rock the House, and Tomorrow Comes Today. The album sold over 7 million copies worldwide and has gone platinum twice in the United Kingdom earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request. Collaborators on the first album included Del tha Funkee Homosapien (often mistaken as a band-member), Miho Hatori (formerly of Cibo Matto), Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads.and Ibrahim Ferrer. The album was produced by Dan the Automator.

At the end of 2001 the band released another single, 911, which was a collaboration between Gorillaz and rap artists D12, Eminem and Terry Hall. The single was from the soundtrack to the 2002 action comedy Bad Company.

Their second studio album, Demon Days, was released on 11 May  2005 and included the hit singles Feel Good Inc., DARE, Dirty Harry and Kids With Guns / El Mañana. Demon Days went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States, and earned five Grammy award nominations for 2006 and won one of them (Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals). Collaborators on this album (produced by Dj Danger Mouse) include De La Soul, Bootie Brown of The Pharcyde, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Neneh Cherry, Ike Turner, MF Doom, and Roots Manuva, amongst others.

In late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on Carousel, a new Gorillaz project which eventually evolved into the band's third studio album, Plastic Beach, which was released 9 March 2010. Albarn said, ""I'm making this one the most pop record I've ever made in many ways, but with all my experience to try and at least present something that has got depth.” The album features guest performances by Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Gruff Rhys, Mark E. Smith, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon,  Kano, Bashy, De La Soul, Little Dragon, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, sinfonia ViVA, and The Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. 

A 3D projection of the group was shown at the 2005 MTV Music Awards and the 2006 Grammys. They also performed at the Brits, in a different format, using screens rather than projections. Gorillaz have performed live in other occasions as well: in 2001 & 2002 they did tours where the musicians played behind screens, and in 2005 & 2006, Gorillaz had five nights in Manchester and New York respectively. This time the screens were behind the musicians, who were visible to the audience only as silhouettes (except for the guest-stars).

Since the band began to achieve mainstream success, there have been rumours of them working on a full-length movie. Some of these have been confirmed, but nothing has gotten beyond planning stages, mainly due to conflicts between the band and studios involved. In 2008, Hewlett said ""Ultimately we didn't think that feel we're in a position to make the kind of movie we want to make with Gorillaz at the moment. [...] But I'd still like to make a full, lavishly-animated Gorillaz movie someday.""

Albarn and Hewlett created a Pop Opera called Monkey: Journey to the West, which premiered in the summer of 2007 at the Manchester International Festival. A soundtrack album was recorded in the summer as well (initially only digitally available though a CD version was released in 2008). The production went on to show at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris in September-October 2007, the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, SC, USA in May 2008, and the Royal Opera House in London in July 2008.

The duo behind the Pop Opera built on ideas from Monkey: Journey to the West to release a short film in the Summer of 2008 which accompanied the United Kingdom's coverage of the BBC Olympic Coverage in Beijing. It featured a basic outline of the main plot elements of the Opera, reworked into a ""Journey to the East"", with the characters finishing in the Beijing Olympic Stadium. 

Gorillaz headlined the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2010, as an immediate replacement for U2, who dropped out of performing at the festival.

At the end of 2010 Gorillaz released their next album The Fall made in the hotel rooms during their US tour. It is the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website and was available for free download for a limited time.

In April 2012, Albarn told The Guardian that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were ""unlikely"".

Linkin Park,"Linkin Park is an American band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Its following studio album, Meteora, continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth greatest band of the music video era and the third best of the new millennium behind Oasis and Coldplay.

Having adapted the nu metal and rap metal genres to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight, which was released in 2007. The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third best debut week of any album that year. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others included on Reanimation. The band's most recent studio album, A Thousand Suns, was released on September 8, 2010. Linkin Park has sold over 50 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.

Charity:

Oasis,"There are multiple artists who have used the name Oasis:

1. Oasis were an English rock band that formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as The Rain, the group was formed by Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums, percussion), who were soon joined by Liam's older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals).

Its members were signed to independent record label Creation Records and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe in 1994, including hits like Live Forever and Supersonic.

The following year, the band recorded the critically acclaimed (What's the Story) Morning Glory? with their new drummer Alan White that led to international success propelled by singles Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger and Champagne Supernova. In 1997, Oasis released third album and became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, aside Michael Jackson's Bad. McGuigan and Arthurs left the band as they went on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and were replaced by Gem Archer and Andy Bell who joined the group for the recording of Heathen Chemistry.

In August 2009, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from the band. Liam Gallagher initially stated that Oasis were ""done"", but later in February 2010 announced that the remaining members of the band would continue to record music, and did not rule out the possibility of retaining the Oasis name. However, Liam and other former members of the band are instead continuing under the name Beady Eye and Noel has formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.

2. American rock band:  Oasis was an American rock band from Marin County, California active in the 1970s. Their sound has been described as psychedelic folk rock, progressive folk and psychedelic pop, characterized by male/female harmonies. With the help of David Crosby of famed Crosby, Stills & Nash, they recorded one album, Oasis, released on the Cranbus label in 1973.

Members Shelly Fox was previously in Cookin Mama, and Stephen Barncard also worked with Chet Nichols and David Crosby. Kelly Bryan had earlier been in the short-lived Grootna, and later played on a couple of albums by Jesse Colin Young.

Between 1971 and 1978 members of Oasis also recorded under the name RJ Fox and completed an album for Atlantic in 1971 which was never released. A double disc collection of Oasis and RJ Fox material was compiled by the Black Bamboo label in 1998. RJ Fox: Retrospective Dreams included the lost LP, tracks from the Oasis album and many others.

3. American deep house producers: Oasis is a collaboration between Omar-S (Alex O. Smith) and Shadow Ray from Detroit.

4. British classical group: Oasis was a short-lived English classic group active through 1984-1988 featuring Peter Skellern, Julian Lloyd Webber (later replaced by Audrey Riley), Mitch Dalton, Bill Lovelady and Mary Hopkin. Oasis released only self-titled album and two singles and toured till 1988.

Foo Fighters,"Foo Fighters are an American rock band formed by singer/guitarist/drummer Dave Grohl in 1995 in Seattle, USA. Grohl formed the group as a one-man project after the dissolution of his previous band Nirvana in 1994. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters in 1995, Grohl drafted Nate Mendel (bass), William Goldsmith (drums) (both of Sunny Day Real Estate and The Fire Theft), and Pat Smear (guitar) (of The Germs) to complete the group. Goldsmith left during the recording of the group's second album The Colour and the Shape (1997), soon followed by Smear. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl left prior to the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999).

Chris Shiflett joined as the band's second guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album One by One in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and harder-rocking material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace in 2007. Over the course of the band's career, three of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album, and all six have been nominated for Grammys. The band's seventh album Wasting Light was released in 2011 and peaked at #1 in several countries.

Formation and debut album
Dave Grohl joined the band Nirvana as the group's drummer in 1990. In order to occupy himself during tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the band; he said in 1997, ""I was in awe of frontman Kurt Cobain's songs. And intimidated. I thought it was best that I keep my songs to myself."" Instead, Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos, and even issued a cassette of some of those songs called Pocketwatch under the pseudonym ""Late!"" in 1992.

Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, and Nirvana subsequently disbanded. Grohl received offers to work with various artists, and almost accepted a permanent position as the drummer in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered a studio in October 1994 to record twelve of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on ""X-Static"" by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. ""I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life,"" Grohl later said. ""I thought that I would rather do what no-one expected me to do. I enjoy writing music and I enjoy trying to sing, and there's nothing anyone can really do to discourage me."" Grohl completed an album's worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for feedback.

Grohl hoped to keep his anonymity and release the recordings in a limited run under the title ""Foo Fighters"", taken from the World War II term ""foo fighter"", used to refer to unidentified flying objects. According to Rope Songfacts, he was reading a book about military World War II sightings at the time and he wanted people to think it was a band. So he called it Foo Fighters as it was plural. However, the demo tape circulated in the music industry, creating interest among record labels. Grohl formed a band to support the album. Initially, Grohl talked to former Nirvana band mate Krist Novoselic about joining the group, but both decided against it. ""For Krist and I, it would have felt really natural and really great"", Grohl explained. ""But for everyone else, it would have been weird, and it would have left me in a really bad position. Then I really would have been under the microscope."" Having heard about the disbanding of Seattle-based emo band Sunny Day Real Estate, Grohl drafted the group's bass player, Nate Mendel, and drummer, William Goldsmith. Grohl asked Pat Smear, who served touring guitarist for Nirvana after the release of its 1993 album In Utero, to join as the group's second guitarist. Grohl ultimately licensed the album to Capitol Records, releasing it on his new record label, Roswell Records.

The group played its debut show at a keg party in February 1995. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album. Foo Fighters undertook their first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for Mike Watt. The band's first single ""This Is a Call"" was released in June 1995, and its debut album Foo Fighters was released the next month. ""I'll Stick Around"", ""For All The Cows"" and ""Big Me"" were released as subsequent singles. The band spent the following months on tour, including their first appearance at the Reading Festival in England in August.

The Colour and the Shape
After touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered a studio in Woodinville, Washington with producer Gil Norton to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he wasn't happy with how the mixes were turning out, and the band ""basically re-recorded almost everything"". During the L.A. sessions, Grohl played drums on some of the songs. Goldsmith said Grohl did not tell him that he recorded new drum parts for the record and, feeling betrayed, left the band.

In need of a replacement for Goldsmith, Grohl contacted Alanis Morissette's touring drummer Taylor Hawkins to see if he could recommend anybody. Grohl was surprised when Hawkins volunteered his own services as drummer. Hawkins made his debut with the group in time for the release of its second album, The Colour and the Shape, in May 1997. The album spawned the singles ""Monkey Wrench"", ""My Hero"", and ""Everlong"".

Pat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band to pursue other interests. Four months later in September 1997 at the MTV Video Music Awards, Smear simultaneously publicly announced his departure from the band and introduced his replacement, Grohl's former Scream bandmate Franz Stahl. Stahl toured with the band for the next few months, and appeared on two tracks that the band recorded for movie soundtracks, a re-recording of ""Walking After You"" for The X-Files and ""A320"" for Godzilla.

There Is Nothing Left to Lose
In 1998, Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl's home state of Virginia to write music for its third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, ""In those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't"". Grohl was distraught about the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, in Grohl's Virginia home studio. The album spawned several singles, including ""Learn to Fly"", the band's first single to reach the US Hot 100.

Before the release of the album, Capitol president Gary Gersh was forced out of the label. Given Grohl's history with Gersh, Foo Fighters' contract had included a ""key man clause"" that allowed them to leave the label upon Gersh's departure. They subsequently left Capitol and signed to RCA, who later acquired the rights to the band's Capitol albums.
Chris Shiflett joined Foo Fighters as a touring guitarist before becoming a full member

After recording was completed, the band auditioned a number of potential guitarists, and eventually settled on Chris Shiflett, who previously performed with No Use for a Name and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Shiflett initially joined the band as touring guitarist, but achieved full-time status prior to the recording of the group's fourth album.

That same year, Foo Fighters established a relationship with rock band Queen, of whom the band (particularly Grohl and Hawkins) are fans. Guitarist Brian May added a guitar track to Foo Fighters' second cover of Pink Floyd's ""Have a Cigar"", which appeared on the soundtrack to the movie Mission Impossible 2. When Queen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001, Grohl and Hawkins were invited to perform with the band on ""Tie Your Mother Down"", with Grohl filling in on vocals for Freddie Mercury. In 2002, guitarist May contributed guitar work to ""Tired of You"" and an outtake called ""Knucklehead"". The bands have performed together on several occasions since, including VH1 Rock Honors and Foo Fighters' headlining concert in Hyde Park.

One by One
Near the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record their fourth album. After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, Grohl spent some time helping Queens of the Stone Age complete their 2002 album Songs for the Deaf. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, Grohl, inspired by the sessions, decided to reconvene Foo Fighters to rework a few songs on their album. Instead, they re-recorded nearly all of the album (save ""Tired of You"") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's studio in Virginia. The final album was released in October of 2002 under the title One by One. Singles from the album included ""All My Life"", ""Times Like These"", ""Low"", and ""Have It All"". The band later expressed displeasure with the album. Grohl told Rolling Stone in 2005, ""Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it.""

For most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004 prior to donating 3 million dollars to the new Pittsburgh Penguins arena, upon learning that George W. Bush's presidential campaign was using ""Times Like These"" at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to John Kerry's campaign. Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets. The entire band eventually joined Grohl for a performance in Arizona coinciding with one of the presidential debates.

In Your Honor and acoustic tour
Having spent a year and a half touring behind One By One, Grohl did not want to rush into recording another Foo Fighters record. Initially Grohl intended to write acoustic material by himself, but eventually the project involved the entire band. To record its fifth album, the band shifted to Los Angeles and built a recording studio, dubbed Studio 606 West. Grohl insisted that the album be divided into two discs–one full of rock songs, the other featuring acoustic tracks. In Your Honor was released in June 2005. The album's singles included ""Best of You"", ""DOA"", ""Resolve"", ""No Way Back"", and ""Miracle"".

On June 17, 2006, Foo Fighters performed their largest non-festival headlining concert to date at London's Hyde Park. The band was supported by Juliette and the Licks, Angels & Airwaves, Queens of the Stone Age, and Motörhead. Motörhead's Lemmy joined the band on stage to sing ""Shake Your Blood"" from Dave Grohl's Probot album. Also, as a surprise performance, Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen jammed with Foo Fighters, playing part of ""We Will Rock You"" as a lead into ""Tie Your Mother Down"".

In further support of In Your Honor, the band decided to organize a short acoustic tour for the summer of 2006. The tour included former member Pat Smear, who rejoined the band as an extra guitarist, Petra Haden on violin and backup vocals, Drew Hester on percussion, and Rami Jaffee of The Wallflowers on keyboards/piano. While much of the setlist focused on In Your Honor's acoustic half, the band also used the opportunity to play lesser-known songs such as ""Ain't It The Life"", ""Floaty"", and ""See You"". The band also performed ""Marigold"", a Pocketwatch-era song that was best-known as a Nirvana B-side.

In November 2006, the band released their first ever live CD, Skin and Bones, featuring fifteen performances captured over a three-night stand in Los Angeles. An accompanying DVD was released, and featured tracks not available on the CD.

Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace
For the follow-up to In Your Honor, the band decided to call in The Colour and the Shape producer Gil Norton. Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace was released in September 2007. The album's first single, ""The Pretender"", was issued to radio in early August. The second single, ""Long Road to Ruin"", was released in December 2007, supported by a music video directed by longtime collaborator Jesse Peretz (formerly of the Lemonheads).

In mid-to-late 2007 ""The Pretender"" topped the Modern Rock chart for a record 18 weeks, it also gave the band their third consecutive year at the top (a record), and made them the only artist besides Red Hot Chili Peppers to have 4 consecutive albums have songs reach the top (RHCPs have 5). When ""Long Road to Ruin"" reached the top it gave them their fourth consecutive year to have a song reach the top (breaking their own record). When the fourth single, ""Let It Die"", reached the top 20 it gave them 3 songs in the top 20, one of only four artists to do this. ""Let It Die"" is also the album's third Number One hit on the chart.

Not long after completing the recording sessions for the album, the band participated in Live Earth at Wembley Stadium in London, England, performing the penultimate set of the night. Later that summer, the band headlined V Festival 2007, including a surprise acoustic set on the Channel 4 stage under the name 606. In October 2007, Foo Fighters started their world tour in support for Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace. The band performed shows throughout the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada and Asia. The band finished its world tour in September 2008 at the Virgin Festival at Toronto Island Park in Canada.

Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace was nominated for 5 Grammys in 2008. The Foo Fighters went home with Best Rock Album and Best Hard Rock Performance (for ""The Pretender""). The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, while ""The Pretender"" was also nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rock Song.

On 17 September 2008 Dave Grohl announced on The Chris Moyles Show that the band would be taking a long break from music so that they could return with a new sense of purpose, and also informed fans not to expect any new music for a while. ""We've never really taken a long break, I think it's time,"" Grohl commented. ""After doing Wembley, we shouldn't come back there for 10 years because we've played to everybody. We're over in the UK every year, every summer, so I think it's time to take a break and come back over when people really miss us.""

 Wasting Light 

After taking a break from music, Foo Fighters returned in 2011 with the album Wasting Light. The album was recorded in Dave Grohl's garage, as opposed to Studio 606. Grohl addressed by stating ""There's poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a garage."" Wasting Light features many guest musicians, including Krist Novoselic, who had played with Grohl in Nirvana. 

Foo Fighters released a 30 second teaser on January 17th 2011 of the song ""Bridge Burning"", and on February 1st 2011 the announcement of the release date of the album, April 12th 2011, was accompanied by a 30 second teaser of ""Miss the Misery"". On February 12th, the music video for ""White Limo"" was released. And on February 23rd ""Rope"" was released for online streaming. 

On March 1st ""Rope"" was released as the first single from the album. It peaked at number 1 in the US on the Rock, Alternative, and Mainstream Rock charts.

On April 9th the band appeared on Saturday Night Live (host Helen Miren). They played the song ""Rope"" for their first performance, and debuted the song ""Walk"" for their second. 

Wasting Light peaked at number 1 on the Albums chart in 12 countries, including the US and UK. It has achieved platinum status in Australia and New Zeland. 

Musical style
When Grohl first started the band, its music was often compared to that of his previous group, Nirvana. Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, ""Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down."" Foo Fighters also utilize the Pixies' technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud chorus, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana ""liking the Knack, Bay City Rollers, The Beatles, and Abba as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag, I suppose"". Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar similar to how he approached playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, ""I could hear the song in my head before it was finished."" Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.

The members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with harder sounds. Grohl noted in 1997, ""We all love music, whether it's the Beatles or Queen or punk rock. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.""

Campaigning and activism
In 2000, the band generated controversy through their public support of Alive & Well, an organization that denies the link between HIV and AIDS, questions the validity of HIV tests, and advises against taking medication to counter the disease. Foo Fighter bassist Nate Mendel learned of Alive & Well through What If Everything You Thought You Knew about AIDS Was Wrong?, a self-published book written by Christine Maggiore, the organization's founder. Mendel passed the book around to the rest of the band, who supported his advocacy.

In January 2000, the band played a benefit concert for the organization, which Mendel helped to organize. The band also contributed songs to The Other Side of AIDS, a controversial documentary film by Maggiore's husband Robin Scovill, which questions whether HIV is the cause of AIDS. The band's position caused alarm in the medical community, as Alive & Well's advice ran contrary to established medical wisdom about HIV and AIDS. In a 2000 interview, Mendel spoke of using Foo Fighters' popularity to help spread the group's message and of holding more benefits for the organization. However, no further benefits have taken place, and the band has since removed the organization from its list of supported causes. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
