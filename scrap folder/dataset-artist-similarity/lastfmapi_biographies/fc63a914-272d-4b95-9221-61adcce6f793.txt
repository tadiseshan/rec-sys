Gal Costa (born September 26, 1945 in Salvador, Brazil), is a popular singer in Brazil.      Influenced by music from a young age by her record store owner father, Costa became one of Brazil’s foremost female [tropicalismo](http://www.last.fm/tag/tropicalismo) movement singers and guitar players during the late 1960s and 70s. Along with her friend [Maria Bethânia](http://www.last.fm/music/Maria+Beth%C3%A2nia), she became a political activist often coming into conflict with Brazil’s government when dissent in music was censored. Fellow musician [Caetano Veloso](http://www.last.fm/music/Caetano+Veloso), Maria Bethânia’s brother, introduced her to [Gilberto Gil](http://www.last.fm/music/Gilberto+Gil) and [Tom Zé](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Z%C3%A9) in 1963, who managed to secure her a recording deal in São Paulo for her debut album Domingo with [Caetano Veloso](http://www.last.fm/music/Caetano+Veloso). In 1973, the cover of Costa’s album “India” was censored due to her wearing a risque red bikini. Costa has recorded songs composed by a number of Brazil’s most popular songwriters such as [Antônio Carlos Jobim](http://www.last.fm/music/Ant%C3%B4nio+Carlos+Jobim), [Jorge Ben Jor](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Jorge+Ben+Jor), and [Erasmo Carlos](http://www.last.fm/music/Erasmo+Carlos). In 1982 the single “Festa do Interior” from the double album “Fantasia” became her biggest ever hit, going multi-platinum by the end of the year. Costa appeared in the 1995 film “The Mandarin” (“O Mandarim) as the singer [Carmen Miranda](http://www.last.fm/music/Carmen+Miranda). She has recorded songs in Portuguese, Spanish and English.
