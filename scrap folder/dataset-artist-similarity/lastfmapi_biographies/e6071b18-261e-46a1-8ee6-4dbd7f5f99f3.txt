Ribot’s earliest session work was featured on Tom Waits’ Rain Dogs (1985) and helped define Waits’ new musical direction. Ribot worked with Waits on many of his following albums including Franks Wild Years (1987), Big Time (1988), Mule Variations (1999), Real Gone (2004), Orphans (2006) and Bad as Me (2011). He has appeared on Elvis Costello’s Spike, Mighty Like a Rose (1991), and Kojak Variety (1995). Ribot has appeared on numerous recordings by John Zorn, including many of Zorn’s Filmworks recordings, solo performances on Zorn’s Masada Guitars (also featuring Bill Frisell and Tim Sparks), and is a member of Zorn’s Bar Kokhba Sextet and Electric Masada. Ribot’s first two albums featured The Rootless Cosmopolitans, followed by an album of works by Frantz Casseus for solo guitar. Further releases found him working in a variety of band and solo contexts including two albums with his self-described “dance band”, Marc Ribot y Los Cubanos Postizos (The Prosthetic Cubans), featuring compositions by Arsenio Rodríguez.   Ribot admitted to Guitar Player a relatively limited technical facility due to learning to play right-handed despite being left-handed: “That’s a real limit, one that caused me a lot of grief when I was working with Jack McDuff and realizing I wasn’t following in George Benson’s footsteps. I couldn’t be a straight-ahead jazz contender if you held a gun to my head, but that begs the question of whether I would want to be one.”   He currently performs and records with his group Marc Ribot’s Ceramic Dog with bassist Shahzad Ismaily and drummer Ches Smith of the avant-garde band Secret Chiefs 3
