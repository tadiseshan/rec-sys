Born in 1968 in Rome, Alex Britti began playing the guitar at the age of 8. From the outset he showed a passion for blues and at 17 formed his first trio, which enjoyed success in renowned Rome night-life venues such as Big Mama. He took part in the Italian blues festival and played together with the legendary Louisiana Red. His horizons gradually broadened and he became the supporter for American bluesmen passing through Italy (Paul Jones, Buddy Miles, Billy Preston). In 1990 he worked with Rosa King and accompanied her on a tour across half of Europe. In the meantime he had begun writing songs in Italian. While not abandoning his instrumental performances, in 1992 he made his singer-songwriter debut with the CD “Alex Britti”, released by Fonit Cetra. In 1994 and 1995 he was invited with his trio to the “Primo Maggio” show in Rome. Over the next few years his musical activity expanded to take on a wide variety of forms: in 1995 he was a regular guest on the programme “Generazione X” and took part in the play “Radio Estetica” by F. Bertini. He also worked in the cinema and composed the soundtracks for “Uomini senza donne” (1995) and “Stressati” (1996). In 1996 he signed a new record contract and published his first single CD “(Quello che voglio)”. On 4 May 1998 he opened BB King’s concert in Milan. He recorded another single as a singer-songwriter “(Solo una volta)”, the song becoming the hit of the summer. The album that finally established his reputation, “It.Pop”, was released in the winter of 1998. In 1999 he won the new singer category at Sanremo. In 2000 he released his second album, entitled “La vasca”.      <http://www.italica.rai.it/eng/principal/topics/bio/britti.htm>
