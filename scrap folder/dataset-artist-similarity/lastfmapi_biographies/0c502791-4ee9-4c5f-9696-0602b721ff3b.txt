**Electric Light Orchestra** were a [symphonic rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/symphonic%20rock) band which formed in Birmingham, England in 1970. The band was formed by [Jeff Lynne](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Lynne) (vocals, guitar, multiple instruments), [Roy Wood](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Wood) (multiple instruments, vocals), [Richard Tandy](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Tandy) (keyboards, vocals) and [Bev Bevan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bev+Bevan) (drums). Lynne, Wood and Bevan were former members of the psychedelic rock band [The Move](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Move). The band’s lineup would fluctuate throughout its original incarnation, although Lynne, Tandy and Bevan would remain constant members.      They incorporated the sounds of string ensembles, vocoders and dub echos into rock songs, thereby creating a very sophisticated studio version of rock. The musical content of ELO songs often went far beyond usual chord structures, mixing pop songwriting with classical romanticism and synthesized sounds. The band claim that their music “picks up where [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles)’ 1967 song [I Am the Walrus](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/I+Am+the+Walrus) left off.”      Formed in 1970 by [Roy Wood](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Wood), [Jeff Lynne](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Lynne) and [Bev Bevan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bev+Bevan) (the remaining members of the 1960s rock group [The Move](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Move)). The band used cellos, violin, horns and woodwinds to give their music a classical sound. This was an idea Roy Wood initially had while with The Move, to take rock music in a new direction. In 1970 when [Carl Wayne](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Wayne) left the The Move, Jeff Lynne, front man with fellow Brum band [Idle Race](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Idle+Race), responded to Wood’s second invitation to join the line-up, with the lure of starting the new band. To help finance the fledgling project, two more Move albums were released during the recording of their eponymous first album in 1971 which produced the UK hit [10538 Overture](http://www.last.fm/music/Electric+Light+Orchestra/_/10538+Overture). In the US this album was released with the mistaken title of [No Answer](http://www.last.fm/music/Electric+Light+Orchestra/No+Answer), due to a mix-up with an uncompleted telephone call to the American label and subsequent secretarial message.      However, tensions soon surfaced between Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne. With most of the media attention focused on Roy Wood, differences in musical direction, and a disastrous first live outing, it was no surprise when the band went through the first of its many line-up changes as Wood took [Hugh McDowell](http://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+McDowell) and [Bill Hunt](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Hunt) with him to form [Wizzard](http://www.last.fm/music/Wizzard)
