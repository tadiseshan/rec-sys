Juice Newton was born Judith Kaye Newton on 18 February 1952 in Lakehurst, New Jersey and grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She is an American pop music and country singer. She managed to mix folk, rock, blues and pop into a hugely successful career in country music. To date she has sold over 10 million albums, managed 19 hit singles across the US country, pop and adult contemporary charts. She has also won 2 Billboard Awards, 1 Grammy and the CMA Award for Best New Female Artist.      Shortly after high school, Juice and her band Silver Spur were signed to RCA Records. They released three albums and had only one charted single, “Love Is a Word”. Juice signed with Capitol in 1978, dropping the Silver Spur name (though they would remain the backup band). That year, she had her first country top-40 single in [Let’s Keep It That Way](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/_/Let%27s+Keep+It+That+Way), followed by the single [It’s A Heartache](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/_/It%27s+A+Heartache), which was quickly overshadowed by [Bonnie Tyler](http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Tyler)’s version. The 1980 album [Take Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/Take+Heart) featured five more charted singles, including the covers of the ’60s [Elvie Sands](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvie+Sands) hit [Any Way That You Want Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/_/Any+Way+That+You+Want+Me) and the 1972 [John Edwards](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Edwards) classic [Sunshine](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/_/Sunshine). The latter became her second top-40 single on the country charts.      In 1981, Juice’s breakthrough album, simply titled [Juice](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/Juice), was released. It spawned her biggest country hits so far, each crossing over into the pop top 10: [Angel of the Morning](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/_/Angel+of+the+Morning) (a hit for [Merrilee Rush](http://www.last.fm/music/Merrilee+Rush) in 1968, written by [Chip Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Chip+Taylor)), [Queen of Hearts](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/_/Queen+of+Hearts), and a song recycled from 1975, [The Sweetest Thing (I’ve Ever Known)](http://www.last.fm/ music/Juice+Newton/_/The+Sweetest+Thing+\(I%27ve+Ever+Known\)), which earned her her first country #1. A fourth top-40 country hit [Ride ‘Em Cowboy](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/_/Ride+%27Em+Cowboy) was released from her 1984 [Greatest Hits (And More)](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/Greatest+Hits+\(And+More\)) collection. [Juice](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton/Juice) sold over a million copies in the US and 300,000 in Canada.      In 1982, Juice released the successful follow-up, Quiet Lies which went gold in the US and platinum in Canada
