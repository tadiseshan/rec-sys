Born in 1961 in Mali, Issa Bagayogo is a skilled player of the _kamele [n’goni](http://www.last.fm/tag/ngoni)_, a traditional lute-like instrument. Bagayogo deftly melds Malian instruments and song structures (long, repeated musical phrases over which singers and players improvise and choruses chant—the best-known performer of this music is [Ali Farka Touré](http://www.last.fm/music/Ali+Farka+Tour%C3%A9)) with dub, trance, and electronic elements. He does it so effectively that, as with his debut album _Sya_ (1999), the result feels like a fully-integrated merger of the two traditions rather than the shotgun marriage that “world music” can sometimes seem like.      Bagayogo’s subsequent albums are _Timbuktu_, _Tassoumakan_ and _Mali Koura_. In addition, his work is available in various compilations of contemporary Malian and African music He has released four fBagayogo blends his native Malian traditions with western pop music and has drawn comparisons to some of the great Malian musicians such as Ali Farka Touré and Toumani Diabaté.[2]      Sya, originally released in 1998, was the first album released under Six Degrees Records. The second album is titled Timbuktu, after the ancient city in Mali. The album covers issues such as racial tolerance, regional pride, and drug abuse among youths. Bagayogo continues his fusion of his native African style music with electronic beats on this album.      In 2004, Bagayogo released his album called Tassoumakan, which means “voice of fire”, followed by Mali Koura in 2008ll-length albums all under the record label Six Degrees Records.
