Steven Patrick Morrissey, better known as Morrissey, is an English singer and lyricist born in Davyhulme, Lancashire, United Kingdom on May 22, 1959.      He was the lead singer of [The Smiths](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths), one of the most influential alternative bands in the 1980s. The group split up in 1987 and Morrissey started a successful solo career.      His first solo album, [Viva Hate](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/Viva+Hate) was released only six months after The Smiths split, in March 1988. The album’s first single “[Suedehead](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/_/Suedehead)” peaked at #5, a higher position than any Smiths single had ever achieved. In 1990, [Bona Drag](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/Bona+Drag), a collection of his solo singles and b-sides, including popular songs such as “[The Last of the Famous International Playboys](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/_/The+Last+of+the+F amous+International+Playboys)” and “[Everyday Is Like Sunday](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/_/Everyday+Is+Like+Sunday)” (which also appears on “Viva Hate”)      His second album 1991’s [Kill Uncle](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/Kill+Uncle) was not as well received as his first, with neither single achieving the Top 20. In 1992, the Mick Ronson-produced [Your Arsenal](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/Your+Arsenal) was released and included singles such as “[Tomorrow](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/_/Tomorrow)” and “[We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/_/We+Ha te+It+When+Our+Friends+Become+Successful)”. A live album, [Beethoven Was Deaf](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/Beethoven+Was+Deaf), followed in 1993.      In 1994, Morrissey released [Vauxhall and I](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/Vauxhall+and+I), which contained “[The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/_/The +More+You+Ignore+Me,+the+Closer+I+Get)”, his biggest hit in the United States, where it peaked at #46. Later that year, Morrissey also recorded a one-off project with Siouxsie of [Siouxsie and the Banshees](http://www.last.fm/music/Siouxsie+and+the+Banshees): they sang in duet on the single [Interlude](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Morrissey+ and+Siouxsie/_/Interlude).      After “Vauxhall and I”, Morrissey released [Southpaw Grammar](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/Southpaw+Grammar) (1995) and [Maladjusted](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/Maladjusted) (1997), both of which failed to produce a UK Top 20 single.      A period of musical inactivity followed in the late 90s and early 2000s, which was due to failure in finding a suitable label, according to a 2004 interview with [Jools Holland](http://www.last.fm/music/Jools+Holland). After seven years without a new album release, [You Are The Quarry](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/You+Are+The+Quarry) was released on May 17, 2004 (but one day later in the USA)
