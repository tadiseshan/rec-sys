[Miranda Lambert](http://www.mirandalambert.com) is a [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) who gained fame as a finalist on the 2003 season of USA Network’s talent competition Nashville Star.      **Biography**      Miranda Lambert was born on November 10, 1983 in Lindale, Texas, about 80 miles east of Dallas. Both of her parents are private investigators, but father Rick is also a country guitarist and songwriter. Lambert became seriously interested in country music after attending a [Garth Brooks](http://www.last.fm/music/Garth+Brooks) concert as a young girl, and soon began singing in talent contests under the tutelage of her father.      At 16, Miranda began appearing on the Johnny High Country Music Review in Arlington, Texas, the same show that helped launch the career of [LeAnn Rimes](http://www.last.fm/music/LeAnn+Rimes). Miranda quickly landed a recording session in Nashville, but left the studio in tears after she became frustrated with the “pop” sound of music that was not her own. Upon returning to Texas, Miranda began writing songs and taking guitar lessons from her father.      When Miranda’s aptitude for music became apparent, her parents encouraged her to aggressively pursue singing and acting opportunities. While still a high school student, Miranda made her professional singing debut and fronted the house band at the Reo Palm Isle Ballroom in Longview, Texas, a long-running venue that has showcased [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley) and [Willie Nelson](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson).      Foregoing college, Miranda performed throughout Texas in 2001 and 2002. She finished first in the Texas auditions for Nashville Star and eventually placed third on the national competition.      **Discography**      On September 15, 2003, she signed with Sony records. She has since released three studio albums, 2005’s [Kerosene](http://www.last.fm/music/Miranda+Lambert/Kerosene), 2007’s [Crazy Ex-Girlfriend](http://www.last.fm/music/Miranda+Lambert/Crazy+Ex-Girlfriend), 2009’s [Revolution](http://www.last.fm/music/Miranda+Lambert/Revolution) and 2011’s [Four the Record](http://www.last.fm/music/Miranda+Lambert/Four+the+Record); all four of which debuted at #1 on the U.S. _Billboard_ Top Country Albums chart. _Kerosene_,_Crazy Ex-Girlfriend_ and _Revolution_ have been certified Platinum by the RIAA.
