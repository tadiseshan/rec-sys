Gonzalo Rubalcaba (born May 27, 1963 in Havana,Cuba) is a jazz pianist. A prolific virtuoso and composer, he fuses Cuban and American influences into a powerful and innovative hybrid. Known for his stupefying and unbridled command of the keyboard throughout the 90s, his recent work has shown broader range.      He used to play with drummer Horacio ‘El Negro’ Hernández in the 80’s, back in the days when they were still unknown in the international musical scene; They went to an european jazz festival and from there they began their flight to history.   ********************************************************************************************************************   The following info was collected from <http://www.g-rubalcaba.com/g-rubalcaba.bio.html>      Gonzalo Julio Rubalcaba was born in Habana, Cuba, May 27, 1963, into a musical family rich in the traditions of the country’s artistic past.   During his childhood, in addition to the standard fare of elementary schools,   Gonzalo was absorbing his Cuban musical heritage through personal contacts within his family, notably his father,   pianist Guillermo Rubalcaba, and leading musicians who were frequent houseguests: Frank Emilio, Peruchin, Felipe Dulzaides and others.   He also assimilated through scarce and treasured recordings the tunes and styles of 40’s – 70’s US jazz masters:   Thelonius Monk, Bud Powell, Oscar Peterson among pianists; and instrumentalists Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Art Blakey.      Gonzalo loved drumming, and early in his career studied both piano and drums.   He began his classical musical training at Manuel Saumell Conservatory at age 9,   where he finally had to choose piano; he moved up to “middle-school” at Amadeo Roldan Conservatory,   and finally earned his degree in music composition from Havana’s Institute of Fine Arts in l983.   By that time he was already playing in clubs and music halls in Havana.   With Orquesta Aragon he toured France and Africa in 1980.   He introduced his own “Grupo Projecto” to the North Sea and Berlin Festivals in l985.      In July 1990 he appeared as a surprise guest with Charlie Haden and Paul Motian at Montreux Festival, Switzerland,   in a historic performance (available as the CD Discovery).   Egrem Studios of Havana was the first to record his music during the early and mid ‘80’s,   and these discs are still being released (recently Inicio, an album of piano solos, and Concierto Negro.)      Beginning in 1986 Gonzalo began recording for Messidor of Frandfurt, Germany,   and put out three superb albums for that label with his Cuban Quartet, Mi Gran Pasion, Live in Havana, and Giraldilla.   1986 was also notable because of his chance meeting in Havana with bassist Charlie Haden.   Through Charlie he came to the attention of Blue Note Records’ president, Bruce Lundvall, and thus began an association,   first with Toshiba/EMI of Japan, and later with Blue Note in the US, which has resulted in eleven discs being released
