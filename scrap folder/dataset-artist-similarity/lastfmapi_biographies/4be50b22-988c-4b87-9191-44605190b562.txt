Keith Hudson aka the “Dark Prince of Reggae” (1946 in Kingston, Jamaica - 1984 in New York, USA), was a Jamaican reggae artist and record producer. He is known for his influence on the Dub movement. Raised in a musical family, Hudson first worked as a dentist but soon was hanging out with musicians like [Don Drummond](http://www.last.fm/music/Don+Drummond/). So, he really entered the music business in 1968 by producing [Ken Boothe](http://www.last.fm/music/Ken+Boothe)’s Jamaican hit “Old Fashioned Way”. In the following months he worked with [Delroy Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Delroy+Wilson) and [John Holt](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Holt) and was the first to record DJ [U Roy](http://www.last.fm/music/U+Roy) in 1969 with Dynamic Fashion Way. Other DJ productions included tunes with [Dennis Alcapone](http://www.last.fm/music/Dennis+Alcapone) and [Big Youth](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Youth) (“S 90 Skank”) released in 1972 became the DJ’s biggest hit. In 1975, Hudson released his classic [Pick A Dub](http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Hudson/Pick+A+Dub), widely considered to have been the first deliberately thematic dub album, with tracks specifically mixed in the dub style for the purpose of appearing together on an LP. His album [Rasta Communication](http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Hudson/Rasta+Communication/) (1978) was well received by a wider audience and is considered a roots reggae classic. Hudson died of lung cancer in 1984.
