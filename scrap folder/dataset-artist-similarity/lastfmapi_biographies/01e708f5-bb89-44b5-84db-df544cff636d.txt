Tommy Roe (born Thomas David Roe, 9 May 1942, Atlanta, Georgia, USA) is an American pop music singer-songwriter. Best-remembered for his hits “Sheila” (1962) and “Dizzy” (1969), Roe was “widely perceived as one of the archetypal bubblegum artists of the late 1960s, but Roe also cut some rockers early in his career.      Roe was raised in Atlanta, Georgia where he attended Brown High School and was part of band. Greatly influenced by the sounds of the late Buddy Holly, Tommy Roe developed a unique style that, combined with his All-American clean-cut image, made him a popular musical performer throughout the 1960s. In April of 1961 he became a father to daughter Cynthia; he has 3 grandchildren.      Roe had a Billboard No.1 hit record hit in the United States and in Australia in 1962 with the song, “Sheila” and the following year scored two Top 10 hits with “Everybody” and the critically acclaimed “The Folk Singer” written by Merle Kilgore. Following the enormously successful tour of the United Kingdom by friend Roy Orbison, Tommy Roe toured there and then moved to England where he lived for several years. In 1965, he and Jerry Lee Lewis combined with Orbison to create an LP for the Pickwick International label. During the 1960s, he had several more top forty hits. In 1969, his song “Dizzy” went to No.1 on the UK Singles Chart as well as to Billboard’s No.1 in the USA. His final Top 40 single was “Jam Up and Jelly Tight” in 1970.      A resident of Beverly Hills, California, Roe is married to Josette Banzet, an actress from France who won a Golden Globe Award for best supporting for her performance in the 1976 television mini-series, Rich Man, Poor Man. His daughter Cynthia still resides in Georgia with her family.      In 1986, Tommy Roe was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.      Although his style of music declined in popularity with the 1970s mass market, Tommy Roe maintained a following and continued to perform at a variety of concert venues, sometimes with sixties nostalgia rock and rollers such as Freddy Cannon and Bobby Vee.
