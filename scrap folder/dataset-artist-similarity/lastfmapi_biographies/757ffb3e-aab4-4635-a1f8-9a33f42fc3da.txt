[singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) [Charlotte Martin](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Martin) got her start singing opera while attending Eastern Illinois University in the late ’90s. Her father was a respected professor in the music department, and naturally Martin followed his footsteps. She’d been playing [piano](http://www.last.fm/tag/piano) since she was a little girl and her childhood was surrounded by music.      While attending school, Martin experienced “real life,” from living with her goth roommate and dealing with typical college-like drama to the tragic suicides of two close friends. Martin turned to music for solace. She desperately wanted to make music into a career; therefore, a whirlwind move to Los Angeles seemed like the right thing to do.      Martin eventually made a record, [One Girl Army](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Martin/One+Girl+Army), with producer Tom Rothrock ([Badly Drawn Boy](http://www.last.fm/music/Badly+Drawn+Boy), [Beck](http://www.last.fm/music/Beck), [Elliott Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith)), but it was never released. Before 2002 came to a close, Martin got her own studio and recorded a new batch of songs with Ken Andrews ([Air](http://www.last.fm/music/Air), [Pete Yorn](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Yorn)). The melodic dreamscapes of [In Parentheses](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Martin/In+Parentheses) arrived in August 2003 and Martin’s bright voice drew comparisons to [Fiona Apple](http://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple) and [Kate Bush](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush). Dates with [Howie Day](http://www.last.fm/music/Howie+Day) and [Damien Rice](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Rice) also coincided with the release of the EP.      [On Your Shore](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Martin/On+Your+Shore) followed in 2004. Unfortunately, Martin’s relationship with RCA proved creatively trying as the singer/songwriter continued writing and recording new material. A decision to leave the major label in 2005 allowed Martin to accomplish her creative goals, thus reconnecting with Test-Drive Records to issue the [Veins](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Martin/Veins) and [Darkest Hour](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Martin/Darkest+Hour) EPs before the year’s end. Additional support dates around North American followed into the fall, and Martin rounded out the Veins tour with her first DVD recording, the limited-edition Something Like a DVD.      She also married her long-time collaborator and co-producer, Ken Andrews (Pete Yorn, Year of the Rabbit, Failure), in the midst of recording her second album, [Stromata](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Martin/Stromata). The album arrived on Martin and Andrews’ own Dinosaur Fight label in September 2006. (All Music Guide)      <http://www.charlottemartin.com>
