Erasmo Carlos (born Erasmo Esteves on June 5, 1941, in the Tijuca area of Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian singer and songwriter, most closely associated with his friend and longtime collaborator [Roberto Carlos](http://www.last.fm/music/Roberto+Carlos) (no relation). Together, they have created many chart hits including “É Proibido Fumar”.      A core member of the [jovem guarda](http://www.last.fm/tag/jovem%20guarda) (“Young Guard”) scene of 1960’s Brazilian [pop-rock](http://www.last.fm/tag /pop-rock), Erasmo often appeared on television, in magazines and feature films with fellow teen idols Roberto Carlos and Wanderléa.      In contrast to his simpler pop-rock early sound, Erasmo went on to produce several of the more moody and introspective [mpb](http://www.last.fm/tag/mpb) records of the 1970’s, including “Sonhos e Memórias” and “Carlos, Erasmo”.
