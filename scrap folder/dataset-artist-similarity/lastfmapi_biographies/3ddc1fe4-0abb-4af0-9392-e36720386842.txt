**Loudon Wainwright III** (born 5 September 1946 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA) is an American songwriter, folk singer, humorist, and actor. He is the father of [Rufus Wainwright](http://www.last.fm/music/Rufus+Wainwright) and [Martha Wainwright](http://www.last.fm/music/Martha+Wainwright) , children of his marriage to the late [Kate McGarrigle](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+&+Anna+McGarrigle). In 1970 he acquired a record deal with Atlantic Records, who released his first album.      A graduate of St. Andrew’s School, Wainwright is best known for a 1972 novelty song hit [Dead Skunk (In The Middle Of The Road)](http://www.last.fm/music/Lou don+Wainwright+III/_/Dead+Skunk+\(In+The+Middle+Of+The+Road\)), with pianist Teddy Wender and for playing Captain Spalding (the “singing surgeon”) on three episodes of the American television show M*A*S*H in its third season (1974-1975), but his musical reputation is much deeper. Using a witty, self- mocking style, Wainwright has recorded over twenty albums on eleven different labels. Two of his albums have been nominated for Grammy awards.      He is also a regular actor in Judd Apatow movies. His biggest role was playing the father on Judd’s show, Undeclared.      In 2012 his latest offering [Older Than My Old Man Now](http://www.last.fm/music/Loudon+Wainwright+III/Older+Than+My+Old+Man+Now) was released.      Official website : <http://www.lwiii.com/>
