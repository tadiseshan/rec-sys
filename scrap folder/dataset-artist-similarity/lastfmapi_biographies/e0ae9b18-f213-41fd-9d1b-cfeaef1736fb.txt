Jeff Deyo (pronounced DEE-yo) was the lead singer of the pioneering modern worship band SONICFLOOD, who were partially responsible for the worship music explosion within the Christian music industry in the late nineties. After one studio record and one live album SONICFLOOD imploded and later resurfaced with an entirely new line-up led by former touring bassist Ric Heil.      Deyo continued on as a solo artist honing the style he made famous in SONICFLOOD, and to date he has released 3 solo studio records: Saturate, Light, and Unveil, and one live record: Surrender. His music can be described as sunny pop-rock worship with some emotional ballads as well.
