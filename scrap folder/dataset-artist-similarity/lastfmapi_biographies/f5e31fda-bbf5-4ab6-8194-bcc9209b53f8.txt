**The Romantics** are an American [rock n roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20n%20roll) and [power pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/power%20pop) band from Detroit, Michigan. The band adopted the name “The Romantics” because it formed on Valentine’s Day, 1977. The Romantics achieved moderate popularity in the United States, Canada, and parts of Asia, Australia, Europe, and Latin America during the first half of the [80s](http://www.last.fm/tag/80s) on the strength of the band’s catchy, energetic songs and stylish, memorable music videos. Their success has ebbed and flowed, but hit singles “[What I Like About You](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Romantics/_/What+I+Like+About+You)” and “[Talking in Your Sleep](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Romantics/_/Talking+in+Your+Sleep)” remain very popular.      Influenced by [60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s) British Invasion music (such as the songs of [The Kinks](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks), [The Who](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who), [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles), [The Hollies](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Hollies), and [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones)), [70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s) Detroit garage rock and hard rock (as represented by such performers as [Iggy Pop](http://www.last.fm/music/Iggy+Pop), [The Stooges](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stooges), and the [MC5](http://www.last.fm/music/MC5)), and the classic punk of [Ramones](http://www.last.fm/music/Ramones), the Romantics play a hook-based form of rock known as [power pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/power%20pop). The band is also commonly classified into the category of “[new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave)” (probably due more to the band’s image and era than the sound of its music) by [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) music historians.      The Romantics’ original lineup consisted of rhythm guitarist/harmonica player/singer [Wally Palmar](http://www.last.fm/music/Wally+Palmar), lead guitarist [Mike Skill](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Skill), bassist [Rich Cole](http://www.last.fm/music/Rich+Cole), and drummer/singer [Jimmy Marinos](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Marinos). All four band members made songwriting contributions to the group, but Palmar and Skill were considered the band’s primary tunesmiths. After a few years of playing local and regional gigs in Detroit and the Midwest, this lineup of the Romantics recorded the band’s self-titled debut album for Nemperor Records in 1980. The album yielded the hit “What I Like About You,” which reached #48 in the US, and #12 in the Netherlands, where the band was especially popular. “What I Like About You” would become much better known later in the 1980s, when its placement in television commercials and other high profile media made it an evergreen power pop anthem. The band became as well known (if not better known) for its flashy and audacious fashion sense as it did for its exciting music
