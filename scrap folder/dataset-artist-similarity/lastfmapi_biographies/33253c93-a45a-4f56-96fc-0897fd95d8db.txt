She returned to school at the University of California at Berkeley, where she studied music theory. She went on to write several popular songs, including Little Boxes (about suburban living, said to be inspired by Daly City, California), [What Have They Done To The Rain](http://www.last.fm/m usic/+noredirect/Malvina+Reynolds/_/What+Have+They+Done+To+The+Rain) (about nuclear fallout), [It Isn’t Nice](http://www.last.fm/music/Malvina+Reynolds/_/It+Isn%27t+Nice) (a [civil rights](http://www.last.fm/tag/civil%20rights) [anthem](http://www.last.fm/tag/anthem)), [Turn Around](http://www.last.fm/music/Malvina+Reynolds/_/Turn+Around) (sung by [Harry Belafonte](http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Belafonte)), and [There’s a Bottom Below](http://www.last.fm/music/Malvina+Reynolds/_/There%27s+a+Bottom+Below) (about being [depressed](http://www.last.fm/tag/depressed)).      Only two collections of her music are available on compact disc, both on the Smithsonian Folkways label, Another Country Heard From (Folkways 02524) and Ear to the Ground (Smithsonian Folkways 40124).      A film biography, Love It Like a Fool, was made a few years before she died in 1978.      Reynolds’ most famous song, Little Boxes, has enjoyed renewed popularity by being featured in Showtime’s TV series Weeds.
