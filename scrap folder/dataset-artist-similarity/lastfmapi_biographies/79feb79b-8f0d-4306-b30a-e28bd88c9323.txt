**Alison Moyet** (born Geneviève Alison Jane Moyet on 18 June 1961 - Billericay, Essex, England), is an English [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) noted for her [bluesy](http://www.last.fm/tag/bluesy) voice.      Moyet was born to a French father and English mother. She grew up in Basildon, where she attended school. After leaving school at 16, she worked as a shop worker and a piano tuner. She was involved in a number of punk rock, pub rock and blues bands in the South East Essex area during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including The Vandals and the Screamin’ Ab Dabs, The Vicars, The Vandals (UK 1978) and [The Little Roosters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Little+Roosters).      Her mainstream pop career began in 1982 when she formed the electro-pop duo [Yazoo](http://www.last.fm/music/Yazoo) with former [Depeche Mode](http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode) member [Vince Clarke](http://www.last.fm/music/Vince+Clarke). The duo had several hits, including “Situation”, “Only You”, “Don’t Go” and recorded two albums, “Upstairs At Eric’s” and “You And Me Both”. The group was notable for melding Clarke’s trademark electronic sounds with Moyet’s warm, soulful voice.      In 1983 Moyet and Clarke decided to disband Yazoo. While Clarke went on to form [Erasure](http://www.last.fm/music/Erasure), Moyet signed to CBS (in part because it had been Janis Joplin’s label), and began her solo career.      In 1984 she released her debut album “Alf” (titled after her punk-era nickname). Alf included contributions by popular producers/songwriters Swain and Jolley, as well as a song, “Invisible”, written by Motown legend Lamont Dozier. The record was a hit in Britain, reaching number one in the album charts. Alf spawned 3 hit singles, “Love Resurrection”, “Invisible” and “All Cried Out”. In the US, “Invisible” was a Top 40 hit (something Yazoo had never achieved).      In 1985 Moyet performed at the historic Live Aid concert, alongside [Paul Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Young). She also released a single not featured on “Alf”, a cover of the standard “That Ole Devil Called Love.” The single went to #2 on the UK singles chart. (At present, it remains Moyet’s highest-charting UK single.)      In 1986 Moyet had another big UK hit with the single “Is This Love?,” followed in 1987 by the album Raindancing. Raindancing spawned further hit singles, including a cover of [Floy Joy](http://www.last.fm/music/Floy+Joy)’s “Weak In The Presence of Beauty” and “Ordinary Girl”. In 1987, she scored another cover hit with “Love Letters”; the video for the song featured comedy duo French & Saunders.      Following a period of personal and career evaluation Hoodoo was released in 1991. Hoodoo, which took several steps away from the glossy pop sheen of Raindancing and was a far earthier and more personal album. Compared to her earlier releases, Hoodoo received little label support and only minimal promotion
