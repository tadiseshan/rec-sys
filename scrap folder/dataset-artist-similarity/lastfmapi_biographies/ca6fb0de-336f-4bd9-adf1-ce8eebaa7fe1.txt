A former York University student, **Sarah Slean** is also an accomplished painter and photographer. She recorded her first album _[Universe](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/Universe)_ at the age of 19 and has since completed several other albums including: _[Blue Parade](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/Blue+Parade)_ (1998), _[Night Bugs](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/Night+Bugs)_ (2002), and _[Day One](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/Day+One)_ (2004), _[The Baroness](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/The+Baroness)_ (2008) and the double album _[Land & Sea](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/Land+&+Sea)_ (2011).      Night Bugs was her first major label album, co-produced by Slean and [Hawksley Workman](http://www.last.fm/music/Hawksley+Workman), and released by WEA in Canada and Atlantic Records in the United States. It was heavily inspired by [cabaret](http://www.last.fm/tag/cabaret) music.      In September 28, 2004, Slean released her fourth album, Day One. Here Slean’s piano takes a less important spot for the first time in her career. The focus is more on beats, rhythms and guitar, which shines through in the album’s first single “[Lucky Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/_/Lucky+Me)”. The up-tempo title track “[Day One](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/_/Day+One)”, and “[Mary](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/_/Mary)”, a song about Slean’s grandmother, were released as the second and third singles.      In October 2006, Slean released a mostly-live album, _[Orphan Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/Orphan+Music)_, which consists of songs recorded live at Toronto’s Harbourfront Theatre and the Vancouver East Cultural Centre. Other new tracks featuring Slean and the piano were recorded at DNA Recording Facility in Toronto and Kensaltown Studios in the UK.      Also in 2006, she contributed two tracks (“[Us And Them](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/_/Us+And+Them)” and “[Comfortably Numb](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/_/Comfortably+Numb)”) to _Pink Floyd Redux_, a modern 12-track tribute to [Pink Floyd](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd).      Her sixth album _[The Baroness](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/The+Baroness)_ was released March 2008. An EP with outtakes from the album, entitled _[The Baroness Redecorates](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/The+Baroness+Redecorates)_, was released in December of the same year.      Another set of B-sides was released in December 2010. For _[Beauty Lives](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Slean/Beauty+Lives)_, fans could vote for their favourite previously unrecorded track.
