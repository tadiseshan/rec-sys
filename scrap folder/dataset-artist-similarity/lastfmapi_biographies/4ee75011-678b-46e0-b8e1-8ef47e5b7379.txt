**June Carter Cash** (June 23, 1929 – May 15, 2003), born Valerie [June Carter](http://www.last.fm/music/June+Carter), was a singer, songwriter, actress, a member of the first family of country music, [The Carter Family](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Carter+Family), and the second wife of singer [Johnny Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash). She played the guitar, banjo, and autoharp.      As a singer, she had both a solo career and a career singing with, first, her family, and later, her husband. As a solo artist, she became somewhat successful with upbeat country tunes of the 1950s, like [Juke Box Blues](http://www.last.fm/music/June+Carter+Cash/_/Juke+Box+Blues). In 1962 she and [Merle Kilgore](http://www.last.fm/music/Merle+Kilgore) wrote [Ring of Fire](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Ring+of+Fire). The song documents Carter’s feelings of conflict arising from her relationship with Johnny Cash.      She won a Grammy Award in 1999 for her solo album, [Press On](http://www.last.fm/music/June+Carter+Cash/Press+On). Her last album, [Wildwood Flower](http://www.last.fm/music/June+Carter+Cash/Wildwood+Flower), was released posthumously in 2003 and won two additional Grammys.
