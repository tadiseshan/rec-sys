Originating from New York State, [Terra Naomi](http://www.last.fm/music/Terra+Naomi) is an independent [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) who was based in London, [United Kingdom](http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom) but now lives in Los Angeles. She sings, plays the guitar and piano, and writes her own music. She has toured the country on a number of occasions and in 2006 devised a “Virtual Summer Tour”, which involved recording videos of her performing her own songs, covers and requests in her apartment, and then broadcasting them on her [MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/terranaomi), later on YouTube. This gained her many new fans, and her song [Say It’s Possible](http://www.last.fm/music/Terra+Naomi/_/Say+It%27s+Possible) led to well over a hundred “covers” being uploaded by fans, including versions in spanish, french and chinese. In March 2007, it won the YouTube award for ‘Best Music Video’.      In April 2006 [Terra Naomi](http://www.last.fm/music/Terra+Naomi) was part of a 100-piece choir who recorded for [Neil Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young)’s album [Living With War](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Living+With+War). This was an influential experience for her, inspiring the song [Something Good To Show You](http://www.last.fm/music/Terra+Naomi/_/Something+Good+To+Show+You) which has become the title for a “pro-humanity”, anti-war project hoping to unite people with similar visions and helping them to make a difference to the way we live.      [Terra Naomi](http://www.last.fm/music/Terra+Naomi) interacts closely with her fans, making use of the Internet - her [blog](http://terranaomi.blogs.com/naomiland) gives an insight into her life and shares her passionate views on some issues.
