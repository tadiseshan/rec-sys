A native of Canada, Tamia got an early start in the music industry, singing on “You Put a Move on My Heart,” the first single from Quincy Jones’ 1994 hit album Q’s Jook Joint, when she was only a teenager. That paved the way for the release of her debut album in 1998.      Tamia was born and raised in Windsor, Ontario. As a child, she took acting and singing lessons, eventually performing in a number of local choirs and theatrical presentations. She soon earned a reputation and several awards, including the YTV Vocal Achievement Award in 1993. The following year, she won the Steve Ross Music Scholarship at the American Academy of Achievement’s Annual Salute to Excellence in 1994. That same year, she attended a party her manager Brenda Richie held for Luther Vandross. At that party, she met Quincy Jones, who became taken with Tamia’s talent. By the end of the year, she had sung “You Put a Move on My Heart” for Jones’ new album, Q’s Jook Joint. The song became a Top Ten R&B hit and earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance; another song on the album, a duet with Babyface entitled “Slow Jams,” was nominated for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. She also sang “Missing You” with Brandy, Gladys Knight, and Chaka Khan on the soundtrack for the 1995 film Set It Off. “Missing You” was also nominated for a Grammy, making for a total of three nominations for Tamia before she had even released an album.      Such exposure, plus nominations from the NAACP Image Awards and the Soul Train Music Awards, made Tamia a hot commodity in the music industry
