Laura Cantrell (born 16 July 1967 in Nashville, Tennessee) is a country singer-songwriter and radio DJ. Beginning in 1993, she presented a weekly country and old-time music radio show on WFMU called The Radio Thrift Shop (although since October 2005 she has only made occasional appearances on the station). She reached wider recognition in 2000 with her debut album, [Not The Tremblin’ Kind](http://www.last.fm/music/Laura+Cantrell/Not+The+Tremblin%27+Kind).      Host of freeform radio station WFMU’s “Radio Thrift Shop,” sometime VP at a merchant bank, and owner of one of the purest voices in country, Laura Cantrell’s mix of traditional and modern country has been impressing listeners for several years. The late, great John Peel thought her first album was one of the most perfect records he’d ever heard and in the opinion of many listeners he wasn’t wrong. Laura excels both as a songwriter and as an interpreter of both new and classic country - her Southern roots and mix of traditional and modern approaches, impeccable taste and superb voice make her work accessible to anyone who enjoys country.      Cantrell may also be familiar to fans of [geek rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/geek%20rock) for her guest vocals on the [They Might Be Giants](http://www.last.fm/music/They+Might+Be+Giants) song “[The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)](http://www.last.fm/music/They+Might+Be+Giant s/_/The+Guitar+\(The+Lion+Sleeps+Tonight\))” (on the 1992 album “[Apollo 18](http://www.last.fm/music/They+Might+Be+Giants/Apollo+18)).      In the spring of 2011, Cantrell released “Kitty Wells Dresses: Songs Of the Queen of Country Music”, a recording she made “in honor of one of her heroines, the great Kitty Wells” (the album title being from an original song of Cantrell’s written in tribute to Wells).
