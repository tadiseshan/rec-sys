**Roberta Flack** (b. 1937) is a U.S. singer and pianist.      Born on 10th February 1937 in Asheville, North Carolina, Flack performs in the areas of jazz, soul, and folk, and is best known for singles such as “Killing Me Softly with His Song”, which won the 1974 Grammy for Record of the Year, and “Where Is the Love”, which was one of her many duets with [Donny Hathaway](http://www.last.fm/music/Donny+Hathaway).      Flack began her professional career recording for Atlantic Records without much success, until one of her earliest recordings, “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” (1969), was included on the soundtrack to Clint Eastwood’s directorial debut _Play Misty for Me_; it became a number-one hit in 1972.
