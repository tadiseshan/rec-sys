Arista Records announced its newest artist in mid-2006, [Paula DeAnda](http://www.pauladeanda.com), a teenage singer/songwriter, whose debut album hit stores on August 29th, 2006.      Paula DeAnda is part of the groundswell of rhythmic radio/Latin musical performers based in Corpus Christi, TX. Her first single, “Doing Too Much”, broke out of the Southwest with massive radio play at the Rhythmic format. It went on to become a crossover hit, reaching the top 20 of the Pop charts.      DeAnda auditioned for Clive Davis and A&R Senior VP Steve Ferrera and was signed on the spot. “Doing Too Much” was co-written by DeAnda and Baby Bash, and produced by Happy Perez. DeAnda writes her own material and has been performing since the age of 11. Her more recent single was entitled, “Easy” and featured such artists as [Bow Wow](http://www.last.fm/music/Bow+Wow), [Corey Franks](http://www.last.fm/music/Corey+Franks) and [Lil Wayne](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Lil+Wayne).      Commented Clive Davis, Chairman, BMG US Label Group: “Paula auditioned for us in my office, singing acappella and dazzled everyone. She has a powerful voice and is a triple threat as a writer and arranger. Signing her was a no brainer.”      DeAnda was born in San Angelo, TX, and moved with her family to Corpus Christi with her family in 2002 to start her career as a musical artist. At age 11, DeAnda was already singing background vocals on Spanish and Tejano records. DeAnda has performed at concerts opening for Nelly, Akon, Frankie J and Baby Bash, to name a few.
