Emma Lee Bunton (born 21 January 1976 in Finchley, London, England, United Kingdom) is an English pop singer, songwriter, and occasional actress, originally from the girl group [Spice Girls](http://www.last.fm/music/Spice+Girls), where she was known as “Baby Spice”.      She started her solo career in 1999 with a collaboration single along with Tin Tin Out for their single “What I Am”, which peaked number 2 on the UK charts. Her debut solo album entitled “A Girl Like Me” was released in 2001, and spawned the UK number-one hit “What Took You So Long?”, as well as the top five hits “What I Am” (a cover of a 1998’s song earlier recorded by Edie Brickell & New Bohemians) and “Take My Breath Away” (which was not a cover of Berlin’s 1986’s hit), and top twenty hit “We’re Not Gonna Sleep Tonight”. The album sold around 125,000 in the UK.      In spring of 2003, she returned as Emma (losing the Bunton), with the top five hit “Free Me” and later that year released “Maybe”, which also went top ten and outsold the previous single. In spring of 2004, the single “I’ll Be There” and the album “Free Me” were released. The album contained ’60s-style pop gems and went on to outsell her first album, something other solo Spice Girls have yet to achieve. The album Free Me was released in the United States on January 25, 2005.      Emma released “Downtown” the official charity single for the BBC’s 2006 Children in Need appeal, it reached number three. The album “Life in Mono” was released on (4 December).
