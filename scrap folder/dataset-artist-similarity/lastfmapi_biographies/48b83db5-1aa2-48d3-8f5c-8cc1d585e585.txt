Pernice Brothers is an [indie pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20pop) group based in Massachusetts, USA. The band was formed in 1997 by [Joe Pernice](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Pernice).      Massachusetts-born Pernice had begun his recording career in the country-rock [Scud Mountain Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/Scud+Mountain+Boys). He left the band, and most of its country music trappings, to pursue pure pop.      The Pernice Brothers also included Joe’s brother [Bob Pernice](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Pernice) on guitar (hence the name), [Peyton Pinkerton](http://www.last.fm/music/Peyton+Pinkerton) (guitar), Mike Deming (piano), bassist [Thom Monahan](http://www.last.fm/music/Thom+Monahan), and [Aaron Sperske](http://www.last.fm/music/Aaron+Sperske) on drums.      The band’s first release was 1998’s Overcome By Happiness. They have since recorded four more studio albums: _The World Won’t End_ (2001); _Yours, Mine & Ours_ (2003), _Discover A Lovelier You_ (2005), and _Live A Little_ (2006). They released a live album, _Nobody’s Watching/Nobody’s Listening_ in 2004. Pernice has also made two solo outings, one under the name [Chappaquiddick Skyline](http://www.last.fm/music/Chappaquiddick+Skyline).      Their music is distinguished by Pernice’s silky, breathy vocals, reminiscent of [Colin Blunstone](http://www.last.fm/music/Colin+Blunstone) or [Nick Drake](http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Drake). He cites many musical influences: [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra) and [Sammy Davis Jr](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sammy+Davis+Jr), as well as [Jimmy Webb](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Webb), [The Carpenters](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Carpenters), and [The Bee Gees](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Bee+Gees). The deceptive simplicity, seductive melodies and soaring choruses of his songs also attract comparisons with the [Beach Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Beach+Boys), [Big Star](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Star), [The Hollies](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Hollies) and [The Zombies](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Zombies). Yet the band can as easily sound like [The Cure](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure) or [New Order](http://www.last.fm/music/New+Order).      Pernice is also a fine lyricist (he has a master’s degree in creative writing). His songwords show that Pernice can not only tackle difficult and offbeat subjects, but that he has a [Morrissey](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey)-esque dark sense of humour too.
