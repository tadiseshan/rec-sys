Emma Louise Niblett (born 29 September 1973) is a British [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), known by the pseudonym **Scout Niblett**, from Staffordshire, England, United Kingdom. Her music is frequently [minimalist](http://www.last.fm/tag/minimalist) in style, many of her songs consisting merely of vocals accompanied by either drums or guitar, which she mostly plays herself. Niblett released her debut album in 2001 and released two more albums before 2005 when she settled in Portland, Oregon, where she currently resides. Niblett later worked with the influential [producer](http://www.last.fm/tag/producer) [Steve Albini](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Albini).      Niblett grew up in Nottingham, England and chose her stage name in honour of Jean Louise “Scout” Finch, the protagonist in Harper Lee’s 1960 novel To Kill a Mockingbird. She studied music and performance art at college, and also expresses an interest in astrology—explaining the title of her 2005 LP _[Kidnapped by Neptune](http://www.last.fm/music/Scout+Niblett/Kidnapped+By+Neptune)_, she says, “Neptune is this planet that everyone has in their chart. But for me, where Neptune is right now and has been for the past two years has been affecting my chart in a huge way. Neptune is kind of the musicians’ planet, it rules music.”      Niblett has released three LPs, through the [Secretly Canadian](http://www.secretlycanadian.com/home.php) record company in North America and through [Too Pure](http://www.toopure.com/) in the [United Kingdom](http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom).

Shortly after this she released her first LP _[Sweet Heart Fever](http://www.last.fm/music/Scout+Niblett/Sweet+Heart+Fever)_, recorded in Glasgow with drummer Kristian Goddard. Her follow-up release was a one-sided 10” EP, _[I Conjure Series](http://www.last.fm/music/Scout+Niblett/I+Conjure+Series)_, recorded live, where Niblett plays all the instruments herself. For the next two albums—2003’s _[I Am](http://www.last.fm/music/Scout+Niblett/I+Am)_ and 2005’s _Kidnapped by Neptune_—Niblett enlisted the help of producer Steve Albini.
