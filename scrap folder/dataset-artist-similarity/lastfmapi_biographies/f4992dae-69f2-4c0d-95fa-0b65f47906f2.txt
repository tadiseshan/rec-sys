Shelby Lynne (born Shelby Lynn Moorer, October 22, 1968, Quantico, Virginia) is an American singer, songwriter and actress.      Lynne’s first recording for Epic was a duet with [George Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Jones), “If I Could Bottle This Up”, which became a top-50 hit in 1988. In 2000 she won a Grammy award for “Best New Artist”, despite the fact that she had been recording and releasing records for more than ten years      With Tears, Lies, and Alibis the follow-up to 2008’s Just A Little Lovin’ and the first release on her own label, Everso Records, Shelby Lynne affirms her position as a visionary, iconoclastic artist who deftly weaves country, soul, rock, blues, pop and folk influences to forge her own unique style. Like Identity Crisis (2003) and Suit Yourself (2005), this sparse, unguarded collection was produced by Lynne, who evokes a live-in-the-studio vibe from a stellar group of musicians. Born in Quantico, VA, she grew up in Jackson, AL and headed to Nashville at an early age. At 18, Lynne s demos landed her an appearance on TNN s Nashville Now series, which led to a Top 50 duet ( “If I Could Bottle This Up” ) with George Jones and a record deal. Following the release of the critically acclaimed I Am Shelby Lynne in 2000, she won the GRAMMY® for Best New Artist. She made her acting debut in 2005, playing [Johnny Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash)’s mother in the Fox Searchlight motion picture Walk the Line.
