**John Anthony Frusciante** (born in New York on March 5th 1970) though probably best known for his time as guitarist of the [Red Hot Chili Peppers](http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers), is a respected, acclaimed and prolific solo artist in his own right. Joining the Chili Peppers in 1988 after the death of **Hillel Slovak**, the band’s original guitarist, Frusciante was featured on both _Mother’s Milk_ and _Blood Sugar Sex Magik_. However, John’s rise was short lived. On May 7th, 1992, John quit the band just before the Chili Peppers were due on stage. (He did however play the show). His departure was considered a result of dissatisfaction with the level of rapid fame the band was achieving, as well as heavy fatigue from touring.       In 1994, John released _Niandra Lades & Usually Just A T-Shirt_, his first solo album. Some of the material had already been recorded whilst he was on tour. Many fans consider this album to be his best solo album which included many bizarre and aptly named songs such as “My Smile is a Rifle” and “Running Away Into You”.      After his departure from the Chili Peppers, John slipped further into the world of drugs. In 1997, his second solo album, _Smile From The Streets You Hold_, was released. According to Frusciante, this album was released solely to raise money for his drug habit. It was later withdrawn from sale in 1999. He would later state on multiple occasions that 1997 was the worst year of his life.      John’s heavy drug usage had brought him close to death on multiple occasions. It was with suggestion from his band mate Flea, who kept contact with John still, that he checked himself into rehab to overcome his habits. In 1998, he was asked to re-join the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He said yes, and in 1999, _Californication_ was released with John back on guitar. His reappearance in the public eye was greeted with some shock, as there were many tales of his terrible descent into addiction, but it was clear to everyone who listened to Californication that Frusciante was truly back. The album, featuring the [guitar](http://www.last.fm/tag/guitar) skills of Frusciante, was a sonic celebration of life and rebirth (“Scar Tissue”), and also an exploration of Hollywood superficiality (“Californication”).      Over the time spent touring and recording Californication, John created a set of his own songs that would come forth on his next solo album, _To Record Only Water for Ten Days_. Retaining his lyrical style, John pursued a different direction, and spewed a heavily synthesized album.      _From the Sounds Inside_ was an internet-only release that made its debut on his official website. The album, which stretches over 21 songs, is comprised mainly of unfinished and unmastered demos from his Record Only Water era.      The highly anticipated follow-up to Californication, which was to be titled _By The Way_, was released in 2002
