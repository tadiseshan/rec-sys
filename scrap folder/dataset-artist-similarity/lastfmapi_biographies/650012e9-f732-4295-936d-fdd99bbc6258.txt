Michael Franti (born April 21, 1966, in Oakland, California) is an African, Irish, and German American poet, musician, and composer. Franti is the creator and driving force behind [Michael Franti & Spearhead](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Franti+&+Spearhead), a band that blends hip hop with a variety of other styles including funk, reggae, folk, and rock.      Franti was part of the industrial punk band [The Beatnigs](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatnigs) with DJ Rono Tse, which released a self-titled LP, and an EP _Television_ on [Jello Biafra](http://www.last.fm/music/Jello+Biafra)’s [Alternative Tentacles Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Alternative+Tentacles+Records). His next project, [The Disposable Heroes Of Hiphoprisy](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Disposable+Heroes+Of+Hiphoprisy), found Franti continuing his collaboration with Tse, and working with jazz guitarist [Charlie Hunter](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Hunter), and electronic musicians [Mark Pistel](http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Pistel) ([Consolidated](http://www.last.fm/music/Consolidated)) and [Jack Dangers](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Dangers) ([Meat Beat Manifesto](http://www.last.fm/music/Meat+Beat+Manifesto)). The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy wrote biting, progressive lyrics that railed against the injustice of the world and yearned for democratic reform, set to a fusion of industrial and hip hop. Their first album won acclaim for its social commentary, and they were chosen by [U2](http://www.last.fm/music/U2) to open for their Zoo TV Tour.      Franti and the Disposable Heroes put together another record of music accompanying novelist [William Burroughs](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/William+Burroughs)’ readings for an album entitled Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales. This album diverged greatly from the style of the band’s previous work, as they were largely providing musical background and accompaniment to Burroughs’ spoken readings from several of his books.      In 1994, Franti formed a new band called [Spearhead](http://www.last.fm/music/Spearhead). While he continued to create politically and socially conscious lyrics, Spearhead’s music drew more from funk and soul than the industrial sound of his previous groups. Spearhead released their first album, _Home_, in September of 1994. Their follow up album _Chocolate Supa Highway_ was released in March of 1997. It should be noted that these two albums were released under the band name “Spearhead”, while the name on all subsequent albums would be “Michael Franti & Spearhead”.      In 1999, Franti retreated from the major-label grind to explore his music and politics. He returned the following year as an organizer and cultural worker tied to the rising movements against the death penalty, the prison-industrial complex and corporate globalization, voicing his observations through his music.      _Stay Human_ was released in 2000 on his own indie label, Boo Boo Wax and Six Degrees
