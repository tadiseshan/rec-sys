**Method Man** (born Clifford Smith, April 1, 1971 in Hempstead, Long Island, New York) is an American [rapper](http://www.last.fm/tag/rapper) and member of the [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) collective, [Wu-Tang Clan](http://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan). He is also well-known for his work both as a solo artist and with frequent collaborator [Redman](http://www.last.fm/music/Redman), as well as for recent forays into acting.      Method Man spent a childhood split between separated parents in Long Island and Staten Island, and in an apparent precursor to his career in hip hop was introduced both to playing drums and to [poetry](http://www.last.fm/tag/poetry) by his father. Not only was Method interested in music, he was also fascinated by comic books and particularly [Ghost Rider](http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/ghostrider/), a fascination which manifested itself years later in several of his many rap aliases. His pre-hip hop adult life was mostly split between drug dealing and low-paid jobs (including a stint working at the Statue of Liberty, along with future Wu-Tang colleague [U-God](http://www.last.fm/music/U-God)). After becoming well known on the streets for his rhyming abilities, he joined with 8 friends to form the Wu-Tang Clan in the early 1992.      Since the Wu-Tang Clan’s ascendancy to hip hop stardom, Method Man has always been one of the most visible members of the collective. He was one of only two of the group to get a solo song on the group’s debut album _Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers_ and he was the first to release a solo album under the Clan’s unusual contract which allows its members to release albums under any record label (Method chose to sign with legendary rap label [Def Jam](http://www6.defjam.com/site/home.php)). Method Man’s solo debut, _Tical_ (1994) was critically acclaimed and extremely popular, entering the American charts at #4 and eventually selling in excess of one million copies.      He soon collaborated with [Mary J. Blige](http://www.last.fm/music/Mary+J.+Blige) and Redman with a series of hit singles, one of which (the Blige duet “I’ll Be There For You/You’re All I Need To Get By”) won a Grammy, before recording the second Wu-Tang album, _Wu-Tang Forever_.      His second solo album was _Tical 2000: Judgement Day_ (1998), which was heavily influenced by the apocalypse theories surrounding the forthcoming end of the millennium, and which featured a vast amount of guest appearances, from his fellow Clansmen to [Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+%22Left+Eye%22+Lopes), [D’Angelo](http://www.last.fm/music/D%27Angelo), [Chris Rock](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Rock), [Mobb Deep](http://www.last.fm/music/Mobb+Deep), Redman and even Donald Trump. The album sold even better than his first, though reviews were mixed and its long running time and the abundance of between-song comedy skits were criticised by many.      Method Man then toured with [Jay-Z](http://www.last
