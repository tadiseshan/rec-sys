He graduated from St. Mark’s School of Texas in Dallas in 1989.

Miller and Hammond then formed the group [Sleepy Heroes](http://www.last.fm/music/Sleepy+Heroes), a power-pop trio that released one CD - _Under A Radio Sun_ \- and promptly disbanded.      In the early 1990s, Miller started performing country songs acoustically with Hammond with the moniker Ranchero Brothers - a duo that performs occasionally to this day.
