Samuel Carthorne Rivers (September 25, 1923 – December 26, 2011), was an American jazz musician and composer. He performed on soprano and tenor saxophones, bass clarinet, flute, harmonica and piano.      Rivers was born in Enid, Oklahoma. Active in jazz since the early 1950s, he earned wider attention during the mid-1960s spread of free jazz. With a thorough command of music theory, orchestration and composition, Rivers was an influential and prominent artist in jazz music.      Rivers’s father was a gospel musician who had sung with the [Fisk Jubilee Singers](http://www.last.fm/music/Fisk+Jubilee+Singers) and the Silverstone Quartet, exposing Rivers to music from an early age. Rivers moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1947, where he studied at the Boston Conservatory with [Alan Hovhaness](http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Hovhaness).      He performed with [Quincy Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Quincy+Jones), [Herb Pomeroy](http://www.last.fm/music/Herb+Pomeroy), [Tadd Dameron](http://www.last.fm/music/Tadd+Dameron) and others.      In 1959 Rivers began performing with 13-year-old drummer [Tony Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Williams), who later went on to have an impressive career. Rivers was briefly a member of the [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis)’s quintet in 1964, partly at Williams’s recommendation. This quintet was recorded a single album, Miles in Tokyo. However, Rivers’ playing style was too free to be compatible with Davis’s music at this point, and he was soon replaced by [Wayne Shorter](http://www.last.fm/music/Wayne+Shorter). Rivers was signed by Blue Note Records, for whom he recorded four albums as leader and made several sideman appearances. Among noted sidemen on his own Blue Note albums were [Jaki Byard](http://www.last.fm/music/Jaki+Byard) who appears on Fuchsia Swing Song, [Herbie Hancock](http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock) and [Freddie Hubbard](http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Hubbard). He appeared on Blue Note recordings of Tony Williams, [Andrew Hill](http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Hill) and [Larry Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Larry+Young).      Rivers’s music is rooted in bebop, but he is an adventurous player, adept at free jazz. The first of his Blue Note albums, Fuchsia Swing Song, is widely regarded as a masterpiece of an approach sometimes called “inside-outside”. With this approach the performer frequently obliterates the explicit harmonic framework (“going outside”) but retains a hidden link so as to be able to return to it in a seamless fashion. Rivers brought the conceptual tools of bebop harmony to a new level in this process, united at all times with the ability to “tell a story” which [Lester Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Lester+Young) had laid down as a benchmark for the jazz improviser.      His powers as a composer were also in evidence in this period: the ballad “Beatrice” from Fuchsia Swing Song has become an important standard, particularly for tenor saxophonists
