Robert Wyatt, born Robert Ellidge, in Bristol, UK on 28 January 1945, is an English musician, and a former member of the influential Canterbury scene band [Soft Machine](http://www.last.fm/music/Soft+Machine).      As a teenager, he lived with his parents in a fourteen-room Georgian guest- house, Wellington House, in Lydden near Canterbury. Here he was taught the drums by visiting American [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) drummer George Niedorf.      In 1962, Wyatt and Niedorf moved to Majorca where they stayed with the poet Robert Graves. The following year, Wyatt returned to England and joined the [Daevid Allen Trio](http://www.last.fm/music/Daevid+Allen+Trio) with [Daevid Allen](http://www.last.fm/music/Daevid+Allen) and [Hugh Hopper](http://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Hopper). Allen subsequently left for France, and Wyatt and Hopper formed the [Wilde Flowers](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Wilde+Flowers) with [Richard Sinclair](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Sinclair), [Kevin Ayers](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Ayers) and [Brian Hopper](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Hopper). Wyatt was initially the drummer in the Wilde Flowers, but following the departure of Ayers, he became lead singer.      In 1966, the Wilde Flowers disintegrated, and Wyatt and Mike Ratledge formed the Soft Machine with Ayers and Allen. Here Wyatt both drummed and sang, an unusual combination for a stage rock band.      In 1970, after chaotic touring, three albums and increasing internal conflicts in Soft Machine, Wyatt released his first solo album, _The End of an Ear_, which combined his vocal and multi-instrumental talents with tape effects.      A year later, Wyatt left Soft Machine and formed his own band [Matching Mole](http://www.last.fm/music/Matching+Mole) (a pun on “machine molle”, the French for Soft Machine), a largely instrumental outfit. After two albums and a split, Matching Mole were about to embark on a third record when, on 1 June 1973, during a drunken party, Wyatt fell from a third floor window. He was subsequently paralysed from the waist down (paraplegia) and confined to a wheelchair.      The injury led Wyatt to abandon the Matching Mole project, and his drumming. He promptly embarked on a solo-career, and with a collective of session musicians (including [Mike Oldfield](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Oldfield), the poet [Ivor Cutler](http://www.last.fm/music/Ivor+Cutler) and [Henry Cow](http://www.last.fm/music/Henry+Cow) guitarist [Fred Frith](http://www.last.fm/music/Fred+Frith)), he released his acclaimed solo album _Rock Bottom_. Later that same year he put out a single, a cover version of “I’m a Believer”, which hit number 29 in the UK chart. There were strong arguments with the producer of _Top of the Pops_ surrounding his performance of “I’m a Believer,” on the grounds that his wheelchair-bound appearance ‘was not suitable for family viewing’, the producer wanting Wyatt to appear on a normal chair
