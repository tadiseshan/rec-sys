[Lucie Silvas](http://www.last.fm/music/Lucie+Silvas) born 4 September 1977 in Kingston-Upon-Thames, London is a singer/songwriter from the [United Kingdom](http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom).      Born Lucie Joanne Silverman. Lucie left school in the sixth form, where she became a backing vocalist for ex-Take That vocalist [Gary Barlow](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Barlow) and singer [Judie Tzuke](http://www.last.fm/music/Judie+Tzuke). In 2000 Lucie Silvas recorded her album “Forget Me Not” - with tracks including the single “It’s Too Late”. This song entered the charts with a low position, and Lucie was subsequently dropped from her record label.      She then went on to write songs for other artists including [Will Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Young), [Gareth Gates](http://www.last.fm/music/Gareth+Gates), [Rachel Stevens](http://www.last.fm/music/Rachel+Stevens) and [Liberty X](http://www.last.fm/music/Liberty+X).      In 2003, Lucie was signed to Mercury Records, and given a long time to write her debut album, [Breathe In](http://www.last.fm/music/Lucie+Silvas/Breathe+In). The first single from this album, [What You’re Made Of](http://www.last.fm/music/Lucie+Silvas/_/What+You%27re+Made+Of) entered the charts at number 7, and a few weeks later the album entered the charts at number 11 (the highest chart position it has gained, although it has returned to this position on multiple occasions). Following TV appearances on the Ivor Novello Elton John tribute show, and All Time Greatest Love Songs with [Ronan Keating](http://www.last.fm/music/Ronan+Keating), Lucie Silvas released her second single from the album, [Breathe In](http://www.last.fm/music/Lucie+Silvas/_/Breathe+In), which debuted at number 6. Lucie then released power-ballad [The Game Is Won](http://www.last.fm/music/Lucie+Silvas/_/The+Game+Is+Won) and the rock- esque [Don’t Look Back](http://www.last.fm/music/Lucie+Silvas/_/Don%27t+Look+Back) which entered the charts at numbers 38 and 34 respectively. However, the last single from her album, a self-penned ballad entitled [Forget Me Not](http://www.last.fm/music/Lucie+Silvas/_/Forget+Me+Not), entered the UK charts at a low #76.      Having been in the business for almost a year, Lucie has a UK tour, a platinum album and 4 top 40 singles already under her belt. On November 2nd 2005 Lucie embarked upon her next tour, starting in Brighton and has already written her much anticipated follow up album in 2005. Lucie has also been collaborating with the critically acclaimed songwriter Eg White, with whom she wrote the [Will Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Young) single [Who Am I](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Young/_/Who+Am+I).      Lucie’s second album The Same Side was recorded in late 2006. It was released in October 2006 in the Netherlands and in March 2007 in the UK and the rest of Europe
