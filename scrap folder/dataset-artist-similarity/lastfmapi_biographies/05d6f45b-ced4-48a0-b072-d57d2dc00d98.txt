Cory Lee (born in Vancouver, British Columbia) is a Canadian pop singer/songwriter of Chinese and German descent. Her debut album was released in Canada on July 26, 2005 by Sextant Records.      In 2006, her debut USA single, “The Naughty Song” was included on the Season 3 soundtrack of the hit Showtime TV show, “The L Word,” as well as featuring in episode 5 of the show, during a scene where Sarah Shahi’s character, Carmen, is DJing at a party. The song has garnered much attention because of its frank talk about wild sex associated with the club scene.      In January 2006, Cory Lee was nominated for a Juno Award for best R&B/soul recording of the year. Cory will play the character of “Karma” on the third season of Instant Star.
