Justin Townes Earle, born January 4, 1982 in Nashville, TN, is an American alt-country singer-songwriter who walks the line between old-time country and modern acoustic Indie music by breathing new life into early country, blues and gospel forms.      His first release, Yuma, in 2007 was a stark and beautiful set of songs written while Earle was fresh out of rehab and is now re-released by Bloodshot Records, who have a further three albums on their catalogue.      The Good Life, Midnight At the Movies (Americana award nominee) and the latest Harlem River Blues show Earle’s characteristic charm, wit and rhythm to the forefront.      2009 saw him touring with Old Crow Medicine Show, The Felice Brothers and Gillian Welch/Dave Rawlings as a member of The Big Surprise tour and he has been touring solidly through 2010 making fans all along the way. In 2011, he received the Americana Music Award in the Song of the Year category for his “Harlem River Blues,” from the album of the same name.      His fourth release “Nothing’s Gonna Change the Way You Feel About Me Now”, released in 2012 was met with critical acclaim, it was listed at #37 on Rolling Stone’s list of the top 50 albums of 2012, saying “The son of country- rock renegade Steve Earle has grown into a songwriter to rival his dad.”      He is the son of alt-country artist Steve Earle.
