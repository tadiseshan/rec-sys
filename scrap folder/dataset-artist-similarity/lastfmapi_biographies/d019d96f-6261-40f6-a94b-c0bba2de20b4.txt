Burro Banton (born Donovan Spalding, December 27, 1956, Kingston, Jamaica) is a dancehall reggae deejay popular in the 1980s and 1990s.      He is most famous for his anthem “Boom Wah Dis,” which has been recorded many times over the years, most popularly on the Steelie and Clevie riddim called Street Sweeper.      Burro emerged during the early 1980s on [Killamanjaro](http://www.last.fm/music/Killamanjaro) and other sound systems such as [Volcano](http://www.last.fm/music/Volcano), Arrows, and Aces International. His fame rose after his lyrics caused Killamanjaro to “kill” the Volcano sound system of label-owner Henry “Junjo” Lawles in a popular sound clash in 1984.   Burro remained popular during the mid-80s at the beginning of the digital dancehall craze started by King Jammy that also featured artists like [Cutty Ranks](http://www.last.fm/music/Cutty+Ranks). He is known for his very aggressive style; deep, gruff voice; and was the inspiration for many modern dancehall artists like [Buju Banton](http://www.last.fm/music/Buju+Banton), [Bounty Killer](http://www.last.fm/music/Bounty+Killer), and [Elephant Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Elephant+Man).   Burro is one of the few deejays of his generation to voice on newer riddims and be sought out by modern producers for recordings on a regular basis.
