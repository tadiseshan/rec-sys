Daughter of [Loudon Wainwright III](http://www.last.fm/music/Loudon+Wainwright+III) and [Kate McGarrigle](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+McGarrigle), and the sister of [Rufus Wainwright](http://www.last.fm/music/Rufus+Wainwright), she has frequently appeared on recordings by her family members, the [McGarrigle Sisters and Family](http://www.last.fm/music/McGarrigle+Sisters+and+Family) and has released several independent EPs. Wainwright released an independent cassette, Ground Floor, in 1997. The following year, her song “Year of the Dragon” appeared on [The McGarrigle Hour](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+&+Anna+McGarrigle/The+McGarrigle+Hour), an album released by [Kate & Anna McGarrigle](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+&+Anna+McGarrigle). Shortly after this recording, Martha began singing backup vocals for her brother, and released the six-song EP Martha Wainwright in 1999.      Her full length self-titled first album was released in 2005, followed in 2008 by _I Know You’re Married but I’ve Got Feelings Too_, and in 2009 by _Sans fusils, ni souliers, à Paris: Martha Wainwright’s Piaf Record_. The [Prosperpina Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=27263) reports that her 4th album, _Come Home To Mama_, was recorded at Sean Lennon’s studio in New York City. Speaking about the album, Wainwright said: “This record is a culmination of my life experiences so far. Everything changed for me a couple of years ago and this record is a representation of that and a return to the reason I started writing songs.”
