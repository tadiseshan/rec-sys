**Panjabi MC** is a pseudonym of **[Rajinder Rai](http://www.last.fm/music/Rajinder+Rai)** (b. 1971, Coventry, UK), who was discovered by [Nachural](http://www.last.fm/label/Nachural)’s **[Ninder Johal](http://www.last.fm/music/Ninder+Johal)**, thanks to his remix of [Kuldip Manak](http://www.last.fm/music/Kuldip+Manak)’s “Ghariah Milan De”. His first 12” “[Rootz](http://www.last.fm/music/Panjabi+MC/Rootz)” was very controversial because PMC used a religious Muslim song in it. The 12” was taken off the market; but PMC continued making records. “[Mundian to Bach Ke](http://www.last.fm/music/Panjabi+MC/_/Mundian+to+Bach+Ke)” (“Beware of the Boys”) (1998; first appeared on the CD [Legalised](http://www.last.fm/music/Panjabi+MC/Legalised)) which mixed the theme of the TV series Knight Rider (already used before by [Timbaland](http://www.last.fm/music/Timbaland) & [Magoo](http://www.last.fm/music/Magoo)) with [bhangra](http://www.last.fm/tag/bhangra) was already an underground hit when German record company [Superstar Recordings](http://www.last.fm/label/Superstar+Recordings) \- thanks to downloads on the Internet - picked it up and it became a major hit in Germany and then in the rest of Europe, including the UK.
