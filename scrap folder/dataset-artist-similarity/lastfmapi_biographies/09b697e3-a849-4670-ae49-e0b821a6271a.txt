**Randy Travis** (born Randy Bruce Traywick, May 4, 1959 in Marshville, North Carolina) is an American multiple Grammy Award and Dove Award-winning American country singer. Active since 1985, he has recorded more than a dozen studio albums to date, in addition to charting more than thirty singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts.      Travis was born in Marshville, North Carolina, the second of six children of Bobbie, a textile factory worker, and Harold Traywick, a horse breeder, turkey farmer, and construction business owner. While growing up, Travis was forced to take guitar lessons by his father and began performing at the age of eight with his brother, Ricky. Travis began drinking at the age of 12, and by 14 was a regular marijuana user, who occasionally dabbled in harder drugs. He often fought with his father and soon dropped out of high school. He became a juvenile delinquent and was arrested for various offenses, including auto theft and burglary.      Harold Traywick entered Randy and Ricky in a talent contest at a nightclub called “Country City, USA” in Charlotte, North Carolina. In the meantime, Ricky, who also had brushes with the law, was sentenced to jail and Randy had to complete the contest alone, but he won anyway. The club’s manager, Elizabeth “Lib” Hatcher, took an interest in Travis and gave him a job singing at the club. Travis began focusing on music. He first recorded for Paula Records and released two unsuccessful singles — “She’s My Woman” and “Dreamin’”. Travis’ legal troubles continued and he was due in court for probation violations. Hatcher pleaded with the judge and Travis was released in her custody with the warning that if the judge ever saw him again “he’d better bring his toothbrush, because he would be going to jail for a very long time.”      Travis moved in with Hatcher. This put further strain on her already fragile marriage. She eventually left her husband and, in 1982, she and Travis moved to Nashville, Tennessee. Travis was soon turned down by every record label in town. His early demo tapes were criticized by Nashville record executives as being “too country.” Hatcher took a job as manager of a nightclub, “The Nashville Palace” and hired Travis as a cook and singer. It was during this time that an unlikely romance began to form between the two; Travis said “I think we discovered how much we needed each other.”      **Career**      In 1982, Travis recorded an independent album Randy Ray Live and Lib Hatcher used it to secure a deal with Warner Bros. Records. However, the label said they had to keep their romance a secret, so as not to turn away fans, and changed his stage name from Randy Ray to Randy Travis. In 1985, Warner Brothers released Travis’ single, “On the Other Hand,” which topped out at 67 on the country charts. His next single, “1982”, became a Top 10 hit followed by the re-release of “On the Other Hand” in 1986. The re-release became Travis’ first number one hit
