**Carole King** (born February 9, 1942) is an American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) and pianist, regarded as one of the most influential female songwriters of the 20th century. One half of a legendary songwriting partnership together with her one-time husband, [Gerry Goffin](http://www.last.fm/music/Gerry+Goffin), she wrote several hit songs in the ‘[60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s) hits for artists such as [The Shirelles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Shirelles) (“[Will You Love Me Tomorrow](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Shirelles/_/Will+You+Love+Me+Tomorrow)”), [Aretha Franklin](http://www.last.fm/music/Aretha+Franklin) (“[(You Make Me Feel Like) a Natural Woman](http://www.last.fm/music/Aretha+Franklin/_/\(You+Make+Me+Feel+Like\)+a+Natural+Woman)”), and [The Monkees](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Monkees) (“[Pleasant Valley Sunday](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Monkees/_/Pleasant+Valley+Sunday)”). At the dawn of the ‘[70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s), she released the solo album _[Tapestry](http://www.last.fm/music/Carole+King/Tapestry)_, a critically and financially successful landmark in the singer-songwriter genre.      Born Carol Klein in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish household, King started out playing the piano, then moved on to singing, forming a vocal quartet called the Co-Sines at James Madison High School. She attended Queens College, where she was a classmate of [Neil Sedaka](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Sedaka) and inspired Sedaka’s first big hit, “[Oh! Carol](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Sedaka/_/Oh!+Carol)”, to which she later wrote and recorded a tongue-in-cheek response, “[Oh! Neil](http://www.last.fm/music/Carole+King/_/Oh!+Neil)”. Along with Sedaka and [Gerry Goffin](http://www.last.fm/music/Gerry+Goffin) (whom she later married), King also befriended [Paul Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon) at the same college.      Goffin and King soon formed a songwriting partnership, eventually married, and had two daughters, [Louise Goffin](http://www.last.fm/music/Louise+Goffin) and [Sherry Goffin Kondor](http://www.last.fm/music/Sherry+Goffin+Kondor), both of whom have also become singers. Working for Aldon Music in the Brill Building in the heart of New York’s music district, where chart-topping hits were churned out during the 1960s, the Goffin-King partnership first hit it big with “[Will You Love Me Tomorrow](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Shirelles/_/Wil l+You+Love+Me+Tomorrow)”. Recorded by [The Shirelles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Shirelles), the song topped the charts in 1961. It was later covered by [Dusty Springfield](http://www.last.fm/music/Dusty+Springfield), [Little Eva](http://www.last.fm/music/Little+Eva), [Roberta Flack](http://www.last.fm/music/Roberta+Flack), [Laura Branigan](http://www.last.fm/music/Laura+Branigan), [The Four Seasons](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Four+Seasons), and King herself.      In 1962, Goffin and King co-wrote “[Up on the Roof](http://www.last
