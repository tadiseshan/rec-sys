**John Scofield** (born December 26, 1951 in Dayton, Ohio, USA) is a [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) guitarist and composer, who played and eventually collaborated with [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis). A [bebop](http://www.last.fm/tag/bebop) master, Scofield is simultaneously well acquainted with R&B and [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) styles which he mixes seamlessly with his jazz playing.      He recorded with [Charles Mingus](http://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Mingus) in 1976, and replaced [Pat Metheny](http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Metheny) in [Gary Burton](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Burton)’s quartet. In autumn 1976 he signed a contract with Enja Records, and he released his first album _East Meets West_ in 1977. In 1979 he formed a trio with [Steve Swallow](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Swallow) and [Adam Nussbaum](http://www.last.fm/music/Adam+Nussbaum). He later joined [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis), with whom he remained until 1985.      While still with Davis, he released _Electric Outlet_ (1984). _Still Warm_ (1985) followed after he left Davis’s group.      At the beginning of the 1990s, he formed a quartet with [Joe Lovano](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Lovano) with whom he recorded several important albums for Blue Note Records. _Time on My Hands_ (1990), with Lovano, [Charlie Haden](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Haden) and [Jack DeJohnette](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+DeJohnette), showcased Scofield’s guitar and Mingus-influenced writing. [Bill Stewart](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Stewart) subsequently became the group’s drummer, and played on _Meant to Be_ (1991) and _What We Do_ (1993). In 1992, Scofield released _Grace Under Pressure_, featuring fellow guitarist [Bill Frisell](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Frisell), with [Charlie Haden](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Haden) on bass and [Joey Baron](http://www.last.fm/music/Joey+Baron) on drums. Stewart was back in the drum chair for the 1994 collaboration with [Pat Metheny](http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Metheny), _I Can See Your House from Here_. Also, in 1997 he recorded “A Go Go” LP, supported by the fame of [Medeski, Martin and Wood](http://www.last.fm/music/Medeski,+Martin+and+Wood), truly a masterpiece with range of lounge music and finest funk feel behind the beat.      Towards the end of his tenure with Blue Note, Scofield returned to a more funk- and soul jazz-oriented sound, a direction which has dominated much of his subsequent output. At this time, he also started performing with various jambands, and even performed with [DJ Logic](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Logic) to cover [Phish](http://www.last.fm/music/Phish)’s “Cars Trucks Buses”, on _Sharin’ in the Groove_ (2001).      He released _Überjam_ in 2002 and _Up All Night_ in 2004, two albums on which he experiments with drum n bass and other modern rhythms
