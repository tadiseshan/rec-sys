Freak Kitchen is a [heavy metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/heavy%20metal)/[hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock) band from Gothenburg, Sweden, formed in 1992. The high technical level of their compositions usually makes people refer to their style as somewhat of a [progressive metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20metal) or [progressive rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20rock) band.      Freak Kitchen’s style of music is influenced by many genres besides the traditional heavy metal, ranging from [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) to [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop). The band described their third album as “A corny little heavy-pop-rock-latin-world-jazz-avant-garde-metal-blues-record”.      Lyrics contain heavy criticism against capitalist society, conformity, racism and the attitude of huge record companies.      Frontman [Mattias IA Eklundh](http://www.last.fm/music/Mattias+IA+Eklundh) is widely known as a guitarist of high technical ability, and live shows often contain parts where Eklundh plays the guitar using several foreign objects such as a vibrating dildo. Eklundh has also released three solo albums, [Sensually Primitive](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Libido/Sensually+Primitive) (1997) (under the pseudonym [Mr. Libido](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Libido)), [Freak Guitar](http://www.last.fm/music/Mattias+IA+Eklundh/Freak+Guitar) (1999) and [The Road Less Traveled](http://www.last.fm/music/Mattias+IA+Eklundh/The+Road+Less+Traveled) (2004).
