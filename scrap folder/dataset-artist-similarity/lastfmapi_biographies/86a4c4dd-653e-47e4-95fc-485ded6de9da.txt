Leela James is a Los Angeles native and soul singer who cites [James Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown), [Roberta Flack](http://www.last.fm/music/Roberta+Flack), and [Gladys Knight](http://www.last.fm/music/Gladys+Knight), among others, as influences. Her deep, rich and gritty vocals easily draw comparisons to [Aretha Franklin](http://www.last.fm/music/Aretha+Franklin) and Gladys Knight.      In 2004, James toured as an opening act for the [Black Eyed Peas](http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Eyed+Peas) and [Macy Gray](http://www.last.fm/music/Macy+Gray). That same year, she was featured on hip hop producer, DJ, and emcee [Pete Rock](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Rock)’s album Soul Survivor II, providing vocals to the track “No Tears”.      Her debut album was released on June 21, 2005, entitled _A Change Is Gonna Come_. The album is a soul music record incorporating the styles of 1960s and 1970s American soul singers, with a mixture of funk, R&B and gospel influences. The first single from the album, entitled “Music,” laments what Leela James sees as the decline of hip hop and soul music and asks for a return to the artistry of musicians of earlier decades. Leela co-wrote most of the tracks on her debut album, with two notable exceptions being her cover of [No Doubt](http://www.last.fm/music/No+Doubt)’s “Don’t Speak,” and the classic song by [Sam Cooke](http://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Cooke) for which the album is named. Notable collaborators on the album include [Raphael Saadiq](http://www.last.fm/music/Raphael+Saadiq) of the 1990s R&B group [Tony! Toni! Toné!](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Tony!+Toni!+Ton%C3%A9!), [Kanye West](http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West), and former [Fugees](http://www.last.fm/music/Fugees) member [Wyclef Jean](http://www.last.fm/music/Wyclef+Jean).      After parting ways with Warner Bros., James signed with the independent label Shanachie Records and released her second studio album on March 24, 2009, an all-cover set entitled _Let’s Do It Again_ (the title being a homage to the 1975 soundtrack album of the same name by [The Staple Singers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Staple+Singers)).      In 2005, she lent her voice to the posthumously released [Ray Charles](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles) album Genius & Friends, duetting with the singer on the song “Compared to What”. Leela also guested on [Robert Randolph and the Family Band](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Rob ert+Randolph+and+the+Family+Band)’s 2006 album Colorblind, lending her vocals to “Stronger”. In June 2009, she appeared on [Moby](http://www.last.fm/music/Moby)’s new album “Wait for Me”, performing the vocal on “Walk with Me”.
