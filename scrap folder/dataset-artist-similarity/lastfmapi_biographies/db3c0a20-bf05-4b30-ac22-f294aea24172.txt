Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.      Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the [young snakes](http://www.last.fm/music/young+snakes); the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to “sweetness and melody”, she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band [’Til Tuesday](http://www.last.fm/music/%27Til+Tuesday), which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann’s breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann’s signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song “Time Stand Still” (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, ‘Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything’s Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician [Jon Brion](http://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Brion) joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.      Around the time of the first album’s release, Mann began a romantic relationship with [Jules Shear](http://www.last.fm/music/Jules+Shear); they broke up before the final ‘Til Tuesday album, which contained the song “J For Jules”. Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann’s manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.      **Solo career**   In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995’s I’m with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.      Mann had met musician [Michael Penn](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Penn) in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.      Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since “Voices Carry” — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson’s Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, “Save Me”
