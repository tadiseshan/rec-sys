Laura Marling (born 1st February 1990) is a [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) singer/songwriter/guitarist from Eversley, United Kingdom.      She began playing the guitar at the age of five, first being taught the blues by her father in front of the family fire, and has been enthralled by the songs and lyrics of the likes of [Neil Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young), [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan), [James Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Taylor) and [John Mayall](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Mayall) ever since. It’s not just the “golden-oldies” that Laura admires; she also harbours a rather deep love for alt.country’s favourite son, [Ryan Adams](http://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Adams). “He’s brilliant, there’s nothing that even comes close, he can paint the most amazing pictures in your mind.” Ryan Adams in turn had her album ‘I Speak Because I Can’ given to him by a producer friend. Ryan had written a lot of the material for his forthcoming album ‘Ashes and Fire’ but upon listening to her album he said; “I actually threw out the record I was writing and re-wrote my record based on that album because I thought to myself somebody’s actually taking this very seriously … It was amazing, a great motivation … And it felt good to ask: ‘What am I really capable of? I felt competitive again to write great songs.”      [Jamie T](http://www.last.fm/music/Jamie+T) personally invited her on tour with him after being impressed by her modern folk-pop when he caught her playing just her second ever gig. Marling is part of the extended [Way Out West](http://www.last.fm/label/Way+Out+West) family, having played five eminent shows at the label’s Brentford FC night before the club was finally moved on, and was also a member of [Noah and the Whale](http://www.last.fm/music/Noah+and+the+Whale) until May 2008, contributing vocals and instruments throughout, and seen in the “[Five Years Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Noah+and+the+Whale/_/Five+Years+Time)” video playing recorder.      Following her London Town EP, Marling’s debut album Alas I Cannot Swim was released by Virgin on 4th February 2008. Originally released in a large Song Box containing mementos and trinkets personal to the songs, as well as a concert ticket., the album was nominated for the 2008 Mercury Music Prize.      Marling released her second album, I Speak Because I Can, on March 22nd 2010.      The first track from her third album, A Creature I Don’t Know, to receive radio airplay was “Sophia.” The song is an ode to a mythical deity.
