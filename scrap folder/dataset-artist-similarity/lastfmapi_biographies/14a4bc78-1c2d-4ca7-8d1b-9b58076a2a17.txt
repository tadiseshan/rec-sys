Geoffrey Arnold “Jeff” Beck (born 24 June 1944) is an English rock [guitarist](http://www.last.fm/tag/guitarist). [Jeff Beck](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Beck) was one of the three noted guitarists, the others being [Eric Clapton](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton) and [Jimmy Page](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Page), to have played with **The Yardbirds**. Beck was ranked 5th in Rolling Stone Magazine’s list of the “100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time”.      Beck burst onto the music scene in 1966 after joining **The Yardbirds**. Although his stint with the band lasted only 18 months, Beck played on almost all of the group’s hits. More importantly, Beck’s innovative style heard on classics released as singles like “Shapes of Things” and “Heart Full of Soul” helped influence the psychedelic sound of the ‘60s. “Heart Full of Soul” was later released as a track on [Having A Rave Up](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Yardbirds/Having+A+Rave+Up).      At the height of the Yardbirds’ popularity in 1967, Beck left the group and embarked upon an unpredictable journey of musical discovery that has lasted nearly four-decades as an Epic recording artist. During that time, Beck has left his distinctive mark on [hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock), [jazz-fusion](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz-fusion) and modern music history.      While many of his contemporaries are satisfied with musical inertia, Beck continues to add to his legacy as an innovator with the release of his 14th album, simply titled “[Jeff](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Beck/Jeff) .” Produced by [Andy Wright](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Wright) (Simply Red, Eurythmics) and mixed by [Mike Barbiero](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Barbiero) (Blues Traveler, Metallica), the 13 songs on “Jeff” reflect how Beck’s fascination with electronic music continues to evolve.      “On my last album, ‘[You Had It Coming](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Beck/You+Had+It+Coming),’ I spent a lot of time in the studio with Andy Wright just toying around with different sounds. We had a great time, but I bogged down in the possibilities,” says Beck, who earned a Grammy for instrumental performance for the song “Dirty Mind” from that album. “When I went back to the studio for ‘Jeff ,’ I didn’t want to get bogged down again so I brought in a few people to help push us along.”      Although they only met when the album was almost finished, Beck says David Torn of the New York trip-hop group Splattercell became an important collaborator. Much to Beck’s delight, Torn gutted an early version of the song, “Plan B.” “Dave ripped the vocals out straight away and made my guitar line the song’s main hook. That’s what I should have done in the first place, but it takes a remix guy to come along and put a different spin on what you’re doing,” he says. “The instant I heard Dave’s album with Splattercell, I wanted him to dismember one of my songs, and he came through beautifully
