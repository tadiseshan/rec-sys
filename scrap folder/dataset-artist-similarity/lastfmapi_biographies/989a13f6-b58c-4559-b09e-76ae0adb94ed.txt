**Allison Crowe** (born 16 November 1981) is a singer-songwriter, guitarist and pianist from Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada who now lives in Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Canada.      Allison Crowe began performing professionally in 1996, at age 15, doing regular sets in the coffee-houses and bars of Vancouver Island.      “I love singing for people,” says Crowe. “It’s a way to connect and share with others. Communication is crucial. Just being able to do what I do, to write and sing and perform, makes me feel not only alive, but incredibly lucky. Knowing at any moment everything could change, I don’t take one second for granted.”      Today, at 33 years, Crowe’s reach is global. The audience for her music videos and song downloads numbers more millions each year.      “Allison Crowe has a voice to fall in love with,” says UK music industry journal Record of the Day. “She is from Vancouver Island in Canada, descended from Scottish, Irish and Manx stock. She’s exactly the sort of artist who can make serious headway on her own label and that’s just what she’s doing.”      With Ani DiFranco as a model of integrity, and Creative Commons licensing changing the “game” for musicians of a new era, Crowe created her own label.
