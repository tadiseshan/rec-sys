Biagio Antonacci (born 9 November 1963) is an Italian singer-songwriter, from Milan.      Biagio Antonacci was born in Milan and was raised in one of its suburbs (Rozzano). Despite learning how to play the drums at a young age, he had to study in order to obtain a diploma in surveying. He participated in the 38th Sanremo Music Festival in 1988 with the song Voglio vivere in un attimo. He was first signed to a record company in 1989, with his debut album Sono cose che capitano which went unnoticed thanks to the song Fiore. His second album, Adagio Biagio, was released two years later. He slowly rose to recognition due to his two songs Danza sul mio petto and Per√≤ ti amo receiving airtime on the radio. He has two sons with Marianna Morandi, daughter of the Italian singer and actor Gianni Morandi.
