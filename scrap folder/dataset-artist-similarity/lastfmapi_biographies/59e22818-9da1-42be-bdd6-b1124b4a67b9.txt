   Aaron Tippin (born July 3, 1958) is a country music singer.      Born in Pensacola, Florida, but raised in upstate South Carolina, Tippin performed in local honky-tonks in the 1970s. He competed on TNN’s “You Can Be A Star” talent contest in 1986, landed a song publishing contract and moved to Nashville in 1987. During this time he wrote songs for The Kingsmen, David Ball, The Midsouth Boys, Mark Collie, and Charlie Pride. He would spend his nights working at a mill in Kentucky and spend his days driving 60 miles to Nashville to write songs.      Tippin performed his first Nashville nightclub show in 1990, and it earned him a contract with RCA records. His first single, “You’ve Got to Stand for Something”, cracked the top 10 in 1991 and allowed him to go to the Persian Gulf with Bob Hope, to entertain the troops. Then, in 1992, Aaron’s single “There Ain’t Nothin’ Wrong With the Radio” stayed at No. 1 for three weeks.      In 1995, Tippin married Thea Corontzos, and he, Thea, and his manager, Billy Craven, created Tippin’s company, Tip Top Entertainment. Tippin also opened two hunting supply stores called Aaron Tippin Firearms. One is located close to where he lives in Smithville, Tennessee, and the other run by his father in Oak City, North Carolina.      In 1998, Tippin moved to Lyric Street Records and charted a No.1 hit with “Kiss This”, co-written with his wife Thea in 2000. In the wake of 9/11, his patriotic anthem, “Where the Stars and Stripes and Eagle Fly”, peaked at No. 2. Both songs crossed over onto the Hot 100 charts; in fact, “Stars And Stripes” was his biggest crossover hit.      In 2006, Tippin started up his own record label, Nippit Records; the label’s name is “Tippin” spelled backwards.
