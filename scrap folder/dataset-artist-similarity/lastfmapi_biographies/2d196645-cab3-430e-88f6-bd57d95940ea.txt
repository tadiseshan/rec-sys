Oysterhead is a rock supergroup formed in 2000, featuring guitarist [Trey Anastasio](http://www.last.fm/music/Trey+Anastasio) of [Phish](http://www.last.fm/music/Phish), bassist [Les Claypool](http://www.last.fm/music/Les+Claypool) of [Primus](http://www.last.fm/music/Primus), and drummer [Stewart Copeland](http://www.last.fm/music/Stewart+Copeland) of [The Police](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Police).      The style and sound of the band is a unique, somewhat bizarre mix between Anastasio’s jam band style, the bass-oriented [funk metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/funk%20metal) music of Claypool, and the [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae)-influenced beats of Copeland. To many, this is considered to be the bridge between the music of Phish and Primus. After the release of the band’s only album, [The Grand Pecking Order](http://www.last.fm/music/Oysterhead/The+Grand+Pecking+Order) in 2001, the band’s members returned to work of material with their main bands.      On February 10, 2006, it was announced that Oysterhead would be reuniting for one more set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival.
