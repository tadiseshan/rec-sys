**Drive-By Truckers** are an [alternative country](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20country) band which formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1996. Currently, the band consists of [Patterson Hood](http://www.last.fm/music/Patterson+Hood) (vocals, guitar), [Mike Cooley](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Cooley) (vocals, guitar), [David Barbe](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Barbe) (bass), [John Neff](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Neff) (guitar), [Jay Gonzalez](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Gonzalez) (keyboards) and [Brad Morgan](http://www.last.fm/music/Brad+Morgan) (drums). Cooley and Hood are the only original members of the band remaining. Among the band’s former members are [Jason Isbell](http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Isbell) (vocals, guitar) who left the band in 2007, and [Shonna Tucker](http://www.last.fm/music/Shonna+Tucker) (bass, vocals) who left the band in 2011.      Noteworthy for their three guitars lineup, the ‘Truckers’ are often associated with the Southern rock movement of the 70s and “jam” bands but are too cerebral and irreverent to sit squarely in either genre. Their lyrics often revolve around the working class trying to survive in economically-depressed small towns of the South.      Co-founded by Patterson Hood (son of bassist [David Hood](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Hood) of the legendary Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section) and longtime friend and musical partner Mike Cooley in Athens, Georgia, in 1996. The two men had played in various other bands including Adam’s House Cat which was chosen as a top ten Best Unsigned Band by a Musician contest in the late 1980s.      Together with a revolving group of musicians, Drive-By Truckers put out their first two albums, [Gangstabilly](http://www.last.fm/music/Drive- By+Truckers/Gangstabilly) (1998) and [Pizza Deliverance](http://www.last.fm/music/Drive-By+Truckers/Pizza+Deliverance) (1999). Following their second release, the band embarked on a nationwide tour, resulting in a live album called [Alabama Ass Whuppin’](http://www.last.fm/music/Drive-By+Truckers/Alabama+Ass+Whuppin%27) (released in 2000 by Second Heaven Records, re-released in 2002 by Terminus Records). They had an entertaining and informational website long before most bands had begun taking advantage of the internet as a promotional tool, and together with constant touring, they quickly developed a large and dedicated fan base both on and off-line.      After three years on the road a tight-knit group of musicians emerged and they began work on 2001’s [Southern Rock Opera](http://www.last.fm/music/Drive- By+Truckers/Southern+Rock+Opera). Southern Rock Opera is a double album executed as a song cycle. The album loosely uses the rise and literal fall of [Lynyrd Skynyrd](http://www.last.fm/music/Lynyrd+Skynyrd) as a metaphor for the culture of the American South
