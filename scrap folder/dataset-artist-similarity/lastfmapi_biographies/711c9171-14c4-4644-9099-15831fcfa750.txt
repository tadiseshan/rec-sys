Jane Siberry (born October 12, 1955 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is most famous for her early 1980s new wave hits such as ‘Mimi on the Beach’, ‘I Muse Aloud’ and ‘One More Colour’. Internationally, she is best known for her 1993 album ‘When I Was a Boy’. Her first self-titled album was released in 1981.      Following the commercial failure of her 1995 album [Maria](http://www.last.fm/music/Jane+Siberry/Maria) , Siberry founded her own independent label, Sheeba Records. She has released all of her subsequent material on that label. Her public profile has been lower since she became an independent artist; however, she retains a devoted cult following.      Early in 2006, she closed her Sheeba office, then sold and gave away nearly all of her possessions — including her home and instruments. She presently retains one travelling guitar, but none of the other instruments featured on her albums and in her concerts.      On June 3, 2006, somewhere in northwestern Europe, Siberry changed her name to [Issa](http://www.last.fm/music/Issa). She revealed her new name to the public on June 24, 2006. She has also indicated, however, that her older music will remain available for sale under the name Jane Siberry; only her new material will be released as Issa.
