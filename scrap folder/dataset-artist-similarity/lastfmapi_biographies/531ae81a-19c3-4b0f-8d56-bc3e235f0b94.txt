Bo Bice has music in his blood. Born Harold Bice in Huntsville, Alabama on Nov. 1, 1975, Bo was raised in the south by his song-singing, instrument- playing, music-worshiping parents. He competed in the fourth season of American Idol and was the runner-up to Carrie Underwood.      Bo’s first album, titled The Real Thing, was released on December 13th, 2005. It includes several original songs on which Bo shares writing credit such as “It’s My Life”, which Bo wrote with Clif Magness and Kara DioGuardi.      Bo’s second album, “See The Light” was released October 23, 2007. It was recorded in his own studio, and under his own independent record label, Sugar Money (teamed up with StratArt for that project). The album was co-produced by Bo and Frank Liddell. The songs (all written by Bo, some in collaboration with friends) reflect a diverse spectrum—from all-out southern rock, country, funk, to emotional ballads.
