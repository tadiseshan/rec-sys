Owner of a distinctive, harsh voice (even if considering the conspicuous Armstrong mannerisms), Elza Soares is one of the most swinging samba singers, the peak of her success achieved in the late sixties. Soares always had her artistic career complicated by her personal life, which certainly impeded her of enjoying a more widespread popularity.      Soares lived in extreme poverty throughout her childhood and teens. She married at 12 Soares had her first audition in radio at Ary Barroso’s novice show when she was 16, winning first place. She was then hired as a crooner by the Orquestra Garam de Bailes (led by conductor Joaquim Naegli). She worked in the orchestra until 1954, when she became pregnant. In 1955, she was invited to star together with [Grande Otelo](http://www.last.fm/music/Grande+Otelo) in the play Jour-Jou-Fru-Fru, which was a smash.      Three years later, Soares toured Argentina, returning in the next year when she was hired by Rádio Vera Cruz. Also in 1959, she recorded a 78 rpm with “Se Acaso Você Chegasse” (Lupício Rodrigues/[Felisberto Martins](http://www.last.fm/music/Felisberto+Martins)), one of her biggest hits. In 1960, she went to São Paulo where she performed regularly in the show I Festival Nacional de Bossa Nova and recorded her first LP, Se Acaso Você Chegasse.      In 1962, she represented Brazil in Chile during the World Soccer Cup, where she met Garrincha, one of the most genial soccer players ever, and also a chronic alcoholic. With Garrincha, Soares had a very troubled marriage (and the untimely demise of their son Garrinchinha in 1986 in a car accident didn’t help her in any way).      The peak of her career was in the ’60s, with albums like O Máximo em Samba (1967), Elza Soares & [Wilson Das Neves](http://www.last.fm/music/Wilson+Das+Neves) (1968), Elza, Miltinho e Samba (a three-album series shared with [Miltinho](http://www.last.fm/music/Miltinho)). In that decade she had several hits like “Boato,” “Edmundo” (a version of “In the Mood”), “Beija-me,” “Devagar Com a Louça,” “Mulata Assanhada,” “O Mundo Encantado de Monteiro Lobato,” “Bahia de Todos os Deuses,” “Palmas no Portão,” and “Palhaçada.”      Having recorded several albums with the hits “Só Danço Samba” (Tom Jobim/Vinícius de Moraes), “A Banca do Distinto” (Billy Blanco), “Pressentimento” (Elton Medeiros/Hermínio Bello de Carvalho), and “Princesa Isabel” (Sérgio Ricardo), she moved to Italy in 1969, where she performed at the Sistina theater (Rome), returning to Brazil in 1972. In the same year, she opened the show Elza Em Dia de Graça at the Opinião theater (Rio) and participated in the Brasil Export Show (Canecão).      In the ’70s, she still had success with “Salve a Mocidade” (1974), and “Malandro” (1977, this song launched [Jorge Aragão](http://www.last.fm/music/Jorge+Arag%C3%A3o) as a composer)
