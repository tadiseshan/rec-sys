**Jenny Lewis** (born January 8, 1976, in Las Vegas, Nevada) is an indie folk singer/songwriter/guitarist, who is best known for being the lead singer and guitarist for the indie rock band [Rilo Kiley](http://www.last.fm/music/Rilo+Kiley). She has released three solo albums, 2006’s “[Rabbit Fur Coat](http://www.last.fm/music/Jenny+Lewis+with+The+Watson+Twins/Rabbit+Fur+Coat)” (with [The Watson Twins](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Watson+Twins)), 2008’s “[Acid Tongue](http://www.last.fm/music/Jenny+Lewis/Acid+Tongue)” and 2014’s “[The Voyager](http://www.last.fm/music/Jenny+Lewis/The+Voyager)”. She is also a former child actress.      Music      In 1995, she formed the [indie rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rock) band Rilo Kiley along with her friends Pierre De Reeder, Blake Sennett and Dave Rock (later replaced by Jason Boesel). Beginning with a [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) sound, Rilo Kiley gravitated toward a downbeat indie rock sound, and with their 2004 album _More Adventurous_ found widespread success. Critics such as [Pitchforkmedia](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/) attributed this to the “wise” decision to front Lewis on most of the songs (on earlier albums, Sennett contributed about half the vocals). The song “Portions for Foxes” was a hit, and in 2005 the band was picked up by Warner Bros., putting them on a major label for the first time. They opened for [Coldplay](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay) on their [U.S.](http://www.last.fm/place/united%20states) tour in 2005.      In 2002, Lewis was asked to contribute some female vocals for [The Postal Service](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Postal+Service), whose album _Give Up_ was an international success. Lewis performed in the video for the hit “We Will Become Silhouettes”, and toured with the band in 2003. Lewis also contributed vocals to several tracks on the 2004 [Cursive](http://www.last.fm/music/Cursive) album _The Ugly Organ_.      In 2004, [Conor Oberst](http://www.last.fm/music/Conor+Oberst) invited Lewis to record a solo record for record label [Team Love](http://www.team- love.com/headphones/). Described by Lewis as “a kind of [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) record,” _Rabbit Fur Coat_, released in January 2006, features contributions from musicians Conor Oberst of [Bright Eyes](http://www.last.fm/music/Bright+Eyes), [M. Ward](http://www.last.fm/music/M.+Ward), [Maroon 5](http://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5) guitarist [James Valentine](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Valentine), and [Ben Gibbard](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Gibbard) of [Death Cab for Cutie](http://www.last.fm/music/Death+Cab+for+Cutie) on a cover of [The Traveling Wilburys](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Traveling+Wilburys) song “Handle With Care”.
