**Kingston Wall** was a psychedelic/progressive rock group from Helsinki, Finland. They were formed in 1987. Influenced by such artists as [Jimi Hendrix](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix), [Led Zeppelin](http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin) and [Pink Floyd](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd), the group combined eastern themes, mysticism and vivid psychedelia with their unique, hard-edged acid-rock.      Group members were Petri “Pete” Walli (guitar, vocals), Jukka Jylli (bass) and Sami Kuoppamäki (drums, percussion).      During their existence, Kingston Wall released only three self-financed albums on their own label, Trinity. The albums were _Kingston Wall_ (also known as _I_) in 1992, _II_ in 1993 and _Tri-Logy_ in 1994.      The group was disbanded by Petri Walli in December 1994. Walli went travelling to India and Norway. The definite end for Kingston Wall came on June 28th 1995 when Walli jumped to his death from a church tower in Helsinki.      After the band’s demise, the three Kingston Wall albums have been re-issued as double CD’s with bonus tracks by Zen Garden record label (Finland). In 2000, a remix album titled _Freakout Remixes_ was released, which featured trance/techno remixes of Kingston Wall songs by Finnish electronica artists, and in autumn 2005 a 3-disc set titled _Real Live Thing_ was released, which featured live bootlegs from various live shows, available now for the first time ever.
