Born in Manhattan, New York, United States, Apple made her break into the music industry when a friend, who babysat for a record executive, handed her employer a demo. Apple’s husky voice, nimble piano skills, and mature lyrics got the attention of Sony executive Andy Slater, who signed her to a record deal.      In 1996, Apple’s debut album Tidal was released by a subsidiary of [Sony](http://www.last.fm/label/Sony). The album went on to sell 3 million copies (certified triple platinum) domestically.      “[Criminal](http://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple/Criminal),” the third single from Tidal, became Apple’s breakthrough hit. The song garnered a great deal of attention, in part for its suggestive lyrics (“I’ve been a bad, bad girl…”) but also for the controversial music video, directed by Mark Romanek. The video featured a waifish, half-dressed Apple surrounded by the aftermath of a party, including unconscious party-goers. The video received heavy rotation on VH-1 and MTV and gained the singer immediate notoriety. Years later, Apple said, “I wasn’t (comfortable). And you can see that in the video. It’s not sexy. It’s disturbing.”      Other singles from Tidal included “[Sleep to Dream](http://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple/Sleep+to+Dream),” “[Shadowboxer](http://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple/Shadowboxer),” “[Never Is a Promise](http://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple/Never+Is+a+Promise),” and “[The First Taste](http://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple/The+First+Taste).”      In 1998, she contributed two tracks to the _Pleasantville_ soundtrack, “Please Send Me Someone to Love” and a cover of the Beatles hit “Across the Universe”.      In 1999, Apple’s second album was released with the name “_WHEN THE PAWN Hits The Conflicts He Thinks Like A King What He Knows Throws The Blows When He Goes To The Fight And He’ll Win The Whole Thing ‘Fore He Enters The Ring There’s No Body To Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand And Remember That Depth Is The Greatest Of Heights And If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where To Land And If You Fall It won’t Matter ‘Cuz You’ll Know That You’re Right_” but it has just been commonly called “When the Pawn.” This album released the singles “[Fast as You Can](http://www.last
