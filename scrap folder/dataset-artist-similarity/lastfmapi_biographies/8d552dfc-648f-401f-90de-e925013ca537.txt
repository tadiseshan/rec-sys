Lewis’s debut tour, The Labyrinth, started in 2010.      Lewis was born in the London Borough of Islington, to Aural Josiah “Joe” Lewis of Afro-Guyanese descent, and Maria Lewis of Welsh, Italian and Irish descent. Her parents enrolled her at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, and from there she attended the Italia Conti Academy and the BRIT School, where she learned to play instruments such as the guitar and piano, in the hope of becoming a singer-songwriter. Lewis wrote her first full-length song at the age of 12. She initially trained in opera, but went on to singing jazz and blues, eventually leading to popular music, citing Minnie Riperton, Eva Cassidy and Stevie Wonder as her main influences. After leaving the BRIT School at 17, she took a number of jobs to fund studio time, recording a demo album called Twilight. The album, almost exclusively comprising her own compositions, was recorded under Spiral Music, a production company based in Fulham. “I tried to secure a record deal by doing things my own way. I worked very hard but I never managed to land a contract”, said Lewis. Other demos were recorded under licence from UEG Entertainment, later included on an album called Best Kept Secret
