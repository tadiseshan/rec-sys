Marx placed himself in the record books by being the first solo artist to have his first seven singles hit the top 5 on the U.S. top singles charts.      Marx was born to Dick and Ruth Marx. Marx grew up in a mixed faith household where father was Jewish and his mother was a Christian. His father was a jingle writer for commercials for popular products such as ‘Chicken of the Sea’, which is where Marx got his start writing at the tender age of five. His father also was talented [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) musician, well- known in the Chicago area.      At the age of 17, Marx created a demo to showcase his talents, which landed in the hands of soul artist [Lionel Richie](http://www.last.fm/music/Lionel+Richie). Richie invited Marx to Hollywood saying, “I can’t promise you anything, but you should come to L.A.” Marx would eventually appear as a background singer in Richie’s songs “[You Are](http://www.last.fm/music/Lionel+Richie/_/You+Are)” and “[Running With the Night](http://www.last.fm/music/Lionel+Richie/_/Running+With+the+Night)” as well as on Richie’s follow-up album, which included the smash hit “[All Night Long](http://www.last.fm/music/Lionel+Richie/_/All+Night+Long)”.      *[Richard Marx](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Marx/Richard+Marx)*   Marx’s first album, a self-titled work, went multi-platinum, selling nearly 4 million copies.
