Junior Murvin (born Murvin Junior Smith, circa 1949, Port Antonio, Jamaica; died 2 December 2013, Port Antonio, Jamaica) was a Jamaican reggae musician. He is best known for the single “Police and Thieves”, produced by [Lee “Scratch” Perry](http://www.last.fm/music/Lee+%22Scratch%22+Perry) in 1976. Murvin’s soaring voice and the infectious rhythm made “Police and Thieves” into an international hit during the summer of that year. It peaked at No. 23 in the UK Singles Chart in 1980. The song was influential, and it was recorded by the punk rock pioneers [The Clash](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Clash) on their debut album, released in 1977. Australian musician [Paul Kelly](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Kelly) made a reference to Murvin in his Christmas song, “How To Make Gravy”.
