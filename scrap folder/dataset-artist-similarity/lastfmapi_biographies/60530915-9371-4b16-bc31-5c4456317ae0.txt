**Natalie Jane Imbruglia** (born 4 February 1975) is an Australian [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) and actress. The second of the four daughters of an Italian father and an Australian mother, Natalie grew up on the Central Coast, North of Sydney, Australia. As a teenager she played a role in the soap Neighbours before venturing into a singing career.      Her first single, “[Torn](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Imbruglia/_/Torn)”, reached number 2 in the UK charts and became the most played song on the radio in 1998. “Torn” is originally written by [Anne Preven](http://www.last.fm/music/Anne+Preven), Scott Cutler and Phil Thornalley. In 1995, “Torn” was recorded by Preven’s and Cutler’s band [Ednaswap](http://www.last.fm/music/Ednaswap), although the band would record several more versions prior and following Imbruglia’s hit recording. The first released version of “Torn”, though, was a 1993 version by Danish singer [Lis Sørensen](http://www.last.fm/music/Lis+S%C3%B8rensen), entitled “Braendt”. Norwegian singer [Trine Rein](http://www.last.fm/music/Trine+Rein) had a hit with an English language version of “Torn” in her home country, a year prior to Imbruglia’s million selling single. Co-writer Phil Thornalley was involved in all of these versions and eventually offered the song to Natalie Imbruglia, whose album he produced. Imbruglia initially declined recording the song, stating she didn’t want to do a cover. Ironically, “Torn” did not only become her biggest hit, it also became her signature song.      Following “[Torn](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Imbruglia/_/Torn)”, Natalie’s debut album “[Left of the Middle](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Imbruglia/Left+of+the+Middle)”, released on November 1997, became a million seller. Further singles (“[Big Mistake](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Imbruglia/_/Big+Mistake)”, “[Wishing I Was There](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Imbruglia/_/Wishing+I+Was+There)”, and “[Smoke](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Imbruglia/_/Smoke)”), again proved to be hits in terms of radio and video airplay, but had a less than stellar chart run compared to “Torn”.      In a 1999 cooperation with singer [Tom Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Jones), she appeared on his duet album “[Reload](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Jones/Reload)”, on which the pair teamed up for a cover of [INXS](http://www.last.fm/music/INXS)’ “”[Never Tear Us Apart](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Jones/_/Never+Tear+Us+Apart)”.      Imbruglia’s sophomore album, “[White Lilies Island](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Imbruglia/White+Lilies+Island)”, was released in November 2001, although it met with significantly less success than its precursor. It did spawn the UK hit singles “[That Day](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Imbruglia/_/That+Day)”, “[Wrong Impression](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Imbruglia/_/Wrong+Impression)” and “[Beauty on the Fire](http://www.last
