Big Daddy Kane (born Antonio Hardy, September 10, 1968) is a rapper from Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in the notorious Bed-Stuy section of Brooklyn. During his career, he has worked with artists including [Biz Markie](http://www.last.fm/music/Biz+Markie), [Marley Marl](http://www.last.fm/music/Marley+Marl), [Teddy Riley](http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Riley), [Rudy Ray Moore](http://www.last.fm/music/Rudy+Ray+Moore) and [Barry White](http://www.last.fm/music/Barry+White). Part of Marley Marl’s legendary [Juice Crew](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Crew), he also penned lyrics for fellow members Biz Markie and [Roxanne Shante](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Roxanne+Shante). Kane was responsible for jump-starting the career of [Jay-Z](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay-Z), now a hugely commercially successful rapper who got his start as Kane’s hypeman.      Widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers during the ‘golden age’ of [hip hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip%20hop) (1986–1993), Kane’s experimentation with R&B beats and his alignment to the Five Percent faction drew criticism. Later albums, such as Looks Like a Job For…, were acclaimed, but he was never able to return to the commercial and artistic success of [It’s a Big Daddy Thing](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Daddy+Kane/It%27s+a+Big+Daddy+Thing). However, he still tours extensively and is involved in several upcoming projects. He recently featured in [Morcheeba](http://www.last.fm/music/Morcheeba)’s hip hop trip song ‘What’s your Name’.      During 1996, before the murder of [2Pac](http://www.last.fm/music/2Pac), it was said that Pac intended to start his own label, Makaveli Records, featuring promintently East Coast acts; one of the artists he intended to sign was Kane, and the two even recorded a song before the rapper’s death, entitled Wherever U Are.      Big Daddy Kane has posed for Playgirl and [Madonna](http://www.last.fm/music/Madonna)’s Sex book. As an actor, he debuted in Mario Van Peebles’ western, Posse.      Big Daddy Kane is famous for his pimp persona that is portrayed in his lyrics. He is famous for the title of his song, “Pimpin’ Ain’t Easy”. The backronym “King Asiatic Nobody’s Equal,” is often applied to his moniker.      Recently (especially as of 2002), Big Daddy Kane has been increasingly doing collaborations with underground/alternative hip hop artists (ie. [Little Brother](http://www.last.fm/music/Little+Brother), [The Alchemist](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Alchemist) and [DJ Babu](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Babu) from the [Beat Junkies](http://www.last.fm/music/Beat+Junkies)) and Kane has mentioned that he is not intending to release another solo album as he is looking towards a career in acting.      **Discography**   1988 Long Live the Kane ([Cold Chillin’](http://www.last
