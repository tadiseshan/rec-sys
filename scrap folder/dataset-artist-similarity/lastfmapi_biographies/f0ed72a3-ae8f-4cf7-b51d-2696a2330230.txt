**Keith Richards** (born 18 December 1943 in Dartford, Kent), is an English guitarist and songwriter, best known for his work with [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones). Richards has played guitar on releases by [Chuck Berry](http://www.last.fm/music/Chuck+Berry), [Max Romeo](http://www.last.fm/music/Max+Romeo), [Hubert Sumlin](http://www.last.fm/music/Hubert+Sumlin), [Les Paul](http://www.last.fm/music/Les+Paul), [Tom Waits](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits), [Bono](http://www.last.fm/music/Bono) and [The Edge](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Edge) of [U2](http://www.last.fm/music/U2), [Nona Hendryx](http://www.last.fm/music/Nona+Hendryx), [John Phillips](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Phillips) and [Aretha Franklin](http://www.last.fm/music/Aretha+Franklin). He was first known to the public as Keith Richard because [Andrew Loog Oldham](http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Loog+Oldham), the first manager of the Stones, removed the “s” to resemble the name of popstar [Cliff Richard](http://www.last.fm/music/Cliff+Richard); Richards later restored the “s” to his surname. “The Human Riff” and “Keef Riffhard” are lasting epithets.
