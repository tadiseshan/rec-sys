[Percee P](http://www.last.fm/music/Percee+P) (b. John Percy Simon, 1971) is an underground hip-hop artist from the Patterson Projects, South Bronx, New York City. He is known in the underground for selling his mixtapes himself at shows and in front of Fat Beats and for his many guest appearances on other alternative and underground hip-hop artists’ releases. He has worked with such rappers as [Big Daddy Kane](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Daddy+Kane), [Kool Keith](http://www.last.fm/music/Kool+Keith), [Lord Finesse](http://www.last.fm/music/Lord+Finesse), [Aesop Rock](http://www.last.fm/music/Aesop+Rock), [Edan](http://www.last.fm/music/Edan), [Jurassic 5](http://www.last.fm/music/Jurassic+5), [C-Rayz Walz](http://www.last.fm/music/C-Rayz+Walz), [Jaylib](http://www.last.fm/music/Jaylib), [Jedi Mind Tricks](http://www.last.fm/music/Jedi+Mind+Tricks), [Maestro Fresh Wes](http://www.last.fm/music/Maestro+Fresh+Wes), [Wildchild](http://www.last.fm/music/Wildchild), and many more. Percee is something of a legend in the underground scene due to his ubiquitous presence, yet complete determination to stay hardcore underground.      His legendary battle with [Lord Finesse](http://www.last.fm/music/Lord+Finesse) from 1989 was immortalized on [Edan](http://www.last.fm/music/Edan)’s Fast Rap mixtape, and a complete video of it has since surfaced as a bonus feature on the SBX DVD.      In 2005, MTA Records released [Legendary Status](http://www.last.fm/music/Percee+P/Legendary+Status), a compilation of material featuring guest spots and live performances from the last 15 years.      Despite Percee P having recorded music since the late 80’s, his first full- length album, [Perseverance](http://www.stonesthrow.com/records/sth2120.html) wasn’t released until September 18, 2007 on Stones Throw Records. The entire records is produced by [Madlib](http://www.last.fm/music/Madlib) and features [Diamond D](http://www.last.fm/music/Diamond+D), [Prince Po](http://www.last.fm/music/Prince+Po), [Aesop Rock](http://www.last.fm/music/Aesop+Rock), [Chali 2na](http://www.last.fm/music/Chali+2na), [Vinnie Paz](http://www.last.fm/music/Vinnie+Paz), [Guilty Simpson](http://www.last.fm/music/Guilty+Simpson), and Madlib.
