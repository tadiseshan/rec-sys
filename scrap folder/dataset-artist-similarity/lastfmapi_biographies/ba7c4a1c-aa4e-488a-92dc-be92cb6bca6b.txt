Donna Lewis (born 6 August 1973, in Cardiff) is a Welsh singer-songwriter and record producer best known for the 1996 single “I Love You Always Forever”.      “I Love You Always Forever” was hugely successful on U.S. radio, staying at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks and spending thirteen consecutive weeks at number one on the airplay chart. It exceeded one million “spins” on radio to claim its place in music industry history as the most-played single up to that point. The single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart in 1996. The popularity of the song shot Lewis’s debut album, Now in a Minute, to platinum status.      Her second LP, Blue Planet, won critical acclaim, but it was largely overlooked by the public. Although it eventually produced a U.S. number-one dance single, “Love Him”, Lewis parted ways with Atlantic Records and independently produced her third LP, Be Still, which featured Lewis on an almost entirely acoustic set. Lewis was featured as a guest vocalist on several trance music/house music recordings. Her most recent LP, In the Pink, was release in 2008.
