**Elvis Costello** (born Declan Patrick MacManus on 25 August 1954) is an internationally known English [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter). Gaining prominence as an early participant in London’s [pub rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/pub%20rock) scene in the mid-[70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s), he burst into fame with his critically acclaimed 1977 debut ‘_[My Aim Is True](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello/My+Aim+Is+True)_’, still one of the most successful debuts of all time. He soon did much work in the genres of [punk rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk%20rock), [power pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/power%20pop), and [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) after he formed [Elvis Costello & The Attractions](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello+&+The+Attractions). In a long and successful career, Costello has released over thirty studio albums on his own and with the Attractions, the Imposters, and other collaborations, praised by many critics for his literate, witty songwriting.      Born in St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington in London, Costello is the son of trumpeter, vocalist and band-leader Ronald (“Ross”) MacManus and record store manager Lillian Costello. His family had roots in Merseyside and he moved to Birkenhead at age 16, with his mother, when his parents separated. While he is better known as ‘Elvis Costello’, a stage name referring to the legendary [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley) suggested by Stiff Records manager Jake Riviera, he has used many other aliases, including ‘The Imposter’ and ‘Napoleon Dynamite’.      In the early 1970s Costello was a participant in London’s pub rock scene with the group Flip City. Then in 1977 along with fellow Pub-Rockers Nick Lowe and Ian Dury he made his first releases on the independent label Stiff, tailoring his work towards the burgeoning [punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk), [power pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/power%20pop), and [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) scenes. From 1980’s _Armed Forces_ onwards, however, other influences including soul, country, 1960s pop, and classical music began to re-emerge, and he soon became established as a unique and original voice. His output has been wildly diverse: one critic has written that “Costello, the pop encyclopedia, can reinvent the past in his own image”.      His prolific and varied 30-year career has been marked by two constants: sharp songwriting and musical restlessness. The latter has seen him dabble in almost every musical form, from country to jazz to orchestral. This stems from the fact that, at heart, Costello is a fan. His desire to work with his musical heroes has attracted collaborators as diverse as [Burt Bacharach](http://www.last.fm/music/Burt+Bacharach) and [Paul McCartney](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney), [Anne Sofie von Otter](http://www.last.fm/music/Anne+Sofie+von+Otter), [Allen Toussaint](http://www.last.fm/music/Allen+Toussaint), [Aimee Mann](http://www
