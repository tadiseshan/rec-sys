From Karl’s own unbiased biography, available on the K Records website:      “I, Karl Blau, am a recording artist from Anacortes, WA. My debut K record “[Beneath Waves](http://www.last.fm/music/Karl+Blau/Beneath+Waves)” should be available in January of 2006. You may have heard my flute, sax, or drums on various K records. I’ve recorded with [Mirah](http://www.last.fm/music/Mirah), [Wolf Colonel](http://www.last.fm/music/Wolf+Colonel), the Microphones, [Little Wings](http://www.last.fm/music/Little+Wings), and I’m one third of the band D+(with Phil Elverum and Bret Lunsford). And more recently I’ve been touring & recording with the fabulous Laura Veirs.      About 2 years ago I started an “album-a-month club” called KELP! monthly. KELP! is a documentary label tracing my musical path, an avenue for my over- active creative side. People who enjoy the mystery subscribe up to a year and start receiving my records which have included—but will not be limited to—full length albums of mine and artists I’m producing, field recordings, compilations of artists and ambient art records.      I was born into music; my parents met in high school band, Dad was a trumpeter and Mom french horn. I was required to study music starting with 3 years piano, but quickly moved out of the shadow of my older brother’s skills and into classical guitar and started getting together with friends and forming bands as early as 12 years old.      With a long stint in the dance band Captain Fathom that lasted through college in Bellingham, I learned the value of all age shows. Captain Fathom played the Skagit Valley’s Rexville Grange hall and other halls and spaces, and the shows acted as community gatherings of babies to elders
