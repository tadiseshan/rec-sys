**[Fleetwood Mac](http://www.fleetwoodmac.com)** is a British and American [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band formed in 1967. From the band’s inception through the end of 1974, no incarnation of Fleetwood Mac lasted longer than two years, but all featured core members [Mick Fleetwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Fleetwood) and [John McVie](http://www.last.fm/music/John+McVie). Their two most successful periods have been during the late [60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s) British [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) boom, when they were led by guitarist/[singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) [Peter Green](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Green), and from 1975 to 1987, when they went a [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop)-oriented direction with musicians [Christine McVie](http://www.last.fm/music/Christine+McVie), [Lindsey Buckingham](http://www.last.fm/music/Lindsey+Buckingham), and [Stevie Nicks](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Nicks).      The band enjoyed more modest success in the intervening period between 1971 and 1974, with a line-up that included [Bob Welch](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Welch), and also during the [90s](http://www.last.fm/tag/90s), which saw more personnel changes before the return of Nicks and Buckingham in 1997. More recently, the departure of [Christine McVie](http://www.last.fm/music/Christine+McVie) from Fleetwood Mac in 1998 shifted around the group’s plans for many years. McVie returned to the fold in 2014 and a coming tour featuring the reunited line-up is in the works.      The only member present in the band from the very beginning is its namesake drummer [Mick Fleetwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Fleetwood). Bassist [John McVie](http://www.last.fm/music/John+McVie), despite his giving part of his name to the band, did not play on their first single nor at their first concerts. Keyboardist [Christine McVie](http://www.last.fm/music/Christine+McVie) has, to date, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album ‘_[Kiln House](http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/Kiln+House)_’.      The band was started in London in 1967 by guitarist [Peter Green](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Green), who recruited the rhythm section of [John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/John+May all%27s+Bluesbreakers): drummer [Mick Fleetwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Fleetwood) and bass guitarist [John McVie](http://www.last.fm/music/John+McVie). Green himself had replaced a departing member, [Eric Clapton](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton), as the lead guitarist of the “Bluesbreakers;” Green and McVie had appeared on [John Mayall](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Mayall)’s 1967 _[A Hard Road](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Mayall/A+Hard+Road)_ album. The band employed another bassist, [Bob Brunning](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Brunning), until John McVie was persuaded to join the band
