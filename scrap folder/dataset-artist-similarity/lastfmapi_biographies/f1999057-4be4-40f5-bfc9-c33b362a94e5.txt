**Brendan Benson** is a [Detroit](http://www.last.fm/tag/detroit), [Michigan](http://www.last.fm/tag/michigan) born musician and [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter). He plays guitar, bass guitar, keyboard and drums. He has released four solo albums and is a member of the band [The Raconteurs](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Raconteurs).      His music is typically labeled as [power pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/power%20pop), though he doesn’t completely agree. His major musical influences include [The Cars](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cars), [David Bowie](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie), [Electric Light Orchestra](http://www.last.fm/music/Electric+Light+Orchestra), [Elvis Costello](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello), [The Kinks](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks), [Robyn Hitchcock](http://www.last.fm/music/Robyn+Hitchcock), [Paul McCartney](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney), and [Todd Rundgren](http://www.last.fm/music/Todd+Rundgren).      His debut album, _One Mississippi_, was released in 1996 on Virgin Records. The album featured several contributions with [Jason Falkner](http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Falkner) and gained many favourable reviews in the music press but failed to sell in sufficient numbers and Benson was dropped by Virgin.      It would be another six years until Benson issued the follow-up, _Lapalco_. Again the critical plaudits poured in but this time the record enjoyed a certain degree of [commercial](http://www.last.fm/tag/commercial) success.      While touring this record Benson played the Reading and Leeds Festivals and finished his Leeds set with a performance of the track “Jet Lag” featuring guest appearances from Meg White of [The White Stripes](http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes) along with members of [The Datsuns](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Datsuns) and [Soledad Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/Soledad+Brothers).      In 2003 Benson re-released his debut album along with bonus tracks including the unreleased six track extended player, _Welfed Boy EP_, featuring songs from a demo session with Falkner.      Also in 2003, Benson released an EP, _Metarie_, with his then band, [The Wellfed Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Wellfed+Boys). The EP featured a cover of Paul McCartney’s “Let Me Roll It”. This was the first song written completely by another artist to be featured on a Benson release. Another cover, this time “Strong Boy”, from [Gram Parsons International Submarine Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Gram+Parsons+International+Submarine+Band)’s 1968 album, _Safe at Home_, was released as a b-side in 2005.      In 2005, Benson released his third album, _The Alternative to Love_, and toured extensively in the US, UK and Europe with his new touring band, [The Stiff Tissues](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stiff+Tissues).      Benson is also a member of The Raconteurs, a collaboration with [Jack White](http://www.last
