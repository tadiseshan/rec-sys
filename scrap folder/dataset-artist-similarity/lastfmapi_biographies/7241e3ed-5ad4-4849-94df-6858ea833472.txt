The record is mainly made up of covers that Lovett has played, but never got round to recording.      The four-time Grammy winner has acted in a number of films and been a guest- star on television. Lovett was married to actress Julia Roberts for a short time in the mid-1990s. In 2002, he was gored by a bull while working on his uncle’s farm in Texas, but soon recovered and resumed touring.
