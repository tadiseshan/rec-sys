Gram Parsons (November 5, 1946 – September 19, 1973) was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist and pianist born Ingram Cecil Connor, III. A solo artist as well as a member of [The International Submarine Band](http://www.last.fm/music/The+International+Submarine+Band), [The Byrds](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Byrds) and [The Flying Burrito Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Flying+Burrito+Brothers), he is best known for a series of recordings which anticipate the country rock of the 1970s and the alt-country movement that began in the 80s. Parsons was a close friend of [Keith Richards](http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Richards) and is also credited for turning [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones) onto country music in their ‘Let it Bleed’-era.   Parsons described his records as “Cosmic American Music”. He died of a drug overdose, at the age of 26, on September 19, 1973. Parsons’ body was stolen from the airport and cremated on a makeshift outdoor funeral pyre (coffin and five gallons of gas) at Cap Rock,Joshua Tree by his road manager, Phil Kaufmann.      Cecil Ingram Connor III (November 5, 1946 – September 19, 1973), known professionally as Gram Parsons, was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and pianist. Parsons is best known for his work within the country music genre; he also popularized what he called “Cosmic American Music”, a hybrid of country, rhythm and blues, soul, folk, and rock.[1][2] Besides recording as a solo artist, he also worked in several notable bands, including the International Submarine Band, The Byrds, and The Flying Burrito Brothers. His relatively short career is described by Allmusic as “enormously influential” for both country and rock, “blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other.”[3]   Parsons was born in Winter Haven, Florida and developed an interest in country music while attending Harvard University. He founded the International Submarine Band in 1966, and after several months of delay their debut, Safe at Home, was released in 1968, by which time the group had disbanded. Parsons joined The Byrds in early 1968, and played a pivotal role in the making of the seminal Sweetheart of the Rodeo album. After leaving the group in late 1968, Parsons and fellow Byrd Chris Hillman formed The Flying Burrito Brothers in 1969, releasing their debut, The Gilded Palace of Sin, the same year. The album was well received but failed commercially; after a sloppy cross-country tour, they hastily recorded Burrito Deluxe. Parsons was fired from the band before its release in early 1970. He soon signed with A&M Records, but after several unproductive sessions he canceled his intended solo debut in early 1971. Parsons moved to France, where he lived for a short period at Villa Nellcôte with his friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones
