Mason Durell Betha (born August 27, 1975),[1] better known by stage name Mase (often typeset as Ma$e) who was previously known as Murda Ma$e, is an American rapper, songwriter, actor and inspirational speaker. He was an artist on Sean “Diddy” Combs’s hip hop label Bad Boy Records. He was introduced as Bad Boy Entertainment’s next big artist during the summer of 1996 when he was featured on the remix to 112’s debut single, “Only You”, which peaked at number one on Billboard’s Hot Dance Singles Sales chart as well as its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. With his soon-to-be-trademarked[citation needed] slow flow, Mase quickly developed a crossover fan base as he was featured on original tracks, as well as remixes, by popular R&B artists such as Brian McKnight, Mariah Carey, Keith Sweat, and Brandy, among others. Puff Daddy (Diddy) featured Mase on “Mo’ Money, Mo’ Problems” from The Notorious B.I.G.’s double- LP Life After Death, the album’s biggest hit single. He then featured Mase on several songs on his own debut album, No Way Out: the lead single, “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down”, which hit number one on the Rap, R&B, and Pop charts, as well as on “Been Around the World”, which would also reach number one on Billboard’s Hot Rap Tracks. By the time Mase released his own debut album, Harlem World, in late 1997, the rapper had become Bad Boy’s premier artist, filling the void left by the death of Biggie Smalls. He is married to Twyla Betha and leads an international ministry.
