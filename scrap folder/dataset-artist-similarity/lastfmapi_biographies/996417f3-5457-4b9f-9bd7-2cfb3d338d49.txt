Beverley Craven is a British singer, born 28 June 1963 in Colombo, Sri Lanka.      She had her greatest success in the early 1990s, and is best known for the hit “Promise Me” which hit Number 3 in the UK singles chart in 1991. Craven achieved another five entries in the same chart over the next two years.      After meeting backstage at a Tears for Fears concert, Craven is married to singer/songwriter Colin Campsie, and the couple have three daughters. Campsie and Craven used to own the top & bottom flats in a three-storey house in London. When the person in the middle moved out, they bought the flat and converted the building back into one house. The family now live in Buckinghamshire.      She survived Breast cancer in 2005, and was given the all clear in February 2006.
