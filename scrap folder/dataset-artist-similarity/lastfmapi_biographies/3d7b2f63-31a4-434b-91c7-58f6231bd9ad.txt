Nina Nastasia is a New York City-based singer-songwriter born in Hollywood, California. Her music is noted for an eclectic mix of [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) delicacy and intricate [chamber music](http://www.last.fm/tag/chamber%20music) arrangements worked out with her band and partner Kennan Gudjonsson.      Nastasia has released six albums so far, the first of which, [Dogs](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/Dogs), was initially released in 2000 in a miniscule edition of 1000 copies on Socialist Records. The album sold out quickly and her subsequent albums, [The Blackened Air](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/The+Blackened+Air) (2001) and [Run To Ruin](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/Run+To+Ruin) (2003) were released on indie label [Touch And Go](http://www.last.fm/label/Touch+And+Go) Records. The label also re-released Dogs in 2004. All three albums were recorded by Steve Albini, as were later albums released on [Fat Cat Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Fat+Cat+Records). These include [On Leaving](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/On+Leaving) in 2006 and [You Follow Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/You+Follow+Me) (produced in collaboration with [Jim White](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+White)) in 2007. Her sixth and most recent album, [Outlaster](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/Outlaster), was also recorded by Steve Albini and was released in June 2010, preceded by the single [Cry, Cry, Baby](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/_/Cry,+Cry,+Baby) in May.      Nastasia was a favorite of late BBC disc jockey [John Peel](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Peel) and recorded six sessions for his shows. The last one was recorded with the help of Tuvan throat singing group Huun-Huur-Tu. Nastasia also contributed a song to the tribute compilation for Peel named “[Bird of Cuzco](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/_/Bird+of+Cuzco)”. Two of Nastasia’s songs made Peel’s annual Festive Fifty: “[Ugly Face](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/_/Ugly+Face)” (ranked 4th in 2002) and “[You, Her & Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/_/You,+Her+&+Me)” (13th in 2003).      **Discography**:      Albums   2000 [Dogs](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/Dogs) (Socialist)   2004 [Dogs](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/Dogs) re-released (Touch and Go)   2001 [The Blackened Air](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/The+Blackened+Air) (Touch and Go)   2003 [Run To Ruin](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/Run+To+Ruin) (Touch and Go)   2006 [On Leaving](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/On+Leaving) (Fat Cat)   2007 [You Follow Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/You+Follow+Me) [with [Jim White](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+White)] (Fat Cat)   2010 [Outlaster](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/Outlaster) (Fat Cat)      Singles   2008 [What She Doesn’t Know](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Nastasia/What+She+Doesn%27t+Know) (Fat Cat)   2010 [Cry, Cry, Baby](http://www.last
