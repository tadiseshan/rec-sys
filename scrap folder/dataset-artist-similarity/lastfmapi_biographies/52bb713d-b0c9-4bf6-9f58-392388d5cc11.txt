Powell originally trained as a violinist as a child, before studying at London’s Trinity College of Music. He later ventured into jazz and rock music, playing in a soul band The Fabulistics. On leaving college, he composed music for commercials, which led to a job as an assistant to the composer [Patrick Doyle](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrick+Doyle) on several film productions, including “Much Ado About Nothing”.      In 1995 he co-founded the London-based commercial music house Independently Thinking Music, which produced scores for more than 100 British and French commercials and independent films.

Powell is one of the best known former members of the Remote Control (formerly known as Media Ventures) team of film composers and has a scoring style that incorporates both traditional orchestral and more modern, synthesized elements.      He recently wrote the scores for “X-Men: The Last Stand”, “United 93”, “Happy Feet”, “The Bourne Ultimatum”, “Mr. & Mrs. Smith”, and “How to Train Your Dragon”.
