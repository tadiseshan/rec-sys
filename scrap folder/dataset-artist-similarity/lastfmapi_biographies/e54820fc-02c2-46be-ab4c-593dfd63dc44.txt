Teddy Geiger catapulted to stardom with the million selling hit, “For You I Will”, featured on Geiger’s critically acclaimed debut album, Underage Thinking, which entered the Billboard charts at #8 in 2006. Just 16-years old, Teddy launched a 3-year international tour and grabbed silver screen spotlight by starring opposite Emma Stone in 2008’s The Rocker, and playing the muse in the cult hit TV series, Love Monkey.      A multi-instrumentalist and producer, Geiger’s sheer breadth of musicality imprints a bold stamp in the lexicon of American pop with his sophomore album, The Last Fears available on iTunes everywhere now. The self-produced album establishes the re-emergence of Geiger as a singer/songwriter at the forefront of the independent American music landscape, blending traditional pop structure with accents of electronica and ballads tinged with sounds as close to home as mandolins and steel guitars.      Teddy is a versatile songwriter/producer and is a featured artist on Tiesto’s forthcoming album Clublife 3 Stockholm with the single “Love and Run”.
