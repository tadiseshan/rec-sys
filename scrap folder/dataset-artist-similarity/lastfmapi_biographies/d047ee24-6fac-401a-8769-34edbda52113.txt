**Lloyd Price** (born 9 March 1933 in Kenner, Louisiana) was a [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) music star and early [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll) pioneer who had a big hit with “[Lawdy Miss Clawdy](http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Price/_/Lawdy+Miss+Clawdy)”, a track he wrote (featuring [Fats Domino](http://www.last.fm/music/Fats+Domino) on piano) that topped the R&B charts for seven weeks in 1952. Staying with [Specialty Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Specialty+Records), Price then released “[Oooh, Oooh, Oooh](http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Price/_/Oooh,+Oooh,+Oooh)”, “[Restless Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Price/_/Restless+Heart)”, “[Tell Me Pretty Baby](http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Price/_/Tell+Me+Pretty+Baby)” and “[Ain’t It a Shame](http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Price/_/Ain%27t+It+a+Shame)”. He was then drafted and ended up in Korea from 1953-1956.      After returning from the military, Price became more financially savvy than many of his fellow early [rock n roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20n%20roll) and gritty R&B artists. In 1957, he decided to launch his own label KRC ([Kent](http://www.last.fm/label/Kent) Record Company) and retain control of his masters, leasing his tracks to labels like [Atlantic](http://www.last.fm/label/Atlantic) and later ABC-Paramount in an arrangement that likely inspired [Ray Charles](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles) to do the same.      His first single after returning from Korea was “[Just Because](http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Price/_/Just+Because)”. That was followed by a massive hit, “[Stagger Lee](http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Price/_/Stagger+Lee)”, which has appeared in many multi-artist collection albums and served as one of Price’s best known songs. Television host Dick Clark insisted the violent content of the track, which lyrically describes a shooting based on a gambling fight, be toned down when Price appeared on the popular but highly sanitized show American Bandstand.      Price’s biggest year was likely 1959, during which he had four hit records: “[Personality](http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Price/_/Personality),” “[Where Were You (On Our Wedding Day)](http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Price/_/Where+We re+You+\(On+Our+Wedding+Day\)),” “[I’m Gonna Get Married](http://www.last.fm/m usic/Lloyd+Price/_/I%E2%80%99m+Gonna+Get+Married)” and “[Come Into My Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Price/_/Come+Into+My+Heart).” His increasing entrepreneurial efforts soon included new record labels and starting the Turntable nightclub in New York City. Price’s [Double L Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Double+L+Records), started with partner Harold Logan discovered [Wilson Pickett](http://www.last.fm/music/Wilson+Pickett), who got his career started on their label. Price’s biggest hit for Double-l was a 1963 revival of the old standard “[Misty](http://www.last
