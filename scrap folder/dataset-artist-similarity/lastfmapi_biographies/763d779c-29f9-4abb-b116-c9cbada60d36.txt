Boston rapper Akrobatik (born Jared Bridgeman) released his first single, Ruff Enough, in 1998. Independent New York label [Rawkus](http://www.last.fm/label/Rawkus) released his second single, Internet MCs, but it was his next release, Say Yes Say Word, that achieved anthem status and solidified Akrobatik’s reputation as a talented MC. A frequent partner in rhyme with fellow Bostonian [Mr. Lif](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Lif), Akrobatik appeared on both the Emergency Rations EP and Lif’s full-length, [I Phantom](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Lif/I+Phantom), before dropping his own debut, Balance, in 2003.      Together with Mr Lif and DJ [Fakts One](http://www.last.fm/music/Fakts+One) he has also formed a group, known as [The Perceptionists](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Perceptionists). In 2005 they released their highly praised debut, [Black Dialogue](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Perceptionists/Black+Dialogue).
