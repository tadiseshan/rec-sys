He is known for his powerful style and wide vocal range. After Led Zeppelin’s breakup following the sudden death of drummer [John Bonham](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Bonham) in 1980, Plant pursued a successful solo career. Popular tracks from this period include “[Big Log](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Plant/_/Big+Log)”, “[Tall Cool One](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Plant/_/Tall+Cool+One)”, “[In the Mood](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Plant/_/In+the+Mood)”, and “[I Believe](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Plant/_/I+Believe)”.

The band had a Top Ten hit with their song “[Sea of Love](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Honeydrippers/_/Sea+of+Love)”, a remake of the [Phil Phillips](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Phillips)’ chestnut. Plant’s also notably performed with Page in the outfit [Page & Plant](http://www.last.fm/music/Page+&+Plant).      Plant’s love of the music of Morocco led him to a new collaboration called [Robert Plant And The Strange Sensation](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Plant+And+The+Strange+Sensation). The band’s releases met with critical acclaim and numerous Grammy nominations. They completed a notable 2006 tour of Europe in September.
