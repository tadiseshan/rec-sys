**Frederick Lincoln “Link” Wray Jr** (May 2, 1929 – November 5, 2005) was an American [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll) guitarist, songwriter and occasional singer.      Wray was noted for pioneering a new sound for electric guitars, as exemplified in his hit 1958 instrumental “[Rumble](http://www.last.fm/music/Link+Wray/_/Rumble)”, by Link Wray and his Ray Men, which pioneered an overdriven, distorted electric guitar sound, and also for having “invented the power chord, the major modus operandi of modern rock guitarist,” “and in doing so fathering,” or making possible, “punk and heavy rock”. Rolling Stone included Link at number 67 on their list of the 100 greatest guitarist of all time.      Wray was born in Dunn, North Carolina to Lillie M. Coats and Frederick Lincoln Wray. It was there that Link first heard slide guitar at age eight from a traveling carnival worker, an African-American man named “Hambone.” Wray was a veteran of the Korean war, where he contracted tuberculosis that ultimately cost him a lung. His doctors told him that he would never sing again. So Link concentrated on his heavy guitar work. Despite this, on his rare vocal numbers he displays a strong voice and a range equivalent to [Clarence “Frogman” Henry](http://www.last.fm/music/Clarence+%22Frogman%22+Henry).      Part Shawnee Indian, Wray frequently spoke of his ancestry in performances and interviews. Three of the songs he performed bear the names of American Indian tribes: “[Shawnee](http://www.last.fm/music/Link+Wray/_/Shawnee)”, “[Apache](http://www.last.fm/music/Link+Wray/_/Apache)”, and “[Comanche](http://www.last.fm/music/Link+Wray/_/Comanche).” “Apache” was an instrumental composed by [Jerry Lordan](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Lordan), which became a hit in the UK for [The Shadows](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Shadows) in 1960. Wray recorded one of the better covers of the song 30 years later, somehow finding new life in this mythic, minor-key, guitar/drum dialogue which by then was also associated with everyone from [The Ventures](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ventures) to [The Incredible Bongo Band](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Incredible+Bongo+Band).      After discharge from the Army, Wray and his brothers Doug and Vernon Wray, with friends Shorty Horton and Dixie Neal, formed Lucky Wray and the Lazy Pine Wranglers, later known as Lucky Wray and the Palomino Ranch Hands. They had been playing [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) music and [western swing](http://www.last.fm/tag/western%20swing) for several years when they took a gig as the house band on the daily live TV show Milt Grant’s House Party, a Washington, D.C. version of American Bandstand. The band made their first recordings in 1956 as Lucky Wray and the Palomino Ranch Hands for [Starday](http://www.last.fm/label/Starday) Records.      For the TV show, they also backed many performers, from [Fats Domino](http://www.last
