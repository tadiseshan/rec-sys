Robert Steven Moore (born January 18, 1952) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. In addition to having numerous albums released on labels around the world, Moore has self-released over 400 cassette and CD-R albums, as well as dozens of home videos, mostly through the R. Stevie Moore Cassette Club, a home-based label. Moore lives and records in his home/studio in Bloomfield, New Jersey. He is the son of Bob Moore, veteran Nashville A-Team bassist, producer, and orchestra leader, as well as a longtime sideman for [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley).      In February 2005, newspaper writer Tammy LaGorce described Moore as a “lo-fi legend” in the New York Times.      Moore, born in Nashville, Tennessee, made his commercial recording debut at age seven, singing a duet with Jim Reeves entitled “[But You Love Me, Daddy](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Reeves/_/But+You+Love+Me,+Daddy)” on the RCA Victor album [Songs To Warm The Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Reeves/Songs+To+Warm+The+Heart).      Moore was gifted with intuitive proficiency for guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion, and songwriting. In 1966, he began pursuing what would become his lifelong passion, home recording, using a reel-to-reel tape deck set up in his basement. In 1967, he formed his first band, The Marlborough (a rock combo). He also began working for his father as a studio musician, and as an assistant at Mimosa Music, his father’s music publishing company.      After dropping out of Vanderbilt University in 1971 to pursue a career as a professional artist, performer and entertainer Moore issued his home-recorded 1976 debut album [Phonography](http://www.last.fm/music/R.+Stevie+Moore/Phonography) on his uncle Harry “H.P.” Palmer’s HP Music label. The initial run was limited to 100 copies. Trouser Press gave the album rave reviews, calling it “an outrageous collection of musical brain spewage” and “a true slash of genius”. Moore moved from Nashville to New Jersey shortly afterwards, his uncle releasing two further collections, The Stance EP, and [Delicate Tension](http://www.last.fm/music/R.+Stevie+Moore/Delicate+Tension) in 1978 (Moore’s home tape releases continuing at the same time).      In 1996, in a gesture far overdue, “Phonography” was listed among “the fifty most significant indie records” in Rolling Stone’s Alt-Rock-A-Rama.      1980 saw an important tape release, [Clack!](http://www.last.fm/music/R.+Stevie+Moore/Clack!), this time recorded professionally. In 1981, Moore set up the RSM Cassette Club as an outlet for his home-recorded work, making available all tapes recorded by Moore stretching back to 1968, each listed with a ‘listenability quotient’ rating from 1 to 10.      The next LP release was 1984’s [What’s The Point?!!](http://www.last.fm/music/R
