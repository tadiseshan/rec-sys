Dick Gaughan (born Richard Peter Gaughan on 17 May 1948 in Glasgow) is an influential Scottish musician, singer, and songwriter. He was a founding member of Celtic bands [Boys Of The Lough](http://www.last.fm/music/Boys+Of+The+Lough) (appearing on their first album in 1972) and [Five Hand Reel](http://www.last.fm/music/Five+Hand+Reel) (with whom he played from 1974-1980). On top of that he has a number of fine albums of his own.      Gaughan took up the guitar at the age of seven. Although he has later sung in Scottish Gaelic, he is not fluent in that language; he has a powerful command of his native Scots. He began by singing in Edinburgh folk clubs and became a professional musician in 1970.      He made one solo album, No More Forever (released in 1972), before joining [Boys Of The Lough](http://www.last.fm/music/Boys+Of+The+Lough), singing and playing guitar on their eponymous debut album (released in 1972). After leaving, he was a guest of [The High Level Ranters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+High+Level+Ranters) when they recorded The Bonnie Pit Laddie in 1975, performing on two tracks.      From 1976 to 1978 there then followed a hectic period of his life pursuing two careers, one as a member of [Five Hand Reel](http://www.last.fm/music/Five+Hand+Reel) and one as a soloist. It was a time of hard drinking, travelling continental Europe in vans, and seeing very little of his wife and daughter. The crisis came when his daughter was knocked down by a car while he was away. The daughter survived, but Gaughan had to take stock of his life and re-prioritise things.      He taught himself to read and write music, and in the late 1970s he began to write reviews for what was at the time the only national folk music paper, Folk Review. He also saw more of his family. He joined the agitprop theatre group called 7:84, which was extremely popular at the time for its highly aggressive attacks on Margaret Thatcher and the New Right in general. In this, he appeared to be following in the footsteps of another socialist theatre- director-singer [Ewan MacColl](http://www.last.fm/music/Ewan+MacColl), even recording a tribute album to him in 1978. In the early 1980s he campaigned vigorously for an organisation called Perform, which aimed to unite professional and amateur folk performers into a body to negotiate fees, distribution rights, and to retain artistic control. He was the chair for two years.      Gaughan’s solo albums of the 1980s returned to the acoustic style in which he had begun, containing both traditional ballads (“The Muckle Sangs”) as well as his own songs, and using acoustic guitar (although he can play electric guitar and in fact most fretted instruments). His decision to concentrate on songs which convey a political message, rather than those which might be more easily attractive to the mainstream, is clearly shown in the important albums Handful of Earth (1981) and A Different Kind of Love Song (1983)
