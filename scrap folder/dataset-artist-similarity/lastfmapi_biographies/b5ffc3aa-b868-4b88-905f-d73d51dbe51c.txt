As the lead singer for [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones), **Mick Jagger** is one of the most popular and influential frontman in the history of rock & roll. Jagger fronted the Rolling Stones for over 20 years before he began a solo career in 1985. At the time of the release of his début solo album, She’s the Boss, it appeared that the Stones may have been approaching the end of their career*, but it soon transpired that Jagger’s solo career would run concurrently with that of the band’s. Over the next decade, he released a string of solo albums, none of which achieved the commercial success of the Stones’ less popular releases.      Born Michael Phillip Jagger on July 26, 1943, in Dartford, England, he initially met future musical collaborator and Rolling Stones guitarist [Keith Richards](http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Richards) while the pair were five years old at primary school, although they would lose contact with each other shortly thereafter. In the intervening years, Jagger discovered a love for music, especially early rock & roll (forming a high school band, Little Boy Blue & the Blue Boys), as well as developing an interest in business, attending the London School of Economics.      In 1960 in his late teens, Jagger happened to bump into Richards once again (while the two were waiting on a train platform), and when Richards noticed Jagger had several blues records under his arm, they became friends again and started up the Rolling Stones shortly thereafter. The band (which also included second guitarist [Brian Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Jones), bassist [Bill Wyman](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Wyman), and drummer [Charlie Watts](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Watts)), merged the rock & roll of Chuck Berry with the raw blues of Muddy Waters, creating a style that would be infinitely copied by others in its wake. By the late ’60s, the Rolling Stones were rivaling the Beatles as the world’s most popular rock band (with their second guitarist slot rotating from time to time), issuing such classic singles as “Paint It Black,” “Time Is on My Side,” “Get Off of My Cloud,” “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” and others. In 1968, they began a string of albums that would go down as some of rock’s most quintessential and enduring albums ever recorded — 1968’s Beggar’s Banquet, 1969’s Let It Bleed, 1970’s Get Yer Ya-Ya’s Out, 1971’s Sticky Fingers, and 1972’s Exile on Main Street.      During this time, Jagger also tried his hand at acting in movies, landing roles in such flicks as Performance and Ned Kelly (both from 1970). Jagger also became a renowned playboy and jet setter among other celebrities. As a result (as well as the Stones’ escalating drug abuse), the quality of the Stones’ music began to suffer — while they remained one of the world’s top concert draws and beloved bands, they issued albums of varying quality from the mid-’70s through the early ’80s
