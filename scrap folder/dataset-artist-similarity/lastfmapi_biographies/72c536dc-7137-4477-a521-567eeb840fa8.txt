**Bob Dylan** (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States)) is an American musician, [poet](http://www.last.fm/tag/poet) and artist whose position in popular culture is unique.      Dylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962.      Much of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by [Joan Baez](http://www.last.fm/music/Joan+Baez). Some of his songs, such as “[Blowin’ in the Wind](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Blowin%27+in+the+Wind)” and “[The Times They Are a-Changin’](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/The+Times+They +Are+a-Changin%27)”, became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with [Joan Baez](http://www.last.fm/music/Joan+Baez) and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the and civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.      His album [Bringing It All Back Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Bringing+It+All+Back+Home) marked a move away from the [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) scene and a move towards [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll) and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. [Bringing It All Back Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Bringing+It+All+Back+Home) was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.      The second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song “[Like a Rolling Stone](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Like+a+Rolling+Stone)”, released in July of 1965, later being named “The Greatest Song of All Time” by _Rolling Stone_ magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan’s backing band [The Hawks](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Hawks) (who would later call themselves simply [The Band](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band)). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work
