BarlowGirl is a Christian rock group. Hailing from Chicago, Illinois, the band is made up of three sisters: Rebecca, Lauren, and Alyssa Barlow.      **BarlowGirl’s Philosophy**   The band has gained a following with their “Anti-Conformity” message of “Don’t be conformed, be Transformed” from Romans 12:1-2. Besides believing in abstinence and modesty, the band has also taken a stand on not dating, but their main message remains that people should look to God for love and security, and he will bring everything else into our lives. Very simply, trust God. They encourage people to trust the unseen. Just because you can’t see God doesn’t mean He isn’t there!      **Self Titled Debut Album**   BarlowGirl instantly hit the spotlight in 2004 with their acclaimed self- titled debut album, coupled with the success of its first single, _Never Alone_. The longest running No. 1 song in 2004 on R&R’s CHR and CRW Rock charts, _Never Alone_ was named “Song of the Year” on each of these charts. The CD has sold over 250,000 units (as of April 2005) and featured the singles _Never Alone_ and _Mirror_ which both garnered much airplay on Christian radio stations. These number one songs earned the trio four 2005 GMA (Gospel Music Association) awards (formerly the Dove Award) award nominations, including the prestigious Best New Artist award, Best Rock Song and Rock Album. The trio was the best selling new Christian artist of 2004. BarlowGirl received a 2006 GMA award nomination for Rock/Contemporary Song of the Year for _Mirror_.      **Another Journal Entry**   Their second album, Another Journal Entry, was released on September 27, 2005. The first single from the album, _Let Go_, had already begun receiving airplay on Christian radio stations. Their next single from this album, _I Need You to Love Me_, has also received recent some airplay on some Christian radio stations after the album’s debut. The album debuted at #3 on Soundscan’s Christian album chart, and, as of Oct. 10, is at 85 on Billboards Top 200 Current Albums chart. The trio was nominated for three additional 2006 GMA (Gospel Music Association) awards: Group of the Year, Rock/Contemporary Album of the Year, and and Rock Recorded Song of the Year for _Let Go_.
