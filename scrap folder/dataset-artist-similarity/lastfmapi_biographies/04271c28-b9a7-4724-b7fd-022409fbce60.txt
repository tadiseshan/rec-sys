Herbert Jay Solomon (April 16, 1930 – July 1, 2003), better known as Herbie Mann, was an American jazz flautist who had an interest in traditional music of other cultures.      Herbie Mann was born in Brooklyn, New York. Early in his career, he played saxophone and clarinet, but Mann was among the first jazz musicians to specialize on the flute and was perhaps jazz music’s preminent flautist during the 1960s.      Mann was quite prolific and performed often. His first gig was playing in the Catskills at age 15. His last, on May 3, 2003 was at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival at age 73. Herbie Mann died at age 73 on July 1, 2003 of prostate cancer.
