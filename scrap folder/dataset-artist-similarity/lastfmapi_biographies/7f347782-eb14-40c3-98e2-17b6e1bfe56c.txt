[Paul David Hewson](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+David+Hewson) (born May 10, 1960), nicknamed [Bono Vox](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bono+Vox) \- stage name Bono - is the lead singer of the Irish rock band [U2](http://www.last.fm/music/U2).      Bono has been lead singer of the band U2 since 1976. U2 has won 22 Grammy Awards to date, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. Lauded by fans and critics as an outstanding performer and songwriter, Bono has also been praised by world leaders as an accomplished activist due to his powers of persuasion and knowledge of the issues. He travels extensively to give speeches and lobby politicians. Bono’s career as a socially conscious musician has been shaped by childhood experiences in Ireland (his father Bobby was Catholic and his mother Iris was a Protestant) as well as volunteer work in Africa and South America. He married his childhood sweetheart Alison Stewart in 1982. An accomplished activist in her own right, Ali Hewson once declined an invitation to run for President of Ireland because her husband “would not move to a smaller house”. They live in Dublin with their four children: Jordan, Memphis Eve, Elijah Bob Patricius Guggi Q (you couldn’t make it up!), and John Abraham.
