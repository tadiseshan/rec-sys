He later studied at the University of Pennsylvania where he came under the tutelage of George Crumb. He also gained a greater familiarity with classical music in this period and worked at clubs in Philadelphia.      He played professionally after 1981 and by 1985 had his recording debut with the Rochester-Gerald Veasley band. In the 1980s he moved to New York City where he lives now. He also appeared on a klezmer album with Mickey Katz and played with Don Byron.      His classical training led him toward an homage to Gustav Mahler which won a “Best Mahler album” award. He has also taken on Bach and Wagner.
