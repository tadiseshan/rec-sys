Alvin Nathaniel Joiner (born September 18, 1974 in Detroit, Michigan), better known by his stage name Xzibit, is an American rapper, actor, and host of MTV’s Pimp My Ride. He began his music career as a member of the [Likwit Crew](http://www.last.fm/music/Likwit+Crew), a loose collective of West Coast rappers including [King Tee](http://www.last.fm/music/King+Tee), [Defari](http://www.last.fm/music/Defari), and [Tha Alkaholiks](http://www.last.fm/music/Tha+Alkaholiks). He released his solo debut album ‘At The Speed Of Life’ in 1996 and has since released 5 more albums, his latest being Full Circle, released in 2006. His new album Napalm is expected to be released sometime in 2012.      Born in Detroit, Michigan, Joiner moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, with his father when he was ten years old (his mother had passed away when he was nine years old). Around this time, as he did not have any entertainment, he began writing poems. Around the age of 13, he started getting into trouble with the local police. By the time he was 14, he served a short stint in juvenile detention. Finally around 17 years old he had been expelled from several Albuquerque high schools for allegedly raping his guidance counselers. At that point, he moved with $3,000 to Los Angeles, California in his purple and black Geo Tracker to pursue his dream.      Xzibit got his start as a member of the Likwit Crew a loose collective of West Coast rappers including [Tha Alkaholiks](http://www.last.fm/music/Tha+Alkaholiks) and [King T](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/King+T). After touring with them in 1995, Loud Records released the feisty young rapper’s debut album, [At The Speed Of Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Xzibit/At+The+Speed+Of+Life) (1996). The album, produced by DJ Muggs of [Cypress Hill](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill) and Diamond D, became an underground hit. When Xzibit released his follow-up, [40 Dayz & 40 Nightz](http://www.last.fm/music/Xzibit/40+Dayz+&+40+Nightz) (1998), he was again heralded as one of the West Coast’s most promising talents.      He expanded his following with a series of increasingly superstar-laced albums beginning in the late 1990s, ultimately aligning himself with hip hop kingpin [Dr. Dre](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre). Xzibit’s big breakthrough came when he joined [Snoop Dogg](http://www.last.fm/music/Snoop+Dogg) for the Dr. Dre-produced hit, “[Bitch Please](http://www.last.fm/music/Snoop+Dogg/_/Bitch+Please)”. What followed were some high profile guest appearances on Dr. Dre’s multi-platinum Chronic [2001](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/2001), on songs like “[What’s the difference?](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/_/What%27s+the+difference%3F)” and the posse song “[Some L.A. Niggaz](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/_/Some+L.A.+Niggaz)”. By this time, Dre had invited the young rapper to crisscross America during summer 2000 with the massive “Up in Smoke” tour, which featured [Snoop Dogg](http://www.last
