[1] **Courtney Love** (born Courtney Michelle Harrison on July 9, 1964) is the lead singer, lyricist, and rhythm guitarist for the alternative rock band [Hole](http://www.last.fm/music/Hole). Love is also a solo artist, an occasional model and actress. Love was born in San Francisco, California to psychotherapist Linda Carroll and Hank Harrison, a short-lived manager for [The Grateful Dead](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Grateful+Dead).      Love began her professional music career with a brief stint as the lead singer of [Faith No More](http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+More) in the 1982. Shortly, she was kicked out of the band, due to the band wanting a male singer. Three years later, she formed an all-female pop-rock band called Sugar Babydoll with [Kat Bjelland](http://www.last.fm/music/Kat+Bjelland) and Jennifer Finch, and later - also with Bjelland - the [Pagan Babies](http://www.last.fm/music/Pagan+Babies). Love had greater early success as an actress, appearing as the best friend of Nancy Spungen in Alex Cox’s Sid Vicious biopic _Sid and Nancy_ in 1986, and in Cox’s _Straight to Hell_ in 1987, as well as small roles on television episodes.      Returning to music in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Love claims she co-founded the all-female rock band Babes in Toyland with Kat Bjelland in 1987, but others deny it;. Acrimony between Love and Bjelland led to Love’s quick exit from the band. The band’s biographer claims she stole house receipts to a Butthole Surfers concert. In 1989, Love formed her own band, Hole, with guitarist Eric Erlandson. The band’s 1991 debut album garnered little critical or popular attention in the United States but was celebrated in the influential British alternative-music press. Already a star in England, Hole’s fortunes improved considerably wtih Love’s marriage to Kurt Cobain and the publicity about Cobain’s death.      Unpopular with some [Nirvana](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana) fans (comparisons to Yoko Ono were made early on and persist to this day), Love’s image was further tarnished by a 1992 article in Vanity Fair entitled “Strange Love,” in which she admitted to using heroin in the early stages of pregnancy. As a result, Child Welfare Services briefly investigated the Cobains’ fitness as parents. Love claims to this day that she was misquoted, saying she had told author Lynn Hirschberg that she had stopped using it once she learned she was pregnant.      Like Axl Rose, Love was ridiculed in the press for her abrasive, sometimes erratic behavior, such as cursing at paparazzi and publicly harassing Cobain’s former girlfriend, folksinger Mary Lou Lord.      Shortly before the release of Hole’s breakthrough album _[Live Through This](http://www.last.fm/music/Hole/Live+Through+This)_ in April 1994, Cobain committed suicide. Love read his suicide note at a televised memorial a few days later, sobbing hysterically and alternately cursing her husband as a “fucking asshole” and pleading with him to come back
