Freddie Hubbard (Frederick Dewayne Hubbard, Indianapolis, Indiana, April 7, 1938 - Sherman Oaks, California, December 29, 2008) was an American jazz trumpeter.      Hubbard was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and associated in his youth with various musicians in Indianapolis, including [Wes Montgomery](http://www.last.fm/music/Wes+Montgomery) and Montgomery’s brothers. [Chet Baker](http://www.last.fm/music/Chet+Baker) was an early influence, although Hubbard soon aligned himself with the approach of [Clifford Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/Clifford+Brown) (and his forebears: [Fats Navarro](http://www.last.fm/music/Fats+Navarro) and [Dizzy Gillespie](http://www.last.fm/music/Dizzy+Gillespie)).   Hubbard’s jazz career began in earnest after moving to New York City in 1958. While there, he worked with [Sonny Rollins](http://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+Rollins), [Slide Hampton](http://www.last.fm/music/Slide+Hampton), [J. J. Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/J.+J.+Johnson), [Philly Joe Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Philly+Joe+Jones), [Oliver Nelson](http://www.last.fm/music/Oliver+Nelson), and [Quincy Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Quincy+Jones), among others. He gained attention while playing with the seminal [hard bop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20bop) ensemble [Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers](http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Blakey+&+The+Jazz+Messengers), appearing on such albums as Mosaic, Buhaina’s Delight, and Free For All. He left the Messengers in 1964 to lead his own groups and from that time maintained a high profile as a bandleader or featured as a special guest, but never merely a sideman.   Along with two other trumpeters also born in 1938, [Lee Morgan](http://www.last.fm/music/Lee+Morgan) (d. 1971) and [Booker Little](http://www.last.fm/music/Booker+Little) (d. 1961), Hubbard exerted a strong force on the direction of 1960s jazz. He recorded extensively for [Blue Note Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Blue+Note/): eight albums as a bandleader, and twenty-eight as a sideman. Most of these recordings are regarded as classics. Hubbard appeared on a few early [avant- garde](http://www.last.fm/tag/avant-garde) landmarks ([Ornette Coleman](http://www.last.fm/music/Ornette+Coleman)’s Free Jazz, [Eric Dolphy](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Dolphy)’s Out to Lunch and [John Coltrane](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane)’s Ascension), but Hubbard never fully embraced [free jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/free%20jazz), though it did influence his playing.   After leaving Blue Note, Hubbard recorded for the Atlantic label and moved toward a more commercial style. His next label was CTI Records where he recorded his best-known works, Red Clay, First Light, and Sky Dive. By 1970, his fiery, melodic improvisation and phenomenal technique established him as perhaps the leading trumpeter of his day, but a series of commercially oriented [smooth jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/smooth%20jazz) albums spawned some negative criticism
