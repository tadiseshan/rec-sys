Suzy Bogguss (born December 30, 1956) is an American country music singer and one of the most acclaimed female country singers of the 1980s and 90s. Her résumé includes the Academy of Country Music’s award for Top New Female Vocalist, the Country Music Association’s Horizon Award, six top ten singles, one platinum album, and three gold albums.      After taking a brief recording hiatus in the mid-1990s to start a family with her husband, songwriter Doug Crider, Bogguss returned to the country music scene to find that her charting power had already faded. Although she last appeared on the Billboard Hot Country Singles Chart in 1999, Bogguss continues to record and perform around the country to a loyal following.      Her most recent recordings have ventured into swing and jazz variations of country. These albums really showcase the tremendous talent in her voice. Suzy is a true singer, and her voice has so much versatility.   In 2014, Suzy added an album of Merle Haggard songs entitled “Lucky”. The country & western flavor dominates this album, unlike some of her other recent work. To promote this new album, Suzy has embarked on a nationwide tour.
