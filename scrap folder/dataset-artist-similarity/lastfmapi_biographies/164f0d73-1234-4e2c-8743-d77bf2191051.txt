Kanye Omari West (born June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia) is a Grammy award winning rapper, producer, author, designer and singer.      He began making beats and rapping in the early 90s in Chicago, IL, United States when he formed the rap group [Go Getters](http://www.last.fm/music/Go+Getters) with Chicago natives [GLC](http://www.last.fm/music/GLC) and [Really Doe](http://www.last.fm/music/Really+Doe). He later gained nationwide popularity in New York when he began producing tracks for artists such as [Jay-Z](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay-Z), [Twista](http://www.last.fm/music/Twista), [Mase](http://www.last.fm/music/Mase), [Talib Kweli](http://www.last.fm/music/Talib+Kweli) and [Alicia Keys](http://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys).      West’s style of production often utilizes pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul songs, with his own drums and instruments. The first major label song he produced was [The Truth](http://www.last.fm/music/Beanie+Sigel/_/The+Truth) by [Beanie Sigel](http://www.last.fm/music/Beanie+Sigel), and his first major release featuring his trademark vocal sampling style was [This Can’t Be Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay-Z/_/This+Can%E2%80%99t+Be+Life), a track from Jay-Z’s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West said he sped up the drum beat of [Dr. Dre](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre)’s [Xxplosive](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/_/Xxplosive) to use as a replacement for his drums on This Can’t Be Life.      West has said that [Wu-Tang Clan](http://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan) producer [RZA](http://www.last.fm/music/RZA) influenced him in his style, and has said on numerous occasions that Wu-Tang rappers [Ghostface Killah](http://www.last.fm/music/Ghostface+Killah) and [Ol’ Dirty Bastard](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ol%E2%80%99+Dirty+Bastard) were some of his all-time favorites. Said by Kanye West: “Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time… We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the [production] style I use, RZA has been doing that.”      In 2004 (after being pushed aside by many record companies who felt he wasn’t a marketable hip hop artist), he managed to release his debut solo album, [The College Dropout](http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/The+College+Dropout) on [Roc-a-Fella Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Roc-a-Fella+Records). The album received critical acclaim, defining the style for which West would become known: “wordplay” and heavy sampling of 70s [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) and [rnb](http://www.last.fm/tag/rnb) tracks. He is also known for his politically-charged rhymes and controversial behavior both inside and outside the realms of music.      He has since released five more albums, all of which have received numerous awards, high commercial success and critical acclaim.
