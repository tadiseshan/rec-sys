Bubba Sparxxx (born Warren Anderson Mathis on March 6, 1977, in LaGrange, Georgia) is an American rapper. Sparxxx is most notable for his hit singles “Ms. New Booty”, “Ugly” and “Deliverance”, and for being one of the few white rappers to find mainstream commercial success in hip hop.      A native of LaGrange, Georgia, a young Andy Mathis was introduced to hip hop music by a neighbor (his closest at a half mile away) who received mixed tapes mailed from New York City. He began recording with Lil Devil in a group called One Card Shi in 1996, but the partnership did not last. A subsequent release saw some success in Georgia, and the album Dark Days, Bright Nights caught the attention of Jimmy Iovine of Interscope Records. He signed to Interscope after a bidding war and began working with record producers Timbaland and Organized Noize. The major-label version of Dark Days, Bright Nights, which now included five collaborations with Timbaland and two with Organized Noize, debuted at #3 on the Billboard Music Charts. In late 2003, he returned with his sophomore album, Deliverance.      He is currently signed to OutKast’s Purple Ribbon Label, distributed through Virgin Records.      Bubba is also related to Haystak.      Albums   Dark Days, Bright Nights (2001) [Gold]   Deliverance (2003) [Gold]   The Charm (2006)
