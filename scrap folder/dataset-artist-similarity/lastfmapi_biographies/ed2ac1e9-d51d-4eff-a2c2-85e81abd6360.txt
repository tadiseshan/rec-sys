Bob Marley (February 6, 1945 – May 11, 1981), born Nesta Robert Marley which was later to be changed by passport officials to Robert Nesta Marley, was a [Jamaican](http://www.last.fm/place/jamaica) [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), guitarist, and activist. He was the most widely known writer and performer of [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae), and more specifically [roots reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/roots%20reggae). He is famous for popularising the genre outside of Jamaica and the [Caribbean](http://www.last.fm/tag/caribbean). Much of his music dealt with the struggles of the spiritually wealthy [rasta](http://www.last.fm/tag/rasta) and/or spiritually powerful Jah Rastafari.      Starting out in 1963 with the group [Bob Marley & The Wailers](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&+The+Wailers), he forged a distinctive song-writing and vocal style that would later resonate with audiences worldwide.      [The Wailers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Wailers) would go on to release some of the earliest [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae) records with producer [Lee Scratch Perry](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Lee+Scratch+Perry).      After [The Wailers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Wailers) disbanded in 1974, Marley pursued a solo career which culminated in the release of the album [Exodus](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&+The+Wailers/Exodus) in 1977 which established his worldwide reputation and became one of the world’s best- selling artists of all time, with sales of more than 75 million albums and singles.      Bob Marley was a member of this Rastafari movement, whose culture was a key element in the development of [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae). Bob Marley became the leading proponent of the Rastafari, taking their music out of socially deprived areas of [Jamaica](http://www.last.fm/place/jamaica) and onto the international music scene.      Now considered a “[rasta](http://www.last.fm/tag/rasta)” prophet, Marley’s adoption of the characteristic Rastafarian dreadlocks and famous use of marijuana as a sacred sacrament in the late sixties were an integral part of his persona. He is said to have entered every performance proclaiming the divinity of Jah Rastafari.      A few months before his death, Marley was baptised into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and took the name Berhane Selassie (meaning the Light of the Holy Trinity in Amharic).      His best known songs are a mixture of [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae), [roots reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/roots%20reggae), and [rhythm and blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/rhythm%20and%20blues), which include:      [I Shot The Sheriff](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&+The+Wailers/_/I+Sho t+The+Sheriff)   [Exodus](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&+The+Wailers/_/Exodus)   [Could You Be Loved](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&+The+Wailers/_/Could+You+Be+Loved)   [Redemption Song](http://www.last
