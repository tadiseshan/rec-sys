**The Faders** were a British three-piece female [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band with a [punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk) image. The group formed in early 2004 and released their debut single in March 2005, “[No Sleep Tonight](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Faders/_/No+Sleep+Tonight)” (also known as “[No Sleep 2nite](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Faders/_/No+Sleep+2nite)”), which charted at #13 in the official UK music charts. The lead singer of the band, Molly Lorenne (real name Molly Ure) was born on 7 March 1987.      Her father is [Midge Ure](http://www.last.fm/music/Midge+Ure) of [Thin Lizzy](http://www.last.fm/music/Thin+Lizzy) and [Ultravox](http://www.last.fm/music/Ultravox) fame. Toy Valentine, the band’s bassist and backing singer, began playing in it at age 20 and her birthday is 4 July. She also plays guitar and keyboards. Her father is a renowned [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) guitarist from Stoke Hammond.      Cherisse Osei, the Faders’ backing singer and drummer, began at age 18, born 23 December. According to herself, she “stands out due to her dimples”. Her dad, Eddie Osei, is an actor and has starred in films such as ‘Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist’.      Though their first single did well, being also included in the [soundtrack](http://www.last.fm/tag/soundtrack) to ‘The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants’, the group became sadly saddled with the tag of being a ‘[one hit wonder](http://www.last.fm/tag/one%20hit%20wonder)’. The band have now gone their separate ways, having split in 2006. Molly has since signed a solo deal under the name of [Molly McQueen](http://www.last.fm/music/Molly+McQueen), her first single being a re- release of ‘[No Sleep Tonight](http://www.last.fm/music/Molly+McQueen/_/No+Sleep+Tonight).’ Cherisse has drummed for singer-songwriter [Mika](http://www.last.fm/music/Mika).
