**Alex Chilton** (Memphis, Tennessee, December 28, 1950 – New Orleans, Louisiana, March 17, 2010) was an American songwriter, guitarist, singer and producer best known for his work with the pop-music bands [The Box Tops](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Box+Tops) and [Big Star](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Star). Chilton’s early commercial sales success in the 1960s as a teen vocalist for [The Box Tops](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Box+Tops) was not repeated in later years with [Big Star](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Star) and in his [indie](http://www.last.fm/tag/indie) music solo career on small labels like Last Call Records, New Rose, Razor and Tie, Bar/None, and others, but he did draw a loyal following in the [indie](http://www.last.fm/tag/indie) and [alternative](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative) music fields.      Chilton said in the September 1994 issue of _Guitar Player_ that he considers himself a “musical performer, not a songwriter” and that some of his songs sound only “half-baked” to him. Nonetheless, his compositions have been performed by a number of artists, including [Teenage Fanclub](http://www.last.fm/music/Teenage+Fanclub), [This Mortal Coil](http://www.last.fm/music/This+Mortal+Coil), [The Bangles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bangles), [Wilco](http://www.last.fm/music/Wilco), [Graham Coxon](http://www.last.fm/music/Graham+Coxon), [Garbage](http://www.last.fm/music/Garbage), [Tom Bradbury](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Bradbury), [Son Volt](http://www.last.fm/music/Son+Volt), [Counting Crows](http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows), [Elliott Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith), [Jeff Buckley](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley), [Superdrag](http://www.last.fm/music/Superdrag), [Evan Dando](http://www.last.fm/music/Evan+Dando), [Cat Power](http://www.last.fm/music/Cat+Power), [Yo La Tengo](http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo), [Placebo](http://www.last.fm/music/Placebo), [Xiu Xiu](http://www.last.fm/music/Xiu+Xiu), and [His Name Is Alive](http://www.last.fm/music/His+Name+Is+Alive). [The Replacements](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Replacements) wrote the song [Alex Chilton](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Replacements/_/Alex+Chilton) in his honor on their 1987 [Pleased to Meet Me](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Replacements/Pleased+to+Meet+Me) album, produced by [Jim Dickinson](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Dickinson) in Memphis.
