Born Montgomery Bernard Alexander on June 6, 1944 in Kingston, Jamaica, Monty Alexander is a jazz pianist whose style is influenced by strong Caribbean and swing feeling. A musician of a great versatility, this piano virtuoso has covered wide range of musical genres in his career from jazz to reggae, playing with either small bands or an orchestra. “My goal is to uplift”, says Alexander. “The piano, to me, is a vehicle for connecting to other human beings. I’m very open to all forms of music. I’m not a bebop musician, I’m not a calypso musician, I’m not a reggae musician. I’m a musician who loves it all”.
