Vivian Green (born 1979) is an American R&B singer, songwriter, and pianist.      Green was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and took an interest in singing, playing the piano, and songwriting at a very young age. At the age of thirteen, she became a member of a female quintet called Younique. Green received her big break at the age of nineteen when she became a backing singer for Jill Scott, who took her on an international tour. She was signed to Columbia Records in November 2001. Green released her first album, featuring the hit “Emotional Rollercoaster”, in November 2002 in the U.S. and February 2003 in the United Kingdom. Her second album, featuring the first single “Gotta Go, Gotta Leave (Tired)”, was released almost three years later, in June 2005. Green was engaged to Erik Tribbet, a drummer from nearby Camden, New Jersey, with whom she has a son named Jordan.
