Klaus Wunderlich (born June 18, 1931 in Chemnitz, Saxony, Germany — died October 28, 1997 at Engen in the Hegau near Lake Constance, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) was a German musician.      Wunderlich played the Hammond organ and created his own electronic sound. He was open to different music styles and played classic, operetta, musical as well as popular music. He sold more than 20 million records all over the world and received 13 golden albums. He has something of a cult following, and pops up from time to time in the playlists of contemporary dj’s. Some of his work is very kitsch, some downright silly, and you will find him in dollar bins the world over. The sounds he created on the keyboard are very catchy and get one “going”.      Recorded at least one album under the alias [Chris Waxman](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Waxman) for Western audiences.
