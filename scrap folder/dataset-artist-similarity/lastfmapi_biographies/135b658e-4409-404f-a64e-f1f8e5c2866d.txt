**Davy Spillane** is a player of the uilleann (Irish) pipes and the low whistle. Born in 1959, he began his musical career at the age of 16, but didnâ€™t begin releasing studio albums until 1988 with his debut album **Atlantic Bridge**. Shortly after its release he formed the **Davy Spillane Band** under which name he released **Out of the Air**, a departure from much of his solo work in that it maintained a traditional feel but was heavily influenced by **blues** and **rock**, including several guest performances from the legendary guitarist **Rory Gallagher**. The band featured heavily in the albums which followed Out Of The Air, including **Shadow Hunter** and **Pipedreams**. In 1993 he was signed by **Sony** and released several albums with a more ambient feel including **A Place Among The Stones** which brought him more mainstream critical acclaim.
