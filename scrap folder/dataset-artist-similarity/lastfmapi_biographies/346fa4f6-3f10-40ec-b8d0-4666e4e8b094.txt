Loleatta Holloway (November 5, 1946 – March 21, 2011) was an American singer, mainly known for disco songs such as “[Hit and Run](http://www.last.fm/music/Loleatta+Holloway/_/Hit+and+Run)” and “[Love Sensation](http://www.last.fm/music/Loleatta+Holloway/_/Love+Sensation)”, both of which have been sampled extensively.      She began [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel) singing with her mother in the Holloway Community Singers and she has also recorded with Albertina Walker in The Caravans gospel group. Holloway was also a cast member of the Chicago troupe of Don’t Bother Me I Can’t Cope.      Holloway found moderate [disco](http://www.last.fm/tag/disco) success when she placed eighteen songs on the Hot [dance](http://www.last.fm/tag/dance) Music/Club Play chart, including four Number ones, and was featured on [Dan Hartman](http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Hartman)’s disco classic, “[Vertigo / Relight My Fire](http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Hartman/_/Vertigo+%2F+Relight+My+Fire)”. In the early 1980s, she had another dance hit with “[Crash Goes Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Loleatta+Holloway/_/Crash+Goes+Love)”, before she had her first Number one in the UK with “[Ride On Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Box/_/Ride+On+Time)” by [Black Box](http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Box), which featured vocal samples from her own Salsoul recording, “[Love Sensation](http://www.last.fm/music/Loleatta+Holloway/_/Love+Sensation)”. This happened again in 1991 when [Marky Mark and The Funky Bunch](http://www.last.fm/music/Marky+Mark+and+The+Funky+Bunch) featured her vocals in the chart topping cover version of the song “[Good Vibrations](http://www.last.fm/music/Loleatta+Holloway/_/Good+Vibrations)”. Although both songs were notorious for initial copyright infringements (see: white label), they did help elevate Holloway to legendary status in the dance music/disco community.      A more recent dance chart entry was “Relight My Fire” (credited to Martin featuring Loleatta Holloway), which hit #5 in 2003.      Her latest hit “[Love Sensation ‘06](http://www.last.fm/music/Loleatta+Holloway/_/Love+Sensation+%2706)” peaked at #22 in the Dutch Top 40[1] and reached #37 on the UK Singles Chart as well as #49 in [Australia](http://www.last.fm/place/Australia).      Holloway died on March 21, 2011 from heart failure. She was 64 years old. She is survived by her four children.
