Buffy Sainte-Marie (born 20 February 1941) is an Academy Award-winning Canadian First Nations musician, composer, visual artist, educator and social activist.      She was born on the Piapot Cree reserve in the Qu’Appelle valley, Saskatchewan. She was later adopted and grew up in Maine and Massachusetts. She went on to earn a Ph.D. in Fine Arts from the University of Massachusetts and also holds degrees in both Oriental Philosophy and teaching.      By 1962, having graduated, Buffy began to tour alone, developing her craft and performing in various concert halls, folk festivals and Native reservations across the U.S, Canada and abroad. She spent a considerable amount of time in the coffeehouses of downtown Toronto’s old Yorkville district, and New York City’s Greenwich Village as part of the early to mid-1960s folk scene, often alongside other emerging Canadian contemporaries [Leonard Cohen](http://www.last.fm/music/Leonard+Cohen), [Joni Mitchell](http://www.last.fm/music/Joni+Mitchell) and [Neil Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young).      She quickly earned a reputation as a gifted songwriter, and many of her earliest songs, such as _Until It’s Time For You To Go_, were turned into hits by other artists including [Barbra Streisand](http://www.last.fm/music/Barbra+Streisand), [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley), [Sonny and Cher](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sonny+and+Cher), [Chet Atkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Chet+Atkins), [Roberta Flack](http://www.last.fm/music/Roberta+Flack), [Janis Joplin](http://www.last.fm/music/Janis+Joplin) and [Neil Diamond](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Diamond), among others.      Her debut album, _It’s My Way_, was released on Vanguard Records in 1964 and she was subsequently named Billboard Magazine’s Best New Artist. This album also contained the critically acclaimed protest song _Universal Soldier_ that later became a hit for Donovan.      In 1967 she released the album _Fire and Fleet and Candlelight_ which contained probably the definitive interpretation of the traditional song _Lyke Wake Dirge_, and the hit _Now that the Buffalo’s Gone_, a protest over broken treaties with First nations people. Sainte-Marie’s other well-known songs as a performer include _Mister Can’t You See_ (a Top 40 U.S. hit in 1972) and _He’s An Indian Cowboy In The Rodeo_.      In the late sixties, she used a Buchla synthesizer to record the album _Illuminations_, but it didn’t get much notice. “People were more in love with the Pocahontas-with-a-guitar image,” she said in a 1998 interview.      She married musician [Jack Nitzsche](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Nitzsche) in 1969, and regularly appeared on the children’s TV series _Sesame Street_ over a five year period from 1976 - 1981, with her son Dakota Starblanket Wolfchild.      The song _Up Where We Belong_ (which she co-wrote with [Will Jennings](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Jennings) and Jack Nitzsche) as performed by [Joe Cocker](http://www
