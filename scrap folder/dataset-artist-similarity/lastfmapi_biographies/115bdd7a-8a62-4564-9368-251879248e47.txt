**Sheila Chandra** (b. 1965) is a singer of Indian descent and British nationality.      Born on the 14th March 1965, as a teenager she formed the band [Monsoon](http://www.last.fm/music/Monsoon), and created a fusion of Western and Indian pop styles. She married [Steve Coe](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Coe), who became the band’s producer, and along with [Martin Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/Martin+Smith), the band became a trio. They made a single album, _Third Eye_, in 1982, from which they had a surprise hit single “Ever So Lonely”. However, resenting pressure from their record company over musical direction, Monsoon as a band dissolved and Coe and Smith set about promoting Chandra as a solo artist on an independent label.      Chandra went on to release a number of albums in the 1980s, experimenting with her voice as an instrument. In the 1990s she released three albums on Peter Gabriel’s Real World label, although Martin Smith ceased to be actively involved.      In 1996 she provided vocals for a cover of Prodigy’s hit “Smack My Bitch Up”. In 2002 she performed the song “Breath of Life” with [Howard Shore](http://www.last.fm/music/Howard+Shore) for the _Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_ soundtrack.      She is no longer able to record, having developed “burned mouth syndrome” in 2010, which makes speech and singing so painful that she is effectively mute.
