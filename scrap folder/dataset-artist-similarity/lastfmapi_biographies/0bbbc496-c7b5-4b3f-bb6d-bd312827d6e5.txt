**Roy Kelton Orbison** (April 23, 1936 – December 6, 1988), nicknamed “The Big O”, was an influential American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) and a pioneer of [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll), whose recording career spanned more than four decades. By the mid-1960s Orbison was internationally recognized for his ballads of lost love, rhythmically advanced melodies, three-octave vocal range, characteristic dark sunglasses, and sometimes distinctive usage of [falsetto](http://www.last.fm/tag/falsetto), typified in songs such as “[Only the Lonely](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Orbison/_/Only+the+Lonely), “[Oh, Pretty Woman](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Orbison/_/Oh,+Pretty+Woman)”, and “[Crying](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Orbison/_/Crying)”. In 1989, he was inducted posthumously into the National Academy of Popular Music/Songwriters Hall of Fame.      Two common misconceptions about his appearance stubbornly continue to surface about Orbison: one, that he was an albino, and two, that he wore his trademark dark glasses because he was blind or nearly so. Neither is correct, although his poor vision required him to wear thick corrective lenses (He suffered from childhood from a combination of hyperopia, severe astigmatism, presbyopia, anisometropia, and strabismus). Orbison’s trademark sunglasses were a fashion statement arising from an accident early in his career. Due to go onstage in a few minutes, Orbison left his regular glasses in an airplane. Unable to see without corrective lenses, the only other pair of glasses he had available were darkly tinted prescription sunglasses. “I had to see to get onstage,” so he wore the glasses throughout his tour with the Beatles, and he carried on with it for the rest of his professional career. “I’ll just do this and look cool.”      **Early life and career**      Orbison was born in Vernon, Texas, the second son of Nadine and Orbie Lee. After moving to Fort Worth around 1943 to find work in the munitions and aircraft factories expanded as a result of the Second World War, the family moved to the tiny oil town of Wink in late 1946. Music was an important part of his family life.      In 1949, at age 13, he organized his first band, “The Wink Westerners”, and when not singing with the band he spent his time playing guitar and writing songs. The band appeared weekly on KERB radio in Kermit, Texas. Orbison graduated from Wink High School in 1954. He attended North Texas State College in Denton, Texas for a year, and enrolled at Odessa Junior College in 1955 to study history and English. The Wink Westerners had some success on local television, being given 30 minute weekly shows on KMID and then KOSA. One of the guests on their show was Johnny Cash, who advised them to seek a contract with his record producer, Sam Phillips, of Sun Records
