**Georges Moustaki** (1934-2013) was a [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) of Greek Jewish origin.      Moustaki was born Yussef Mustacchi on the 3rd May 1934 in Alexandria, [Egypt](http://www.last.fm/place/Egypt), of Sephardic Jewish parents who had moved there from Corfu, and who ran a bookshop in the city. The family spoke Italian at home, but Georges (then Yussef) spoke Arabic with his friends and attended a French school to which his Frncophile parents sent him and his sisters. In 1951 he moved to Paris, where he was inspired by the young [Georges Brassens](http://www.last.fm/music/Georges+Brassens), in honour of whom he changed his name to Georges Moustaki.      Moustaki wrote and sang in French, Italian, Greek, Spanish, English, Yiddish, and Arabic. Early influences included [Edith Piaf](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Edith+Piaf), with whom Moustaki carried on a year-long romance. His pan-national approach to music made him a star in Europe in the late sixties and early seventies.      He died on the 23rd May 2013 in Nice, France.
