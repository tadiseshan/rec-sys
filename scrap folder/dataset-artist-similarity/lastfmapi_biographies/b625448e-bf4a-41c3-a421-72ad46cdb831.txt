**John William Coltrane** (Hamlet, North Carolina, September 23, 1926 – Huntington, New York, July 17, 1967) was an American [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) [saxophonist](http://www.last.fm/tag/saxophonist) and [composer](http://www.last.fm/tag/composer).      American jazz great John Coltrane emerged in the 19[50s](http://www.last.fm/tag/50s), playing tenor and soprano sax with [Dizzy Gillespie](http://www.last.fm/music/Dizzy+Gillespie), [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis) and [Thelonious Monk](http://www.last.fm/music/Thelonious+Monk). A leader of “[hard bop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20bop)”, in the 19[60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s) he led his own groups and changed the face of jazz with experimentation and improvisation, his later recordings reflecting his belief that music was a form of spiritual expression. Sometimes called simply ‘Trane, his recordings include _[Giant Steps](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane/Giant+Steps)_ (1959), _[My Favorite Things](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane/My+Favorite+Things)_ (1960), _[Olé](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane/Ol%C3%A9)_ (1961) and _[A Love Supreme](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane/A+Love+Supreme)_ (1964). In his later recordings he collaborated on avante-garde music with his wife, [Alice Coltrane](http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+Coltrane) (b. Alice McLeod, 1937-2007), who had a career in her own right.      The band sometimes called Coltrane’s “classic quartet” of the early 1960s included McCoy Tyner (piano), Elvin Jones (drums) and Jimmy Garrison (bass).   Despite a relatively brief career (he first came to notice as a sideman at age 29 in 1955, formally launched a solo career at 33 in 1960, and was dead at 40 in 1967), saxophonist John Coltrane was among the most important, and most controversial, figures in jazz. It seems amazing that his period of greatest activity was so short, not only because he recorded prolifically, but also because, taking advantage of his fame, the record companies that recorded him as a sideman in the 1950s frequently reissued those recordings under his name and there has been a wealth of posthumously released material as well. Since Coltrane was a protean player who changed his style radically over the course of his career, this has made for much confusion in his discography and in appreciations of his playing. There remains a critical divide between the adherents of his earlier, more conventional (if still highly imaginative) work and his later, more experimental work. No one, however, questions Coltrane’s almost religious commitment to jazz or doubts his significance in the history of the music.      Coltrane was the son of John R. Coltrane, a tailor and amateur musician, and Alice (Blair) Coltrane. Two months after his birth, his maternal grandfather, the Reverend William Blair, was promoted to presiding elder in the A.M.E
