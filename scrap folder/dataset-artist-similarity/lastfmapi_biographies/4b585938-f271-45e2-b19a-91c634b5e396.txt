**Kate Bush** (born Catherine Bush on 30 July 1958 in Welling, Kent, England, now part of Greater London) is an English singer and songwriter known for her expressive four-octave soprano voice, idiosyncratic and literary lyrics, and eclectic and meticulous musical and production style. She debuted in 1978 with the surprise hit _”[Wuthering Heights](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/_/Wuthering+Heights)”_, which was number one in the British music charts for four weeks and the first UK number one by female artist with a self-penned song. Kate will make again UK chart history in 2014 by becoming the first female to score eight albums on the UK Official Albums Chart simultaneously.      Whilst learning the violin and piano at St. Joseph’s Convent Grammar, she caught the ear of [Pink Floyd](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd)’s [David Gilmour](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Gilmour) who funded some demos, ultimately leading to a deal with [EMI](http://www.last.fm/label/EMI) (Pink Floyd’s ultimate record company through the progressive Harvest imprint) when she was sixteen. Over the next two years EMI allowed her to hone her talents to and to finish school without releasing any material—while maintaining an exclusive contract. Bush’s first releases were in 1978 with the single _Wuthering Heights_ (which went to number 1 in the UK) followed by the album _[The Kick Inside](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/The+Kick+Inside)_.      Even from her earliest works, featuring piano as a primary instrument, Bush wove together many diverse influences, melding [classical](http://www.last.fm/tag/classical) music, [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock), and a wide range of [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) sources, producing a unique amalgam which has continued throughout her career. Later recordings have moved farther from a rock base, however, notably with the release of _[The Dreaming](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/The+Dreaming)_ in 1982, where she experimented heavily with the then-new technology of sampling.      Recorded in the same sessions as Bush’s reworking of old material, _[Director’s Cut](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/Director%27s+Cut)_, [50 Words for Snow](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/50+Words+for+Snow) comprises seven songs “set against a background of falling snow.” The album was released through the singer’s personal imprint, Fish People, on November 21, 2011. It was Kate Bush’s 10th studio album.      Kate Bush has tackled sensitive and taboo subjects long before it had become fashionable to do so; _”[Kashka From Baghdad](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/_/Kashka+From+Baghdad)”_ is a song about a gay male couple; _”[Breathing](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/_/Breathing)”_ explores the results of nuclear fallout. Her lyrics are often literate and reference a wide array of subject matter, some of which is relatively obscure, such as Wilhelm Reich in _”[Cloudbusting](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/_/Cloudbusting)”_, or G
