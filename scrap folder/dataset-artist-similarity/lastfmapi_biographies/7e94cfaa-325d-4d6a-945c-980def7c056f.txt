Kevin Gilbert (November 20, 1966 - May 17, 1996) was an American musician, born in Sacramento, California. He died of autoerotic asphyxiation at the age of twenty-nine.      He was an accomplished instrumentalist and composer, who played keyboards, guitars, drums, bass and cellos, as well as singing vocals. His talents also extended to producer. He toured with Eddie Money before winning the Yamaha songwriting competition with his progressive rock group [Giraffe](http://www.last.fm/music/Giraffe). Producer [Patrick Leonard](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrick+Leonard) was impressed with Gilbert’s performance at the competition and invited him to join him in forming a new band which became [Toy Matinee](http://www.last.fm/music/Toy+Matinee). During this time, Gilbert worked on the projects of several established pop musicians, including [Madonna](http://www.last.fm/music/Madonna), [Michael Jackson](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson) and produced [Keith Emerson](http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Emerson)’s album [Changing States](http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Emerson/Changing+States).      The lone [Toy Matinee](http://www.last.fm/music/Toy+Matinee) album was released in 1990 but effectively shelved by the record company, so Gilbert assembled a new backing band to promote the album, eventually getting two successful singles released: “[The Ballad Of Jenny Ledge](http://www.last.fm/music/Toy+Matinee/_/The+Ballad+Of+Jenny+Ledge)” and “[Last Plane Out](http://www.last.fm/music/Toy+Matinee/_/Last+Plane+Out)”.      Later, Gilbert was part of a songwriting collective (called “The Tuesday Music Club”) that met at producer Bill Bottrell’s studio in Pasadena, California. After he began bringing his then girlfriend [Sheryl Crow](http://www.last.fm/music/Sheryl+Crow) to the sessions, the result was Crow’s debut album, [Tuesday Night Music Club](http://www.last.fm/music/Sheryl+Crow/Tuesday+Night+Music+Club). Gilbert co-wrote many of the songs on that album, including 1995 Grammy Record of the Year “All I Wanna Do.” Crow later acrimoniously split with most of the musicians in the collective and only Bottrell was involved in her follow-up album. Meanwhile the remainder of the collective worked with singer- songwriters Susanna Hoffs and Linda Perry on two more albums.      Gilbert continued to work in television and movie soundtrack work as well as studio work and producing and eventually released his first solo album [Thud](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Gilbert/Thud)(1995) as well as partially reforming [Giraffe](http://www.last.fm/music/Giraffe) to perform the [Genesis](http://www.last.fm/music/Genesis) masterpiece “[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway](http://www.last.fm/music/Genesis/The+Lamb+Lies+Down+on+Broadway)” at Progfest 94. Gilbert’s manager sent a copy of the recording to [Tony Banks](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Banks) and [Mike Rutherford](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Rutherford) who were searching for a new [Genesis](http://www.last
