Lokua Kanza is a singer, songwriter, and composer from the Democratic Republic of Congo (the greater Congo). He is known for his soulful, folksy sound, which is atypical of the dancefloor friendly soukous music that is common in Congo.      Lokua Kanza was born Pascal Lokua Kanza in 1958 in Bukavu, in the province of Kivu, in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. He is the eldest of eight children, with a Mongo father and a Tutsi mother from Rwanda. In 1964, the family went to live in Kinshasa (Congo’s capital) in a middle class area, until the day when Pascal’s father, a ship’s captain, died. His mother then moved to a much poorer area of the city, and Lokua, the eldest, had to work to feed the family. He therefore went to school part time, and took odd jobs, as well as singing in churches. Lokua Kanza sings in French, Lingala, and English.
