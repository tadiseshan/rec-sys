Shannon Wright is a powerhouse singer-songwriter from Atlanta, Georgia.      She fronted the rocktrio [Crowsdell](http://www.last.fm/music/Crowsdell) in the 90’s, recording two albums. “Dreamette” and “In the curve of an arm”. Both featuring her intense writing, playing and singing.      From her earlier and more gentle work Flight Safety (1999), to the vocally aggressive Dyed in the Wool (2001), Shannon has done an amazing amount of growth as a singer, songwriter, pianist and guitar player, and her work on Over the Sun stands as a document of those fully realized capabilities. Recorded with Steve Albini in Chicago at the end of 2003, these songs sound enormous, and the immediacy of’ the recording puts the listener closer to her than ever before. Over the Sun pours out of the speakers like Shannon is playing right there in your living room, belting out these songs from 10 feet away. This time, Shannon truly captures the feeling of her electric live performances. She’s a frequent road warrior, playing shows everywhere from South Dakota to Brazil. Her live shows are emotionally charged, unbridled pieces of rock and roll, featuring Shannon’s trademark vocal howl and multi- instrumental palette. Most recently, Shannon was handpicked by [Sleater- Kinney](http://www.last.fm/music/Sleater-Kinney) and [Nick Cave](http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Cave) to open some of their US tour dates.      Although they’ve been playing together for nearly two years now, Over The Sun is the first time Christina Files (Swirlies, Victory At Sea, Mary Timony) appears on a Shannon Wright recording. Christina lends her graceful drumming skills to the mix, creating an airy backdrop for Shannon to stretch out and play.      In 2007 she released “let in the light” .
