**Annie Lennox** is an Oscar, Brit and Grammy award-winning pop musician and vocalist. She was born on December 25, 1954 in Aberdeen, Scotland.      After three years as lead singer of [The Tourists](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Tourists), Lennox achieved her most notable fame as the alto, soul-tinged lead singer of the 1980s rock duo [Eurythmics](http://www.last.fm/music/Eurythmics) with British musician [Dave Stewart](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Stewart). Early in the Eurythmics’ career, she was known for her androgyny, wearing suits and once impersonating Elvis. Journalists often referred to her as “the white [Grace Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones)”.      Her 1992 album _Diva_ won critical praise and sold well, but her profile decreased for a period due to her desire to raise her two children outside of the media’s glare, although she continued to be a major figure in popular music. _Medusa_ \- an album of covers in which Lennox tackled songs by everyone from [Bob Marley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley) to [The Clash](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Clash) \- was released three years after _Diva_, and also sold well. In 1997 she re-recorded the Eurythmics track “Angel” for the Diana, Princess of Wales tribute album. In 1998 - following the death of a mutual friend (former The Tourists leader singer/songwriter Peet Coombes) - she re-established contact with Dave Stewart and by 1999, Eurythmics had reformed for the album _Peace_. In 2003 she released her third solo album, _Bare_.      In 2003, Lennox was chosen to record “Into the West” for the soundtrack of _The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King_. This song won an Academy Award for Best Song in 2003.      In October 2007, Annie released her fourth solo album, _Songs Of Mass Destruction_.
