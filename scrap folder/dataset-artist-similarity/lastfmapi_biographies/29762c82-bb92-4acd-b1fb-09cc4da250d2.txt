Joe “Satch” Satriani (born on July 15, 1956, in Westbury, New York and brought up in Carle Place, New York, USA) is an instrumental rock guitarist and teacher, and a recognized virtuoso of the rock guitar. Guitarists [Alex Skolnick](http://www.last.fm/music/Alex+Skolnick), [Larry Lalonde](http://www.last.fm/music/Larry+Lalonde), [Steve Vai](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Vai), [Charlie Hunter](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Hunter) and [Kirk Hammett](http://www.last.fm/music/Kirk+Hammett) were among his students. Satriani often tours as the guitar playing trio [G3](http://www.last.fm/music/G3), usually with [Steve Vai](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Vai).      Joe Satriani was inspired to play guitar at age 14 after hearing that [Jimi Hendrix](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix) had died. Satriani reportedly heard the news during a football training session where he immediately confronted his coach and announced that he was quitting to become a guitarist.      In 1974, he studied music with jazz guitarist [Billy Bauer](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Bauer) and with reclusive jazz pianist [Lennie Tristano](http://www.last.fm/music/Lennie+Tristano). The technically demanding Tristano greatly influenced Satriani’s playing. Satriani also began teaching guitar, with his most notable student, at this time, being fellow Long Island native Steve Vai.      In 1978 Satriani moved to Berkeley, California to pursue a music career. Not long after his arrival he resumed teaching. His most notable California students included: [Kirk Hammett](http://www.last.fm/music/Kirk+Hammett) (Metallica), [David Bryson](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bryson) (Counting Crows), [Kevin Cadogan](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Cadogan) (Third Eye Blind), [Larry Lalonde](http://www.last.fm/music/Larry+Lalonde) (Primus), [Alex Skolnick](http://www.last.fm/music/Alex+Skolnick) (Testament), Phil Kettner (Laaz Rockit) and [Charlie Hunter](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Hunter).      When his friend and former student Steve Vai gained fame playing with [David Lee Roth](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Lee+Roth) in 1986, Vai raved about Satriani in several interviews with guitar magazines. In 1987, Satriani’s second album Surfing With the Alien produced popular radio hits, and was the first all-instrumental release to chart so highly in many years. Satriani also toured Australia and New Zealand with Mick Jagger in support of the Rolling Stones singer’s solo album.      In 1989, Satriani released the album Flying in a Blue Dream. The album sold well, particularly in Texas. It was heavily promoted by KLBJ-FM in Austin. “One Big Rush” was featured on the soundtrack to the Cameron Crowe movie Say Anything. The song was also featured by the Dallas Stars’ as their entry song at every period. “The Forgotten Part II” was featured on a Labatt Blue commercial in Canada in 1993. “Big Bad Moon”, one of Satch’s few singles with personally sung vocals, was a minor hit in late 1989
