KMD was a rap group from the early 90s. The members include: Zev Love X (a.k.a. [MF DOOM](http://www.last.fm/music/MF+DOOM), [Viktor Vaughn](http://www.last.fm/music/Viktor+Vaughn) & [King Geedorah](http://www.last.fm/music/King+Geedorah)), Subroc (Zev Love X’s deceased brother), and Onyx The Birthstone Kid.      [KMD](http://www.last.fm/music/KMD) released their first album Mr.Hood on Elektra in 1991. A nearly impossible to find release (although since has been re-issued in Oct. 2006), Mr. Hood preached power and positivity, with obscure samples from Sesame Street found throughout the album, and saw future Metal- Faced-Villain Zev Love X in a uniquely different light. Two years later Subroc would be killed in a car accident forcing the promising MC, Zev Love X into the underground where he would later emerge as the tortured soul [MF DOOM](http://www.last.fm/music/MF+DOOM). With Onyx having left the group, controversial artwork by Zev, and Subroc’s unfortunate death, the release of their second lp “Bl_ck B_st_rds” seemed improbable and was shelved by Elektra fearing negative media coverage due to the recent ‘Cop Killer’ song by [Ice-T](http://www.last.fm/music/Ice-T)’s group Body Count. The cover art for the album had sparked worries in Elektra’s board room. After years of bootlegs, “Bl_ck B_st_rds” finally saw the light of day in 2001 on the Subverse record label.
