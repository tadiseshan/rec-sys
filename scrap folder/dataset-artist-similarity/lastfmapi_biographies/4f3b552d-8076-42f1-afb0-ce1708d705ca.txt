Instrumentalist: sax      Steven Eugene Grove (born November 27, 1962) , better known as Euge Groove, is an American smooth jazz saxophonist with a strong Top-40 background.      Born in Annapolis, Maryland, he graduated from the University of Miami School of Music in 1984. A rather late-bloomer in the genre, Grove did not record his first solo album until 2000. Prior to that, he had replaced [Richard Elliot](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Elliot) in the [Tower of Power](http://www.last.fm/music/Tower+of+Power) when Elliot decided to pursue a solo career, and he also did session work with various pop acts, most noticeably the Miami girl group [Exposé](http://www.last.fm/music/Expos%C3%A9). He has a sax solo on their #1 hit “Seasons Change,” and another on their 1993 hit “I’ll Never Get Over You (Getting Over Me).”      Grove adopted the name Euge Groove, which consists of a shortening of his middle name and a very frequent mispronunciation of his last. While initially it was presumed to be coined by fans who saw him perform in Europe, Grove later indicated in an interview on XM Radio during the summer of 2006 that his Mother-in-Law conceived the idea for his stage name.      Euge Groove’s best-known solo hits include “[Sneak A Peek (Album Version)](htt p://www.last.fm/music/Euge+Groove/_/Sneak+A+Peek+\(Album+Version\)),” “Slam Dunk,” “Rewind,” “Livin’ Large” and “XXL.” His most recent hits include “Get ‘Em Going” and “Chillaxin’.” Solid albums include; Livin’ Large (2004) and Play Date (2002).
