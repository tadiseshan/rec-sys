Mari Boine is a [sami](http://www.last.fm/tag/sami) musician from Norway known for having added [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) and [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) to the “yoiks”(Sami traditional music) of her native people. Boine (born 8 November 1956 in Finnmark, Norway) grew up amid the Laestadian Christian movement as well as amidst discrimination against her people. She was asked to perform at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, but refused because she perceived the invitation as an attempt to bring a token minority to the ceremonies. Gula Gula (1989, Real World) was her breakthrough release, and she has continued to record popular albums.
