Dave Holland (born October 1, 1946) is a British [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) [bassist](http://www.last.fm/tag/bassist) and [composer](http://www.last.fm/tag/composer) who is a significant representative of [avant-garde jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/avant- garde%20jazz).      Born in Wolverhampton, England, Holland learned to play bass as a child, and spent three years studying the instrument at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. By 1967 he was a regular player at [Ronnie Scott](http://www.last.fm/music/Ronnie+Scott)’s, the premier jazz club in London, backing visiting musicians. He was also involved in the London [free improvisation](http://www.last.fm/tag/free%20improvisation) scene around the drummer [John Stevens](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Stevens), and performed on the [Spontaneous Music Ensemble](http://www.last.fm/music/Spontaneous+Music+Ensemble)’s classic 1968 album [Karyobin](http://www.last.fm/music/Spontaneous+Music+Ensemble/Karyobin). That same year, [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis) and [Philly Joe Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Philly+Joe+Jones) heard him playing at Ronnie Scott’s, and Jones told Holland that Davis wanted him to join his band (replacing [Ron Carter](http://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Carter)). Davis left the UK before Holland could contact him directly, and two weeks later Holland was given three days’ notice to fly to New York for an engagement at [Count Basie](http://www.last.fm/music/Count+Basie)’s nightclub. He arrived the night before, staying with [Jack DeJohnette](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+DeJohnette), a previous acquaintance. The following day [Herbie Hancock](http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock) took him to the club, and his two years with Davis began. This was also Hancock’s last gig as Davis’s pianist, as he left afterwards for a honeymoon in [Brazil](http://www.last.fm/place/Brazil) and was replaced by Chick Corea when he couldn’t return for an engagement due to illness. Holland’s first recordings with Davis were in September 1968, for half of the album [Filles De Kilimanjaro](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/Filles+De+Kilimanjaro) (with Davis, Corea, [Wayne Shorter](http://www.last.fm/music/Wayne+Shorter) and [Tony Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Williams)).      Holland was a member of Davis’s rhythm section through the summer of 1970; he appears on the albums [In A Silent Way](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/In+A+Silent+Way) and [Bitches Brew](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/Bitches+Brew). All three of his studio recordings with Davis were instrumental in the evolution of [jazz fusion](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20fusion). In the first year of his tenure with Davis, Holland played primarily acoustic bass. By the end of 1969, he played electric bass guitar (often treated with wah-wah and other electronic effects) with increasing frequency as Davis’s music became increasingly electronic, vamp-based and funky
