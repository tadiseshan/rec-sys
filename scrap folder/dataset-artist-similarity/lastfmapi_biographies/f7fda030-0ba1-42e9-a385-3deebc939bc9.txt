Santana became famous in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his band, [Santana](http://www.last.fm/music/Santana), which pioneered rock, salsa and jazz fusion. The band’s sound featured his melodic, blues-based guitar lines set against Latin and African rhythms. Santana continued to work in these forms over the following decades. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine listed Santana at number 15 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. He has won 10 Grammy Awards and 3 Latin Grammy Awards.      Santana has was an avenue named after him as well as a statue of a guitar in the city where he was born (born in Autlán de Navarro, Jalisco, México) to honour him. The family moved from there to Tijuana In La Calonia Libertad, the city on Mexico’s border with California, and then San Francisco, USA. Carlos stayed in Tijuana but joined his family in San Francisco later and graduated from James Lick Middle School and Mission High School there.      Most of his musical career has been spent with [Santana](http://www.last.fm/music/Santana), the band he formed in San Francisco in 1967. His music underwent large changes in 1973 when he was introduced to the spiritual leader Sri Chinmoy, by fellow guitarist “Mahavishnu” John McLaughlin. After this he adopted the title “Devadip” which he still uses. In 1998 he formed the Milagro Foundation along with his wife Deborah, which supports disadvantaged children. Later Carlos and Deborah divorced, but the Milagro Foundation is still alive and well.      Other huge influences of Carlos Santana are both [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis) (with whom he maintained a big personal connection), and [John Coltrane](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane), who unfortunately passed away in 1967.
