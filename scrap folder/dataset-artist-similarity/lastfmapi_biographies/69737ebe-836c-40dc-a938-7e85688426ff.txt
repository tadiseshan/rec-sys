Alain Souchon (born May 27, 1944, Casablanca, Morocco) is a French pop singer, songwriter and actor. He has released 15 albums and has played roles in seven films.      Souchon signed his first contract in 1971, but had no success until he began to collaborate with composer/arranger [Laurent Voulzy](http://www.last.fm/music/Laurent+Voulzy) ; they would write together, but each released albums under his own name. Souchon’s first hit was “J’ai 10 ans” (1974), from the album of the same name. Souchon’s biggest hit was probably “Foule Sentimentale” from 1995’s [C’est Deja Ca](http://www.last.fm/music/Alain+Souchon/C%27est+Deja+Ca). His recent album is from 2005, called [La Vie Theodore](http://www.last.fm/music/Alain+Souchon/La+Vie+Theodore) which features his song “Et si en plus, y’a personne” [What if, even more, there is no one], a song condemning religious intolerance.      He wrote the theme for François Truffaut’s 1979 film Love on the Run (L’amour en fuite).
