Valance began her career as Felicity “Flick” Scully in the long- running Australian soap Neighbours in 1999. Valance left the series in 2002 to pursue a music career.      Valance’s first single as a recording artist was a cover of Turkish singer [Tarkan](http://www.last.fm/music/Tarkan)’s “[Kiss Kiss](http://www.last.fm/music/Holly+Valance/_/Kiss+Kiss)” (composed by Turkish “Diva” Sezen Aksu), released in 2002. The song debuted at No. 1 in both the Australian Recording Industry Association and UK Singles Charts charts in April/May 2002. The director’s cut version of the music video was notable in that Valance appeared to be dancing naked. She revealed that she was topless but also wearing flesh-coloured underwear. The footage was then digitally retouched adding strategically placed lighting effects. The song was nominated for four ARIA Music Awards.
