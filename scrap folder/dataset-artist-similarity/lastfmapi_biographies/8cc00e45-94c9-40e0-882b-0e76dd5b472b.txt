Cristian Castro (born Cristian Sáenz Castro, December 8, 1974, in Mexico City) is a Grammy Award-nominated Mexican pop singer. He is also known as “[Christian Castro](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Christian+Castro)”, “Cristian”, or “El Gallito Feliz” (The Happy Little Rooster).      Castro added the “h” to his first name for the release of his successful album, “[Mi Vida Sin Tu Amor](http://www.last.fm/music/Cristian+Castro/Mi+Vida+Sin+Tu+Amor)” in 1999. “Christian Castro,” however, is still not widely used as “Cristian Castro,” and Castro actually went back to using “Cristian” on his albums until 2004.      Castro released “[Azul](http://www.last.fm/music/Cristian+Castro/Azul)” in 2001, and won the “Best Latin Pop Album of the Year” award.      Castro married Paraguayan, Gabriela Bo, in Asunción in 2003.
