In 1995, at the age of 14, Lang released his first album, ‘_[Smokin](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonny+Lang/Smokin)_’. Performing both as himself and as as ‘Kid Jonny Lang & The Big Bang’, he achieved some budding success. As a result of the LP becoming a regional hit, a major-label bidding war ensued that culminated in Lang signing to A&M Records in 1996.      In 1997, at the age of 15, he released his major-label debut, ‘_[Lie To Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonny+Lang/Lie+To+Me)_’. Though it picked up mixed critical reviews, the album served as a commercial breakthrough, with single “[Lie To Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonny+Lang/_/Lie+To+Me)” particularly receiving much airplay and earning the #12 slot on Billboard’s Mainstream Rock chart. That [blues rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock) track continues to be beloved by Lang’s fan-base.      Lang followed with ‘_[Wander This World](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonny+Lang/Wander+This+World)_’, released on October 20, 1998. Broadening his sound somewhat with influences from classic [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) and modern [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock), the release experienced widespread success. His singles, “[Wander This World](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonny+Lang/_/Wander+This+World)” and “[Still Rainin’](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonny+Lang/_/Still+Rainin%27)”, did particularly well, the latter tune reaching the #8 slot on Billboard’s Mainstream Rock chart.      Several releases and constant touring later, Lang’s latest work is ‘_[Fight For My Soul](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonny+Lang/Fight+For+My+Soul)_’, released on September 2, 2013. The album has received critical acclaim from publications such has Allmusic, with the reviewers remarking that Lang “dives headfirst into classic soul and R&B, its elastic, funky grooves allowing the guitarist plenty of space to solo”. It also hit the #20 slot on Billboard’s ‘Top Rock Albums’ chart, selling extremely well.      Part of his success has been due to a voice that sounds somewhat like that of a 40-year-old blues veteran, containing what fans have seen as a harshness tempered by a fine falsetto that has taken prominence in his newest albums. Another part of his success is his scorching, electrifying guitar solos, which display a prodigious natural talent honed by years of practice and playing. Whatever the secret to his success, the youngster has quickly become a fixture in the blues world, drawing crowds wherever he goes
