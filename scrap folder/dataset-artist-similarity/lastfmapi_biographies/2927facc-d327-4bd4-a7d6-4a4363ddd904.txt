Maxime Le Forestier (born February 10, 1949 as Bruno Le Forestier) is a French singer. He was born in Paris to an English father and a French mother who had lived in England. He had two older sisters, Anne and Catherine. His musical training started on the violin. He attended the Lycée Condorcet, where he studied literature.      In 1965, Le Forestier formed a duo ([Cat et Maxime](http://www.last.fm/music/Cat+et+Maxime)) with his sister Catherine. Playing at cabaret venues on Paris’ Left Bank, the pair met and formed a friendship with [Georges Moustaki](http://www.last.fm/music/Georges+Moustaki). They were amongst the first artists to cover a number of songs by Moustaki - including [Ma liberté](http://www.last.fm/music/Georges+Moustaki/_/Ma+libert%C3%A9) and [Ma solitude](http://www.last.fm/music/Georges+Moustaki/_/Ma+solitude). In 1968, Catherine joined Moustaki as a backing singer. Le Forestier began to focus on songwriting and composed [Ballade pour un traître](http://www.last.fm/music/Ma xime+Le+Forestier/_/Ballade+pour+un+tra%C3%AEtre) which was recorded and released by the French/Italian singer and actor, [Serge Reggiani](http://www.last.fm/music/Serge+Reggiani).      Le Forestier continued as part-time singer/songwriter during his military service (beginning 1969) with a parachute regiment (the inspiration for the song Parachutiste). He recorded two songs: “[Cœur de Pierre, face de lune](htt p://www.last.fm/music/Maxime+Le+Forestier/_/C%C5%93ur+de+Pierre,+face+de+lune) ”, and [La Petite Fugue](http://www.last.fm/music/Maxime+Le+Forestier/_/La+Petite+Fugue).      His military service ending September 1970, Le Forestier refocused on his musical career. He developed a folksy style which was enormously popular in the 1970s and ’80s. His first album [Mon Frère](http://www.last.fm/music/Maxime+Le+Forestier/Mon+Fr%C3%A8re), released in 1973, contains several pieces that have entered French folklore, including the title song [Mon frère](http://www.last.fm/music/Maxime+Le+Forestier/_/Mon+fr%C3%A8re), [San Francisco](http://www.last.fm/music/Maxime+Le+Forestier/_/San+Francisco), [Comme un arbre](http://www.last.fm/music/Maxime+Le+Forestier/_/Comme+un+arbre) and [Education sentimentale](http://www.last.fm/music/Maxime+Le+Forestier/_/Educat ion+sentimentale). He toured extensively, both in France and abroad. In 1976, he toured in 14 cities in the USSR. Recently he has gained particular acclaim for his reworkings of the songs of Georges Brassens.
