Arthur Stewart “Art” Farmer (August 21, 1928 – October 4, 1999) was an American jazz trumpeter and flugelhorn player. He also played flumpet, a trumpet–flugelhorn combination specially designed for him.      He and his identical twin brother, double bassist [Addison Farmer](http://www.last.fm/music/Addison+Farmer), started playing professionally while in high school. Art gained greater attention after the release of a recording of his composition “Farmer’s Market” in 1952. He subsequently moved from Los Angeles to New York, where he performed and recorded with musicians such as [Horace Silver](http://www.last.fm/music/Horace+Silver), [Sonny Rollins](http://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+Rollins) and [Gigi Gryce](http://www.last.fm/music/Gigi+Gryce) and became known principally as a bebop player.   As Farmer’s reputation grew, he expanded from bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as [George Russell](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Russell) and [Teddy Charles](http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Charles). He went on to join [Gerry Mulligan](http://www.last.fm/music/Gerry+Mulligan)’s quartet and, with [Benny Golson](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Golson) to co-found [The Jazztet](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jazztet) Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist’s instrument in jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders. His playing is known for its individuality – most noticeably, its lyricism, warmth of tone and sensitivity.      Art Farmer was born an hour before his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, reportedly at 2201 Fourth Avenue. Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced when the boys were four, and their steelworker father was killed in a work accident not long after this. Art moved with his mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona when he was still four. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on cornet and then trumpet at the age of thirteen. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art’s grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church; this influenced Farmer’s first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer’s instrument for a year, until a cornet became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and no one at Farmer’s school could provide useful music lessons. He taught himself to read music and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet
