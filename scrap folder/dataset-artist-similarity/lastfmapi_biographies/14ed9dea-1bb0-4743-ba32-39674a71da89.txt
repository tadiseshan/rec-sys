**Marianne Faithfull** (born 29 December 1946 in London) is an English singer-songwriter and actress whose career spans more than four decades. Her early work in pop and rock music in the 1960s was overshadowed by her struggle with drug abuse in the 1970s. After a long commercial absence, she returned late in 1979 with the highly acclaimed album, [Broken English](http://www.last.fm/music/Marianne+Faithfull/Broken+English). Faithfull’s subsequent solo work, often critically-acclaimed, has at times been rather overshadowed by her personal history. From 1966 to 1970, she had a highly-publicised romantic relationship with Rolling Stones’ lead singer [Mick Jagger](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Jagger). She co-wrote “[Sister Morphine](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Sister+Morphine)”, which is featured on the Rolling Stones’ [Sticky Fingers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Sticky+Fingers) album.      Faithfull was born in Hampstead, London, to a military officer father, Major Glynn Faithfull, and the Baroness Eva Erisso, a Viennese noblewoman of half Jewish and half noble Austrian descent, coming from the Habsburg dynasty. Faithfull attended a Roman Catholic girls school.      Faithfull began her singing career in 1964 after being discovered at a launch party for [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones) by pop music producer Andrew Loog Oldham. Her first hit, “[As Tears Go By](http://www.last.fm/music/Marianne+Faithfull/_/As+Tears+Go+By)”, was written by [Mick Jagger](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Jagger) and [Keith Richards](http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Richards). She then released a series of successful singles, including “[This Little Bird](http://www.last.fm/music/Marianne+Faithfull/_/This+Little+Bird)”, “[Summer Nights](http://www.last.fm/music/Marianne+Faithfull/_/Summer+Nights)”, and “[Sister Morphine](http://www.last.fm/music/Marianne+Faithfull/_/Sister+Morphine)” (which she co-wrote with Jagger).      Faithfull married artist John Dunbar in 1965, and in that same year gave birth to a son named Nicholas. The marriage was short-lived however, and Faithfull began a much publicised relationship with Mick Jagger. The relationship with Jagger lasted throughout the late 1960s. After they split up in 1970, Faithfull briefly stopped recording and nursed a drug addiction. She moved to Dublin in the middle of the 1970s, and had quite a success with “[Dreaming My  Dreams](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Marianne+Faithfull/_/Dreaming+My+ Dreams)”, which reached the top of the Irish pop charts.      She returned to recording in 1979 with _[Broken English](http://www.last.fm/music/Marianne+Faithfull/Broken+English)_, one of her most critically hailed album releases. _Broken English_ also saw Faithfull emerge as a songwriter of some ability, with powerful songs on follow up albums _[Dangerous Acquaintances](http://www.last
