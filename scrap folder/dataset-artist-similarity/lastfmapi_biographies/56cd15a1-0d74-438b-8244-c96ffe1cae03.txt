Beginning with _My Name Is Barbra_, her albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her television specials.      Starting in 1969, Streisand tackled contemporary songwriters; like many talented singers of the day, she found herself a fish out of water in attempts to tackle rock, but her vocal talents prevailed and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented [Richard Perry](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Perry)-produced album _[Stoney End](http://www.last.fm/music/Barbra+Streisand/Stoney+End)_ in 1971. The title track, written by [Laura Nyro](http://www.last.fm/music/Laura+Nyro), was a big hit for Streisand.      Streisand’s 1980 album, _[Guilty](http://www.last.fm/music/Barbra+Streisand/Guilty)_ featured the songwriting, production and vocal talents of [Barry Gibb](http://www.last.fm/music/Barry+Gibb) and was the best-selling album of her recording career. During the 1970s, she was also highly prominent in the pop charts, with number-one records like [The Way We Were](http://www.last.fm/music/Barbra+Streisand/_/The+Way+We+Were), [Evergreen](http://www.last.fm/music/Barbra+Streisand/_/Evergreen), [No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)](http://www.last.fm/music/Barbra+Streisand/_/No+More+ Tears+\(Enough+Is+Enough\)) (her duet with [Donna Summer](http://www.last.fm/music/Donna+Summer)), and [Woman in Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Barbra+Streisand/_/Woman+in+Love); some of these came from soundtracks of her films. She recently took part in supporting Haiti in singing “We are the World 25th anniversary
