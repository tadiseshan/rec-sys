Tritt was born in Marietta, Georgia to James and Gwen Tritt. At age 3, he received his first guitar from his father. By 22, he had been through two divorces and had committed himself entirely to his music career. He has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1992. Today, he and wife Theresa have three children: Tyler Reese (born February 18, 1998), Tristan James (born June 16, 1999) and Terian Nathaniel (born November 20, 2003).      His breakthrough came with his first album, Country Club, from which three singles were released, as well as his first No. 1 hit with “Help Me Hold On”. His second album, It’s All About To Change, produced two top 3 hits including: “Anymore”, “The Whiskey Ain’t Workin’”, and “Here’s A Quarter (Call Someone Who Cares)”. The song “Bible Belt” was used in the movie, My Cousin Vinny, and, for which, he composed alternate lyrics exclusively for the use of the film.      Tritt has released a trilogy of music videos describing the tale of two paralyzed war veterans: Mac Singleton and his friend Al. In the video for “Tell Me I was Dreaming”, Tritt plays Singleton, a wheelchair bound veteran who tries to rescue his pregnant wife Annie from slipping off a boat, subsequently hitting her head on the side of the dock. She dies, but their baby, Annie, survives. The third video shows what happened with Singleton and his daughter after the second video.      Tritt’s latest album, My Honky Tonk History, showcases a wide range of styles, from love ballads to energetic footstompers.
