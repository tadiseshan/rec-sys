Buckshot LeFonque was a musical group project of Branford Marsalis. After playing with Sting, Miles Davis and other artists, he founded this band to create a new sound by merging classical jazz sound with rock, ballad/pop, Rhythm and Blues and hip-hop influences.      Two albums were released, [Buckshot LeFonque](http://www.last.fm/music/Buckshot+LeFonque/Buckshot+LeFonque) (1994) (which featured mostly DJ Premier produced tracks) and the follow up [Music Evolution](http://www.last.fm/music/Buckshot+LeFonque/Music+Evolution) (1997) (which featured mostly Frank McComb on the vocals). Other frequent collaborators were Branford Marsalis’ brother, Delfeayo Marsalis and rapper Uptown (of Dope On Plastic fame) aka 50 The Unknown Soldier. Both albums displayed a very broad musical picture, which is probably the reason why they failed to be commercially successful.      The name Buckshot LeFonque was a pseudonym of the jazz saxophonist Julian “Cannonball” Adderley.
