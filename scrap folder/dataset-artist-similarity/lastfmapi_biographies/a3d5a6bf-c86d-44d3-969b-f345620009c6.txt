Nick Lowe (born Nicholas Drain Lowe, 24 March 1949, Walton-on-Thames, England) is a well-respected British singer-songwriter, producer, and multi- instrumentalist. A pivotal figure in U.K. [pub rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/pub%20rock), [punk rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk%20rock), [power pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/power%20pop), and [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) throughout the [70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s) and later, Lowe was a key member of bands such as [Brinsley Schwarz](http://www.last.fm/music/Brinsley+Schwarz) and [Rockpile](http://www.last.fm/music/Rockpile) (with [Dave Edmunds](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Edmunds)). Perhaps best known for his songs “[(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love, And Understanding](http://www.las t.fm/music/Nick+Lowe/_/\(What%27s+So+Funny+%27Bout\)+Peace,+Love,+And+Understa nding)” and “[Cruel to Be Kind](http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Lowe/_/Cruel+to+Be+Kind)”, he has also famously done production work for [Elvis Costello](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello). Along with vocals, Lowe plays guitar, bass guitar, piano, and harmonica. In addition to his band membership, Lowe has recorded a string of well-reviewed solo albums.      Lowe began his recording career in 1966 as a member of [psychadelic rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/psychadelic%20rock) group [Kippington Lodge](http://www.last.fm/music/Kippington+Lodge), founded with his friend Brinsley Schwarz. That band released a few singles on Parlophone. Three years later, Kippington Lodge had changed its name to [Brinsley Schwarz](http://www.last.fm/music/Brinsley+Schwarz) and its musical focus to [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) and [blues rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock).      After leaving Brinsley Schwarz in the mid-1970s, Lowe began playing in [Rockpile](http://www.last.fm/music/Rockpile) with [Dave Edmunds](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Edmunds). In August 1976 Lowe released “So It Goes” b/w “Heart of the City”, the first single on the Stiff Records label where he was in-house producer (the label’s first EP was Lowe’s 1977 four-track release _Bowi_, apparently named in response to David Bowie’s contemporary LP _Low_) . On this and other labels, Lowe would go on to produce The Damned’s _Damned Damned Damned_ and many albums by Elvis Costello. Upon moving from Stiff to Jake Riviera’s Radar and F-Beat labels, Lowe became extremely selective in his choice of production tasks.      Because the two main writers in Rockpile had contracts with different record labels and managers, albums were always credited to either Lowe or Edmunds, so there is only one official Rockpile album, from the very end of the collaboration - 1980’s _Seconds of Pleasure_, featuring the Lowe songs “When I Write the Book” and “Teacher Teacher” - but all of Lowe’s and Edmunds’ solo albums from the period were effectively Rockpile albums. Rockpile’s demise was hastened by a number of conflicts, not between the group, but their management
