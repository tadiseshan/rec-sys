Art Tatum (**Arthur Tatum, Jr.**, October 13, 1909, Toledo, Ohio, USA - November 5, 1956, Los Angeles, California) was an American [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) pianist and virtuoso who played with phenomenal facility despite being nearly blind since birth.      Tatum is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time. He was noted for the complexity and speed of his performances, which set a new standard for jazz piano virtuosity.   Tatum drew inspiration from his contemporaries [James P. Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/James+P.+Johnson) and [Fats Waller](http://www.last.fm/music/Fats+Waller), and had a great influence on other famous jazz pianists, such as [Thelonious Monk](http://www.last.fm/music/Thelonious+Monk), [Bud Powell](http://www.last.fm/music/Bud+Powell), [Chick Corea](http://www.last.fm/music/Chick+Corea), and [Oscar Peterson](http://www.last.fm/music/Oscar+Peterson). Saxophonist [Charlie Parker](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker) took his first job in New York as a dishwasher where Tatum played, just for the experience of hearing Tatum’s harmonic inventions.      Tatum identified Fats Waller as his main influence, but according to pianist [Teddy Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Wilson) and saxophonist Eddie Barefield, “Art Tatum’s favorite jazz piano player was [Earl Hines](http://www.last.fm/music/Earl+Hines). He used to buy all of Earl’s records and would improvise on them. He’d play the record but he’d improvise over what Earl was doing … ‘course, when you heard Art play you didn’t hear nothing of anybody but Art. But he got his ideas from Earl’s style of playing – but Earl never knew that.”   A major event in his meteoric rise to success was his appearance at a cutting contest in 1933 at Morgan’s bar in New York City that included Waller, Johnson and Willie “The Lion” Smith. Standard contest pieces included Johnson’s “Harlem Strut” and “Carolina Shout” and Fats Waller’s “Handful of Keys.” Tatum triumphed with his arrangements of “Tea for Two” and “Tiger Rag”, in a performance that was considered to be the last word in stride piano. James P. Johnson, reminiscing about Tatum’s debut afterward, simply said, “When Tatum played Tea For Two that night I guess that was the first time I ever heard it really played.” Tatum’s debut was historic because he outplayed the elite competition and heralded the demise of the stride era. He was not challenged further until stride specialist Donald Lambert initiated a half-serious rivalry with him.      Tatum worked first around Toledo and Cleveland and then later in New York at the Onyx Club for a few months; he recorded his first four solo sides on the Brunswick label in March, 1933. He returned to Ohio and played around the American midwest - Toledo, Cleveland, Detroit, Saint Louis and Chicago - in the mid-1930s and played on the Fleischman Hour radio program hosted by Rudy Vallee in 1935
