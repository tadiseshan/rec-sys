Jimmy Buffett (born December 25, 1946 in Pascagoula, Mississippi, United States) is a singer/songwriter, best known for his “island escapism” lifestyle and music including hits such as “Margaritaville” and “Come Monday”. He has a rabid, but genial, cult following known as “Parrotheads.” They call the youngest members “Parakeets.”      Buffett has written three No. 1 best sellers. Tales from Margaritaville and Where Is Joe Merchant? both spent over seven months on the New York Times Best Seller fiction list. His book A Pirate Looks At Fifty went straight to No. 1 on the New York Times Bestseller non-fiction list, making him one of seven authors in that list’s history to have reached No. 1 on both the fiction and non-fiction lists. The other six authors who have accomplished this are Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, William Styron, Irving Wallace, Dr. Seuss and Mitch Albom. He also co-wrote two children’s books, Jolly Mon and Trouble Dolls, with his eldest daughter, Savannah Jane Buffett.      “A Salty Piece of Land”, was released on November 30, 2004, and included a CD single of the same title. The book was a New York Times best seller soon after its release.      His latest book, “Swine Not,” hit bookshelves on May 13th. It’s a colorful tale about a family that lives in a posh New York hotel while covertly smuggling in their pet pig named Rumpy.      On Jan 25, 2011, he did an unintentional stage dive whilst touring Australia. Thankfully, the good Mr. Buffett is a resilient bloke and was released from hospital the following day and doing fine.
