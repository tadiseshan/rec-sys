**Gene Pitney** (born Gene Francis Alan Pitney in Hartford, Connecticut, USA on 17 February 1940 - died 5 April 2006 (Cardiff, Wales). After a successful singing career spanning five decades, at the age of 66, he was found dead of natural causes, while in the middle of a sellout UK tour.      Pitney, a pop rock pioneer, had his greatest success overall in Britain, first travelling there after his first self penned hit in 1961. “I Wanna Love My Life Away” hit #26 on the UK singles chart & just broke into the top 40 in the US.      His early music recorded for the “musicor” label was romantic, lonely and dramatic, fitting in alongside contemporaries like [Buddy Holly](http://www.last.fm/music/Buddy+Holly), [Neil Sedaka](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Sedaka), [Roy Orbison](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Orbison) & serves as an audio time capsule of a more innocent time.

All in all Pitney himself recorded 16 top 40 songs in the US from 1961 to 1968.      Gene’s biggest popularity was in England, where he used [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones) publicist Andrew Loog Oldham to get his fame established, which lasted there to the day of his death. In the UK, Gene had 40 top-40 charting hits through 1974.
