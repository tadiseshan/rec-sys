Lucio Battisti (5 March 1943 â€“ 9 September 1998) was an Italian singer and composer. He is considered to be one of the best-known and most influential musicians and authors in Italian pop/rock music history.      Battisti started his career in 1966 and from 1969 to 1994 he released 18 albums in his home country. A significant part of his production was translated into Spanish (various albums) and English (one album). He was renowned to be an extremely reserved artist: during his successful career he performed only a small number of live concerts, and in the early 1980s he announced he would limit himself to his studio albums, completely disappearing from the Italian public scene.      Battisti died after long illness on September 9, 1998.
