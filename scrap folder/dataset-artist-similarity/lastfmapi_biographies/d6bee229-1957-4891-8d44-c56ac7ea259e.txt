Al Kooper (born Alan Peter Kuperschmidt February 5, 1944, Brooklyn, New York) is an American songwriter, producer and musician, probably best known for organizing the group [Blood, Sweat & Tears](http://www.last.fm/music/Blood,+Sweat+&+Tears), though he didn’t stay with the group long enough to share its popularity.      His first musical success was as a 14-year-old guitarist in the [Royal Teens](http://www.last.fm/music/Royal+Teens), best known for their novelty blues riff, “[Short Shorts](http://www.last.fm/music/Royal+Teens/_/Short+Shorts)”. In 1960, he joined the song-writing team of Bob Brass and Irwin Levine, who wrote the hit, “[This Diamond Ring](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Lewis+and+The+Playboys/_/Th is+Diamond+Ring)”, for [Gary Lewis and The Playboys](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Lewis+and+The+Playboys). When he was 21, he moved to Greenwich Village.      He performed with [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan) in concert in 1965 and in the studio in 1965 and 1966, including playing Hammond organ with Dylan at the (in)famous Newport Folk Festival of 1965. He worked extensively with [Mike Bloomfield](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Bloomfield) for a number of years after the two met as studio musicians on Dylan’s legendary [Highway 61 Revisited](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Highway+61+Revisited) album.      In 1965, he co-formed [The Blues Project](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Blues+Project) and played their most famous gig at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. He formed Blood, Sweat & Tears in the same year, leaving after the group’s first album, [Child Is Father to the Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Blood,+Sweat+&+Tears/Child+Is+Fath er+to+the+Man), in 1968.      Kooper played on hundreds of records, including [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones), [B.B. King](http://www.last.fm/music/B.B.+King), [The Who](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who) and [Cream](http://www.last.fm/music/Cream). On occasion, he has even overdubbed on his own efforts, as on [The Live Adventures Of Mike Bloomfield And Al Koope r](http://www.last.fm/music/Al+Kooper;Mike+Bloomfield/The+Live+Adventures+Of+M ike+Bloomfield+And+Al+Kooper) album, as Roosevelt Gook. He discovered the band [Lynyrd Skynyrd](http://www.last.fm/music/Lynyrd+Skynyrd), and produced their first three albums, including the single [Sweet Home Alabama](http://www.last.fm/music/Lynyrd+Skynyrd/_/Sweet+Home+Alabama).
