Her latest record, [July](http://www.last.fm/music/Marissa+Nadler/July), is out now on Sacred Bones Records at <http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/releases/sbr103/> and Bella Union in the EU. [July](http://www.last.fm/music/Marissa+Nadler/July) is also available on Amazon at the following location <http://www.amazon.com /July-Marissa-Nadler/dp/B00GK6Y8QU> and on iTunes at <https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/july/id739937685> Her previous record was self-released on June 14th, 2011 and itâ€™s companion record, [The Sister](http://www.last.fm/music/Marissa+Nadler/The+Sister), was released in April of 2012.      Nadler writes strange, yet [classic](http://www.last.fm/tag/classic), [melancholy](http://www.last.fm/tag/melancholy) songs. Her voice is often bathed in a wash of reverb and space echo and creates a ghostly, atmospheric feeling to the music.      She has [american gothic](http://www.last.fm/tag/american%20gothic) leanings; her songs often take place in an imagined, idealistic time with a cast of characters of her own creation. Her links to American Gothic are reinforced by [Annabelle Lee](http://www.last.fm/music/Marissa+Nadler/_/Annabelle+Lee), the last song on her debut album, [Ballads of Living and Dying](http://www.last.fm/music/Marissa+Nadler/Ballads+of+Living+and+Dying), which puts the poem of the same title by [Edgar Allan Poe](http://www.last.fm/music/Edgar+Allan+Poe) to a musical backing. Singing in a haunting mezzo-soprano, the foundation of her songs are her delicate 6-string acoustic guitar, often accompanied by variety of instruments, including electric guitar, theremin, and piano. Marissa Nadler is continuously thought of as a prolific and thoughtful musician, and it seems that a neverending flow of beautiful songs pours from her fingers and voice.
