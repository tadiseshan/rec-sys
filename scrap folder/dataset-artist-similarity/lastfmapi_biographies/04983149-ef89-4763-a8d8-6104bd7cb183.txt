**Cocosuma** is a [downtempo](http://www.last.fm/tag/downtempo) band from Paris. Their albums, published at Third Side Records have met both critical and public acclaim. Some of their tracks are picked for [lounge](http://www.last.fm/tag/lounge) or [trip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/trip-hop) compilations. Cocosuma gained some fame in 2005 with the French mini-series Clara Sheller for which their song _The Servant_ was the end credits.      Finally, they’ve changed their mind.   After a debut album boldly entitled ‘I refuse to grow up’ which got them very impressive reviews, a growing hype both in France and abroad, numerous compilations, success in Japan (Ryuichi Sakamoto recently picked one of our songs on his playlist) and a track on a shitty Hollywood blockbuster [‘The In- laws’ starring the great Michael Douglas], Cocosuma, a Paris-based trio, were now ready to be full-grown artists. The do-it-yourself low-fi pop of the beginning had evolved into something larger and deeper. For real.      Their previous singer having decided to concentrate on more important and boring stuff, Chimo and Chab were left with the seemingly impossible task to find a singer as charming and sweet, task in which they succeeded when they heard the voice of Amanda on a monday morning.   ‘Pointing excitedly at the sky’, their second album is out in april and it’s filled with: rainbows, sunshine, weird lyrics on numerous topics (life after death, consumer society, lions, witches, you name it…), subtle beauties, melancholy and hidden treasures.      Taken from their official site: <http://www.cocosuma.net/>         Cocosuma just released a new EP, entitled “Charlotte’s on Fire”. It features 4 new songs, as well as remixes from Bo’Tox, Nouvelle Vague and Origami Biro.
