**Norman Greenbaum** (born 20th November 1942, Malden, Massachusetts) is a U.S. [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter).      He is best known for writing and performing his hit song “[Spirit in the Sky](http://www.last.fm/music/Norman+Greenbaum/_/Spirit+in+the+Sky)”, which sold two million copies in 1969 and 1970. Though Greenbaum is generally regarded as a one-hit wonder; several of his records placed prominently in the charts. In 1968, under the name [Dr. West’s Medicine Show and Junk Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+West%27s+Medicine+Show+and+Junk+Band), he recorded the novelty hit “The Eggplant That Ate Chicago”.      Greenbaum’s initial interest in music was sparked by southern blues music and the folk music that was popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He performed with various bands in high school and studied music at Boston University for two years. In college he performed at local coffeehouses but eventually dropped out and moved to Los Angeles in 1965.
