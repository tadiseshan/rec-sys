[Remy Zero](http://www.last.fm/music/Remy+Zero) is an Birmingham, Alabama based alternative rock band made up of [Cinjun Tate](http://www.last.fm/music/Cinjun+Tate) (vocals, guitar), Shelby Tate (vocals, guitar, keyboards), [Gregory Slay](http://www.last.fm/music/Gregory+Slay) (drums,perc,keyboards), [Cedric LeMoyne](http://www.last.fm/music/Cedric+LeMoyne) (bass, guitars), and [Jeffrey Cain](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeffrey+Cain) (guitar, pianos, sounds).      Before recording any full length albums, [Radiohead](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead) found their demo tape and invited them to be part of the US tour for [The Bends](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+Bends). After that, they moved from Birmingham, Alabama to Los Angeles, California to record their first album. Several band mates suffered from substance abuse and homelessness after moving from Alabama.      Their first album, self-titled, drew from these experiences and unfortunately received little recognition or sales. The subsequent album Villa Elaine caused them to be praised as “the next big thing”. Villa Elaine was recorded when the band was living in an apartment of the same name in Hollywood. Remy Zero’s third album The Golden Hum was also received well. A 30 second clip of the song “[Save Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Remy+Zero/_/Save+Me)” from The Golden Hum was used as the theme song for WB’s Smallville. Remy Zero’s music has also been on KCRW’s Morning Becomes Eclectic radio show. Most recently Remy Zero’s song “[Fair](http://www.last.fm/music/Remy+Zero/_/Fair)” from Villa Elaine was used in the film Garden State, and “[Prophecy](http://www.last.fm/music/Remy+Zero/_/Prophecy)”, also from Villa Ellaine was used in The Last Kiss. In 2003 [Jeffrey Cain](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeffrey+Cain), [Cedric LeMoyne](http://www.last.fm/music/Cedric+LeMoyne), and [Gregory Slay](http://www.last.fm/music/Gregory+Slay) formed [The Engine Room](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Engine+Room) and wrote the theme song to the television show Nip/Tuck titled “[A Perfect Lie](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Engine+Room/_/A+Perfect+Lie)” which was nominated for an Emmy Award.      Remy Zero broke up after making The Golden Hum and many of its members have joined new bands.
