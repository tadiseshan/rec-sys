Will Oldham (born 24 December 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. His music is often (perhaps inappropriately) placed under the genre of “[alternative country](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20country)”. Oldham was born in [Louisville, Kentucky](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States/Louisville). He briefly attended Brown University.      Oldham has recorded under many names other than his own, including [Palace](http://www.last.fm/music/Palace), [Palace Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/Palace+Brothers), [Palace Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Palace+Music), [Palace Songs](http://www.last.fm/music/Palace+Songs), and [Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy](http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+%27Prince%27+Billy). He often plays and records with other musicians, including [David Pajo](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Pajo) and his brothers Ned and Paul Oldham, but is generally the chief creator of the music. He has also been involved in musical projects and bands such as [Box Of Chocolates](http://www.last.fm/music/Box+Of+Chocolates), [Amalgamated Sons of Rest](http://www.last.fm/music/Amalgamated+Sons+of+Rest), [The Anomoanon](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Anomoanon), [The Boxhead Ensemble](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Boxhead+Ensemble), [Superwolf](http://www.last.fm/music/Superwolf) (with Matt Sweeney), [Continental Op](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Continental+Op) (with David Pajo), [Current 93](http://www.last.fm/music/Current+93) (with David Tibet), and [The Silver Jews](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Silver+Jews) (with David Berman).      Oldham has said that the Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy moniker has many references. These include Bonnie Prince Charlie, an 18th century Jacobite; Billy the Kid, the 19th century American outlaw also known as William Bonney; and the American singer [Nat King Cole](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole).
