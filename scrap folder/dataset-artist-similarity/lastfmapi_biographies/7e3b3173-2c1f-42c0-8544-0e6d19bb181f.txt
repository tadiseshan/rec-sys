**Wendy Carlos** (born 14 November 1939 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island) is a [composer](http://www.last.fm/tag/composer) and [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) musician. Carlos trained as a composer and worked as a recording engineer before her 1968 _[Switched-On Bach](http://www.last.fm/music/Wendy+Carlos/Switched-On+Bach)_ became the first classical music album to be certified platinum. This, and subsequent albums, brought the Moog synthesizer to wider public attention, and her 1971 soundtrack to _[A Clockwork Orange](http://www.last.fm/music/Wendy+Carlos/A+Clockwork+Orange)_ introduced the vocoder. Other notable work includes soundtracks for _[The Shining](http://www.last.fm/music/Wendy+Carlos/The+Shining)_ and _[Tron](http://www.last.fm/music/Wendy+Carlos/Tron)_. (Her first six recordings were released under the name Walter Carlos.)
