**Barry White** (born Barrence Eugene Carter in Galveston, Texas, USA; September 12, 1944 - July 4, 2003) was an American record producer, songwriter and singer.      White grew up in his hometown in Galveston, Texas, singing gospel songs with his mother and taught himself to play the piano. Shortly after moving from Texas to South Central Los Angeles, White made his recording debut at the tender age of 11, playing piano on Jesse Belvin’s “Goodnight My Love”. He made his first record when he was 16 with a group called the Upfronts. The song was called “Little Girl” on a local L.A. label called Lummtone Records. He later worked for various independent labels around Los Angeles, landing an A&R position with Bob Keane, the man responsible for the first pop recordings by Sam Cooke. One of his labels, Mustang, was hot at the time with a group called the Bobby Fuller Four in 1966. White was hired for forty dollars a week to do A&R for Keane’s family of labels: Del-Fi, Mustang and Bronco. During this time, White flirted with the idea of being a recording artist, making a record for Bronco called _All in the Run of a Day_. But he chose to stick with his A&R duties. One of the first groups he worked with was the Versatiles who later changed their name to [The 5th Dimension](http://www.last.fm/music/The+5th+Dimension). White’s first big hit came from an artist familiar to dancefloor denizens - Viola Wills, whose “Lost Without the Love of My Guy” went Top 20 R&B. His salary went up to sixty dollars a week. White started working with the Bobby Fuller Four. Bob Keene and Larry Nunes - who later became White’s spiritual advisor and true friend - wanted to cut a female act. White had heard about a singer named [Felice Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Felice+Taylor). They had three hit records, “It May Be Winter Outside”, “I’m Under the Influence of Love”, and “I Feel Love Coming On”. They were huge hits in England. White started making 400 dollars a week.      When Bronco went out of business, White began doing independent production. Those were some lean times for White. Veteran arranger Gene Page (who would later arrange or co-arrange White’s hits) helped him out, giving him work and non-repayable loans. Then three years later, Paul Politti, who also worked at Bronco, contacted him to tell him that Nunes was interested in starting a business with him. Nunes had started cutting tracks for a concept album he was working on. Meanwhile, White had started working with a girl group which hadn’t done any singing professionally. They rehearsed for almost a year. White wrote [Walkin’ In The Rain With The One I Love](http://www.last.fm/music /Love+Unlimited/_/Walkin%27+In+The+Rain+With+The+One+I+Love) with lyrics that were inspired by conversations with one of the singers, Glodean James (who would later become White’s second wife). White christened the group [Love Unlimited](http://www.last.fm/music/Love+Unlimited)
