**James Brown** (b. **[James Joseph Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Joseph+Brown)**, 3 May 1933, in Barnwell, SC, USA – d. 25 Dec 2006), is recognized as one of the most influential figures in 20th century music. He was a seminal force in the evolution of [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel) and [rhythm and blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/rhythm%20and%20blues) into [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) and [funk](http://www.last.fm/tag/funk). He has also left his mark on numerous other musical genres, including [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock), [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz), [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae), [disco](http://www.last.fm/tag/disco), [dance](http://www.last.fm/tag/dance) and [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) music, and [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) music.      Joining **[Bobby Byrd](http://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Byrd)**’s vocal group [The Famous Flames](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Famous+Flames), in 1955, **Brown**’s early mid-50s recordings were fairly straightforward gospel- inspired R&B compositions, heavily influenced by contemporaries, including: **[Ray Charles](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles)** and **[Little Richard](http://www.last.fm/music/Little+Richard)**, who was particularly significant in **Brown**’s development as a musician and showman.      **Brown** followed his successful **_[Live At the Apollo](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown/Live+At+the+Apollo)_** (1963), with a string of singles that - along with the work of **[Allen Toussaint](http://www.last.fm/music/Allen+Toussaint)**, in [New Orleans](/tag/New+Orleans) \- essentially defined the foundation of [funk](http://www.last.fm/tag/funk) music. During the mid-1960s, two of **Brown**’s signature tunes **[Papa’s Got A Brand New Bag](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown/_/Papa%27s+Got+A+Brand+New+Bag)** and **[I Got You (I Feel Good)](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown/_/I+Got+You+\(I+Feel+Good\))** (both from 1965), were his first Top 10 pop hits, as well as major #1 R&B hits - each remaining the top-selling singles, in black venues, for over a month. As the 1960s neared their end, **Brown** continued to refine the new funk idiom. His 1967 #1 R&B hit, **[Cold Sweat](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown/_/Cold+Sweat)** \- sometimes cited as the first true funk song - was the first of his recordings to contain a [drum break](http://www.last.fm/tag/drum%20break) and harmony reduced to a single chord change.      His recordings influenced many contemporaries / followers, most immediately: [Sly & The Family Stone](http://www.last.fm/music/Sly+&+The+Family+Stone), [Charles Wright & The Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band](http://www.last.fm/music /Charles+Wright+&+The+Watts+103rd+Street+Rhythm+Band), [Booker T. & The M.G.’s](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Booker+T.+&+The+M.G.%27s), [Edwin Starr](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+Starr), [The Temptations](http://www.last
