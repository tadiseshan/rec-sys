Ernest Ranglin (born June 19, 1932) is a famous [Jamaica](http://www.last.fm/place/Jamaica)n guitarist.      As a child, Ranglin played [ukulele](http://www.last.fm/tag/ukulele), then guitar in his teen years. [Charlie Christian](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Christian) was an early influence. Ranglin played on many classic recordings, with [Jimmy Cliff](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Cliff), [Monty Alexander](http://www.last.fm/music/Monty+Alexander), [Prince Buster](http://www.last.fm/music/Prince+Buster), [The Skatalites](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Skatalites), and others. Ranglin toured extensively with the Eric Deans Orchestra, one of the top bands in the [caribbean](http://www.last.fm/tag/caribbean).      In 1958, Chris Blackwell recorded a Ranglin single; it was the first Island Records release. Later recordings in the late 1950s and early 1960s are often regarded as important in the early development of [ska](http://www.last.fm/tag/ska). In 1964, Ranglin, with [Coxsone Dodd](http://www.last.fm/music/Coxsone+Dodd) and singer [Millie](http://www.last.fm/music/Millie) recorded “[My Boy Lollipop](http://www.last.fm/music/Millie/_/My+Boy+Lollipop)”, the first Jamaican song to achieve international success.      Some credit Ranglin with the invention of the [core style](http://www.last.fm/tag/core%20style) of guitar play (sometimes known as scratching) found in nearly all Ska music.      Ranglin has continued recording, often blending [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) with [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae). In 1997, Ranglin was reunited with the [Skatalites](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Skatalites), for the album [Ball Of Fire](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Skatalites/Ball+Of+Fire).
