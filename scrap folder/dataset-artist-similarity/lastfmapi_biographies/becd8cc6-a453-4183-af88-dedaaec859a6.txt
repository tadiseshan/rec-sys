**Gloria Estefan** (born Gloria María Fajardo, September 1, 1957, in Havana, Cuba) is a seven-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter, actress and social activist. Known as the “Queen of Latin Pop”, she in the top 100 best-selling music artists with over 100 million albums sold worldwide, 31.5 million of those in the United States. Estefan is the most successful crossover performer in Latin music to date.      Beginning her career in 1975 as lead vocalist for the then exclusively Spanish-language band, [Miami Sound Machine](http://www.last.fm/music/Miami+Sound+Machine), before crossing over to mainstream pop success with the international hit singles “Dr. Beat” (1984) and “Conga” (1986), Estefan emerged as one of the biggest new stars in the mid-’80s, predating the still nascent Latin pop explosion by a decade, and scoring a series of propulsive dance hits rooted in the rhythms of her native Cuba, before shifting her focus to softer, more ballad-oriented fare.      Born in Havana, Cuba, the young Gloria Fajardo was raised primarily in Miami, FL, after her father, a bodyguard of Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, was forced to flee the island following the 1959 coup helmed by Fidel Castro. In the fall of 1975, Fajardo and her cousin Merci Murciano auditioned for the Miami Latin Boys, a local wedding band headed by keyboardist [Emilio Estefan](http://www.last.fm/music/Emilio+Estefan). With their addition, the group was rechristened Miami Sound Machine and four years later, Fajardo and Estefan were wed. As Miami Sound Machine began composing their own original material, their fusion of pop, disco, and salsa earned a devoted local following, and in 1979 the group issued their first Spanish-language LP on CBS International. Despite a growing Hispanic fan base, they did not cross over to non-Latin audiences until “Dr. Beat” topped European dance charts in 1984.      With 1985’s _[Primitive Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Miami+Sound+Machine/Primitive+Love)_, Miami Sound Machine recorded their first English-language effort, scoring three Top Ten pop hits in the U.S. alone with the infectious “Conga”, “Bad Boy”, and “Words Get in the Way”. Following 1987’s triple-platinum _[Let It Loose](http://www.last.fm/music/Miami+Sound+Machine/Let+It+Loose)_, Estefan took top billing and the group changed its name to Gloria Estefan & The Miami Sound Machine in 1988, reeling off four Top Ten hits - “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You”, “Can’t Stay Away from You”, the chart-topping “Anything for You”, and “1-2-3”. 1989’s _[Cuts Both Ways](http://www.last.fm/music/Gloria+Estefan/Cuts+Both+Ways)_ was credited to Estefan alone and generated her second #1 hit, “Don’t Wanna Lose You”. However, on March 20, 1990, while touring in support of the album, her bus was struck by a tractor trailer. Estefan suffered a broken vertebra that required extensive surgery and kept her off the road for over a year
