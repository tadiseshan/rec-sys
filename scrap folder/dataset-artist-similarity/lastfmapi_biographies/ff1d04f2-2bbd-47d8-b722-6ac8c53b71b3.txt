Donell Jones (born May 22, 1973) is an American R&B singer, songwriter and producer, most notable for the hits “[U Know What’s Up](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/_/U+Know+What%27s+Up)”, “[Where I Wanna Be](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/_/Where+I+Wanna+Be)” and his cover of [Stevie Wonder](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder)’s “[Knocks Me Off My Feet](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/_/Knocks+Me+Off+My+Feet)”.      Born in Chicago, Illinois, Jones’ upbringing was rough. He struggled between wanting to be a musician and to be a member of a street gang. After a brush with death, Jones left the gang and focused on a music career forming the group [Porscha](http://www.last.fm/music/Porscha). However, Jones was gaining notice as a writer penning songs for established R&B acts such as [Usher](http://www.last.fm/music/Usher), producing the singer’s 1995 hit, “[Think Of You](http://www.last.fm/music/Usher/_/Think+Of+You)”, [702](http://www.last.fm/music/702)’s “[Get It Together](http://www.last.fm/music/702/_/Get+It+Together)” and also wrote for groups such as [Brownstone](http://www.last.fm/music/Brownstone) and [Silk](http://www.last.fm/music/Silk).      In 1996, he signed with LaFace Records and released his debut album, [My Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/My+Heart), which included his hit cover of [Stevie Wonder](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder)’s 1976 ballad “[Knocks Me Off My Feet](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/_/Knocks+Me+Off+My+Feet)”. It wasn’t until 1999 however that Jones began to establish himself as a R&B hit maker with the album, [Where I Wanna Be](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/Where+I+Wanna+Be). The album yielded the number-one hits such as “[U Know What’s Up](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/_/U+Know+What%27s+Up)”, which featured [TLC](http://www.last.fm/music/TLC) member Lisa “Left-Eye” Lopes and the title track. Other hits included “[Shorty (Got Her Eyes On Me)](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/_/Shorty+\(Got+Her+Eyes+On+Me\))” and “[This Luv](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/_/This+Luv)”.      In 2002, Jones released the gold-selling [Life Goes On](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/Life+Goes+On) album, which featured the hits, “[You Know That I Love You](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/_/You+Know+That+I+Love+You)” and “[Put Me Down](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/_/Put+Me+Down)” featuring [Styles P.](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Styles+P.). Four years later, he released his fourth album, [Journey Of A Gemini](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/Journey+Of+A+Gemini), which featured the Tim & Bob hit, “[I’m Gonna Be](http://www.last.fm/music/Donell+Jones/_/I%27m+Gonna+Be)”, which became a big hit on Urban AC.
