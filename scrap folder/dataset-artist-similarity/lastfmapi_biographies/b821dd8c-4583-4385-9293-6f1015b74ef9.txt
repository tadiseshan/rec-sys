**T-Bone Burnett** (born Joseph Henry Burnett) is perhaps best known as a producer of other artists, such as [Robert Plant & Alison Krauss](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Plant+&+Alison+Krauss), [Counting Crows](http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows), [The Wallflowers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Wallflowers), [Los Lobos](http://www.last.fm/music/Los+Lobos), [Gillian Welch](http://www.last.fm/music/Gillian+Welch), [Kris Kristofferson](http://www.last.fm/music/Kris+Kristofferson), [Cassandra Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Cassandra+Wilson), [Elvis Costello](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello), [Autolux](http://www.last.fm/music/Autolux), and his ex-wife [Sam Phillips](http://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Phillips). He is known for very natural-sounding productions. In his solo work, he is a respected, if quirky, singer/songwriter. He has also worked on the soundtracks of several films by the Coen Brothers (including the very successful _[O Brother, Where Art Thou?](http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/O+Brother,+Where+Art+Thou%3F)_ soundtrack, which won him a Grammy Award), as well as _[Cold Mountain](http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Cold+Mountain)_ and _[Walk the Line](http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Walk+the+Line)_.      In the 70s, he was a member of the [Alpha Band](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Alpha+Band) and toured as part of [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan)’s Rolling Thunder Review.      His first album of new solo material since 1992, [The True False Identity](http://www.last.fm/music/T-Bone+Burnett/The+True+False+Identity), and the career retrospective [Twenty Twenty: The Esssential T-Bone Burnett](ht tp://www.last.fm/music/T-Bone+Burnett/Twenty+Twenty:+The+Esssential+T-Bone+Bur nett) were both released in May 2006.      In 1997, Burnett created new songs for the [Sam Shepard](http://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Shepard) play _The Tooth of Crime: Second Dance_, which premiered in New York City the same year in an off- Broadway production that featured Vincent D’Onofrio and Kirk Acevedo. A CD of these songs ([Tooth of Crime](http://www.last.fm/music/T-Bone+Burnett/Tooth+of+Crime)) was released in May, 2008.
