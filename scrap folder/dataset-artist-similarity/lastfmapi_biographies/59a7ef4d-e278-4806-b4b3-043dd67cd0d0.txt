**Da Lench Mob** were a [rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/rap) group who first appeared on [Ice Cube](http://www.last.fm/music/Ice+Cube)’s debut album _”AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted”_. Da Lench Mob (Shorty, J-Dee, and T-Bone) struck out on their own, with Ice Cube as their executive producer, in 1992.       Da Lench Mob’s debut album, _”Guerillas In Tha Mist”_, was a fiery burst of [political rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/political%20rap) and trademark [west coast](http://www.last.fm/tag/west%20coast) rhythms. The video for the album’s lead single, also titled _”Guerillas In Tha Mist”_, became quite popular in the fall of 1992. The album alluded to the social atmosphere and racial tension that was ignited during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.      J-Dee was sentenced to life in prison for attempted murder in 1993, and was dropped by the record label. Instead of disbanding, an Oakland based rapper called Maulkie was bought in to replace J-Dee for the groups sophomore effort, _”Planet of da Apes”_, released in 1994. The group broke up very soon afterwards.      Their song _”Guerillas In Tha Mist”_ was featured on the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack, on the station Radio Los Santos.      The group hasn’t actually broken up, it is said that they plan on working on a new album. J-Dee is also probably to be released in a few years.
