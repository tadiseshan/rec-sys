California Guitar Trio (CGT) is a band of three guitar players founded in 1991. Paul Richards of Salt Lake City, Utah, Bert Lams of Brussels, Belgium, and Hideyo Moriya of Tokyo, Japan first met in England at one of Robert Fripp’s Guitar Craft Courses in 1987. After completing several of these intensive courses, the three toured worldwide with Fripp’s League of Crafty Guitarists. Wanting to continue together after the League had run its course, Bert, Paul and Hideyo convened in Los Angeles and founded The California Guitar Trio in 1991, honing their intricate original compositions, surf covers, and classical re-workings.      In 1992 and 1993 the trio performed widely with Robert Fripp and Trey Gunn as part of the Robert Fripp String Quintet. The group gained wider exposure and wowed a receptive audience performing in support of King Crimson’s Thrak 1995 Summer Tour across North America and Europe.      With a whirlwind of instrumental styles fusing classical, rock, blues, jazz, world music, bluegrass, as well as the quintessential California musical genre surf music, the California Guitar Trio’s stunning virtuosity and sly sense of humor have earned them a rabid following and wide notoriety, with significant crossover in the progressive, acoustic and classical music scenes.      Over the past 12 years of nearly incessant touring, the California Guitar Trio has shared the stage with superb musicians and performers such as: The Andreas Kapsalis & Goran Ivanovic Guitar Duo, King Crimson, John McLaughlin, David Sylvian, Tito Puente, Leftover Salmon, Taj Mahal, Steve Lukather, Simon Phillips, Adrian Legg, Enchant, and many more.
