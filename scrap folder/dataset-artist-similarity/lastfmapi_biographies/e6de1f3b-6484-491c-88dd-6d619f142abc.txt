He’s also the head of the film music division at DreamWorks studios and additionally works with other composers through the company that he founded: Remote Control Productions.      Zimmer’s works are notable for integrating electronic music sounds with traditional orchestral arrangements. He has received four Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, a Classical BRIT Award, and an Academy Award. He was also named on the list of Top 100 Living Geniuses published by _The Daily Telegraph_.      Zimmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany on 12th September 1957, and moved to London as a teenager. While he lived in London, Zimmer wrote advertising jingles for Air-Edel Associates. Zimmer began his musical career playing keyboards and synthesisers. In 1980 he worked with [The Buggles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Buggles), a New Wave band formed in 1977 with Trevor Horn, Geoff Downs, and Bruce Woolley. Zimmer can be briefly seen in The Buggles music video for “Video Killed the Radio Star” (1979).      In the 1980s, Zimmer worked with film composer Stanley Myers, a prolific film composer who composed scores for over sixty films. Zimmer and Myers co-founded the London-based Lillie Yard recording studio. Together, Myers and Zimmer worked on fusing the traditional orchestral sound with state-of-the-art electronics. Some of their first movies with this new sound include “Moonlighting” (1982), “Success is the Best Revenge” (1984), “Insignificance” (1985), and “My Beautiful Launderette” (1985). In 1986, Zimmer joined [David Byrne](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Byrne) and [Ryuichi Sakamoto](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ryuichi+Sakamoto) on their Oscar-winning score for “The Last Emperor” (1988).      Soon afterwards, Zimmer began working on his own solo projects. During his solo career years, Zimmer experimented and combined the use of old and new musical technologies. His first solo score was for Chris Menges’s film “A World Apart” (1988). However, the turning point in his career came later that year when he was asked to compose a score for Barry Levinson’s film “Rain Man” (1988). In the score, Zimmer uses synthesizers mixed with steel drums. The score was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989
