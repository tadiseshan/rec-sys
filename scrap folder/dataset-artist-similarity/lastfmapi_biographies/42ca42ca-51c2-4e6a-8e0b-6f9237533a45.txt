Stars On 45 (known in some countries as Starsound) was a Dutch pop act, briefly very popular in the U.K., Europe and the U.S. in the early 1980s.      The project consisted of studio session musicians under the direction of [Jaap eggermont](http://www.last.fm/music/Jaap+eggermont), who was drummer of The Golden Earrings (the sixties incarnation of [Golden Earring](http://www.last.fm/music/Golden+Earring) in the latter half of the 1960s.      Stars On 45 popularised the medley by recreating hit songs as faithfully as possible and stringing them together with a common tempo and relentless underlying drum track. The point was to provide a danceable disco record using familiar tunes.      The first such release, [Stars On 45 Medley](http://www.last.fm/music/Stars+On+45/_/Stars+On+45+Medley), featuring songs from [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles), went to #1 in the U.S. and #2 in the U.K. Several follow-up records also proved highly succesful. Another release featured medleys using [ABBA](http://www.last.fm/music/ABBA) and Motown material, while a third featured medleys of [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones) and [Stevie Wonder](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder).      Trivia: one of their releases continues to hold the record for a #1 single with the longest name on the U.S. Billboard charts, due to the legalities requiring each song title be listed: [Intro/Venus/Sugar Sugar/No Reply/I’ll Be Back/Drive My Car/Do You Want to Know a Secret/We Can Work It Out/I Should Have Known Better/You’re Going to Lose That Girl/Stars on 45](http://www.last. fm/music/Stars+On+45/_/Intro%2FVenus%2FSugar+Sugar%2FNo+Reply%2FI%27ll+Be+Back %2FDrive+My+Car%2FDo+You+Want+to+Know+a+Secret%2FWe+Can+Work+It+Out%2FI+Should +Have+Known+Better%2FYou%27re+Going+to+Lose+That+Girl%2FStars+on+45).
