THE BIOGRAPHY OF KEMOPETROL ACCORDING TO KALLE      Hi. We are Kemopetrol. We’ve been around since 1998 and we’re still here. The dinosaurs.      There are four of us. We play music. And we write our own material, too. Laura sings, Marko strums the guitar, Teemu bangs the drums and I bang the synths.      We began as a duo, Marko & I. Then we met Laura and everything changed. We became good. Our friend Teemu noticed it and wanted to join. We accepted him because he looked so sad.      We’ve had bass players in the past, too. Wonderful guys who got lost in action.      We were lucky enough to get a record deal in 1999. Then everything happened almost too fast for us, I would say. The snowball was rolling and we were along for the ride, gathering fortune and fame (well, not REAL fortune and fame - it’s Finland, after all), playing gigs and having a blast
