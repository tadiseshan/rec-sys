Alpert’s musical accomplishments include five number one hits, twenty-eight albums on the Billboard charts, eight Grammy Awards, fourteen Platinum albums and fifteen Gold albums.

A couple of the greatest artists of the 60’s and 70’s that he got to shine on A&M records were The Carpenters and Natalie Cole.
