**Joanna Newsom** (born January 18, 1982) started taking piano lessons at a very early age and played for a couple of years, but switched to the harp at seven. Her approach to the harp, from the percussive aspects of her playing to her chord changes, was also influenced by West African and Venezuelan harp music, which she began studying at a folk music camp she attended in her early teens. At the same time, she also listened to more vocal-based [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk), [punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk), and [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) like [Karen Dalton](http://www.last.fm/music/Karen+Dalton), [Texas Gladden](http://www.last.fm/music/Texas+Gladden), [Patti Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+Smith), and [Billie Holiday](http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday). By the time she reached high-school age, Newsom decided she wanted to become a composer, and while that became the focus of her studies, in her free time she began writing and recording instrumental songs. Eventually, Newsom’s passion for songwriting won out, and she began studying creative writing to work with words in the same way she was accustomed to working with music.       Although Joanna Newsom’s Appalachian-meets-[avant- garde](http://www.last.fm/tag/avant-garde) take on [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) music is her most celebrated work, her range is even more inclusive than her solo career suggests: the classically trained harpist adds a decidedly different, textural sound to [Nervous Cop](http://www.last.fm/music/Nervous+Cop), the noise rock trio that also features [Deerhoof](http://www.last.fm/music/Deerhoof)’s Greg Saunier and [Hella](http://www.last.fm/music/Hella)’s Zach Hill, and she also plays keyboards for [The Pleased](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pleased), another San Francisco-area band more akin to [Blondie](http://www.last.fm/music/Blondie) or [Television](http://www.last.fm/music/Television) than her other projects. Newsom’s family and hometown of Nevada City, CA, were both musically rich: her mother trained to be a concert pianist, her father is a guitarist, and her brother and sister play the drums and cello, respectively; meanwhile, the Newsoms also counted composer/pianist [Terry Riley](http://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Riley) as a neighbor, along with Howard Hersh and W. Jay Sydeman.      Despite her extensive musical background, she hadn’t sung until she began concentrating on her songs, but her voice — which had a pure, untrained sound somewhere between a child and a crone — was the perfect complement to her music. Newsom recorded some collections of songs that she gave to her friends, but eventually her music made its way to likeminded musicians like [Will Oldham](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Oldham) and [Cat Power](http://www.last.fm/music/Cat+Power), both of whom invited her to play opening slots for their shows in 2002. That year also saw the release of the _[Walnut Whales](http://www.last
