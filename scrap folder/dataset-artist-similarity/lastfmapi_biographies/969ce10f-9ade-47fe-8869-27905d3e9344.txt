With a career spanning four decades, Misty in Roots are one of the UK’s finest [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae) groups. The band was one of the most powerful live reggae acts to emerge from 1970s London, and they were a major force in the Rock Against Racism movement.      This British based [roots reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/roots%20reggae) band Misty in Roots have played together for the past 20 years, first coming together in 1975 and working as a backing band for the late, great [Nicky Thomas](http://www.last.fm/music/Nicky+Thomas) \- one of Jamaica’s all time greats who had achieved national chart success with songs such as “Love Of The Common People”. Nicky Thomas was the inspiration from which Misty In Roots developed.      By 1978 Misty In Roots began to develop their own orthodox roots reggae sound. Their powerful lyrics inspired by the economic decline, a growing awareness of their African culture, and a spiritual awakening inspired tracks as “Ghetto Of The City”, “Sodom & Gomorrah” and “Mankind”, all off which can be found on the band’s first album “Live At The Counter Eurovision”.      During the period 1977-78 the political situation in the U.K. was a breaking point. Black consciousness was at its peak and racism roamed the streets of London. Unemployment was affecting both black and white youths and through this depression a new musical alliance was born, young white youths totally fed up with the status quo turned to playing punk music whilst at the same time identifying strongly with the British reggae acts as Misty In Roots, [Steel Pulse](http://www.last.fm/music/Steel+Pulse) and [Aswad](http://www.last.fm/music/Aswad). With the coming of the ‘Rock against Racism’ movement, the musical fight-back had begun, and for the first time black and white musicians were playing together on the same platform bringing about a totally new concept in musical awareness.      Misty In Roots, one of the most powerful live reggae acts to have come out of London, and noted for their powerful roots reggae sound, and uncompromising lyrical vibrations, became the major force in Rock Against Racism, playing more concerts than any other band in the movement. This opened up a whole new audience for the band who quickly developed a very strong cross over audience, playing with acts such as [Tom Robinson](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Robinson), [The Ruts](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ruts) and [Elvis Costello](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello).      Despite Misty In Roots’ huge success as a live act the band did not release their first album until 1979. The album Live At The Counter Eurovision, which was recorded live in Belgium during the band’s 1978 tour, is today still proclaimed by many critics as the best live reggae album of all time. Misty In Roots followed Live At The Counter Eurovision with a string of limited edition singles such as “Oh Wicked Man”, “Rich Man”, “Salvation”, “How Long Jah” and “See Them Ah Come”
