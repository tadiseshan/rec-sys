Biography      Fabienne Demal, better known to European music fans as Axelle Red, was born in the north of Belgium, in the Flemish town of Hasselt, on February 15 1968. She was thus brought up in an environment where everyone spoke Dutch. But Axelle’s parents were both originally from Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium, and at home they would speak to their daughter in French as well as Dutch. So Axelle grew up speaking both languages fluently. (This talent would serve the singer well in later life, for she was able to record her songs in Dutch as well as French and build up a strong following of fans across the whole of Belgium). Axelle’s parents would also encourage their daughter’s passion for music, introducing her to the sound of legendary American soul stars such as Aretha Franklin - a singer whom Axelle Red still cites as one of her greatest musical influences.      Axelle’s passion for music intensified during her teenage years and, besides her love of soul music, she also became a committed Abba fan, learning all the Swedish supergroup’s hits by heart. The young teenager also devoted a great deal of time and energy to dance lessons.      Axelle soon proved to have a powerful singing voice and, at the tender age of 15, she was spotted by a talent scout from a Belgian record company. Axelle was immediately invited into the studio to record her first single - and, as they say in the music world, the rest is history. The single “Little Girls” went rocketing to the top of the Belgian Top 50 in 1983, catapulting the young Axelle Red to overnight stardom.      Encouraged by this early success, Axelle began spending more time in the studio and she eventually went on to record a highly accomplished demo tape. In 1985 Axelle’s tape would fall into the hands of the English guitarist Mick Ronson (famous for his work with rock legend David Bowie). Ronson was greatly impressed by Axelle’s voice and put forward the idea of producing an album with the young Belgian singer. Unfortunately, Ronson’s record label, Redbus, rejected the idea of releasing an album by a relative unknown and the project bit the dust. But Axelle gained a great deal of confidence from this experience
