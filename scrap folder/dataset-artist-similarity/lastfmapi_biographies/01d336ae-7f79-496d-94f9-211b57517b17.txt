Sugar Minott (born Lincoln Barrington Minott, May 25, 1956 in Kingston, died Saturday July 10, 2010 in Kingston) was a [jamaican](http://www.last.fm/tag/jamaican) [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae) singer, producer and sound-system operator known for his sweet roots dancehall style.      Sugar Minott spent his youth hanging around the legendary “Studio 1” listening to the artists that recorded there, such as [Alton Ellis](http://www.last.fm/music/Alton+Ellis), [Ken Boothe](http://www.last.fm/music/Ken+Boothe), [The Heptones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Heptones), [Dennis Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/Dennis+Brown) and others.      Sugar began his career with the formation of the [African Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/African+Brothers), along with [Tony Tuff](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Tuff) and Derek Howard (and later [Triston Palmer](http://www.last.fm/music/Triston+Palmer)) in the early 1970s. The African Brothers were a harmonious roots act, of which Sugar became the most popular member. By 1979, Sugar had been invited by Studio 1 to record a solo album.      When recording at Studio 1, he chose not to use a backing band as in conventional recording, but elected to sing over instrumental versions of old Studio 1 classics. This is considered to be the birth of “dancehall,” which lead to countless artists making new hits out of old classics, a tradition that continues in Jamaica today.      Sugar was also well-regarded for hard work on his [Youthman Promotion](http://www.last.fm/music/Youthman+Promotion) sound system and Black Roots & Youthman Promotion labels into the 1980s, which brought forth such artists as [Tenor Saw](http://www.last.fm/music/Tenor+Saw), [Nitty Gritty](http://www.last.fm/music/Nitty+Gritty), [Yami Bolo](http://www.last.fm/music/Yami+Bolo), [Junior Reid](http://www.last.fm/music/Junior+Reid), [Tony Rebel](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Rebel), [Garnett Silk](http://www.last.fm/music/Garnett+Silk), and many more to the industry. Up until his death, he was still working with young artists both in Jamaica and the US, including his daughter [Pashon](http://www.last.fm/music/Pashon) Minott.
