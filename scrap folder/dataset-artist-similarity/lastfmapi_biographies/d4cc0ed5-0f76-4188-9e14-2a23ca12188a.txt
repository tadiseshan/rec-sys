With a solo career spanning the genres of rock, blues, and gospel, Russell began his musical career at 14, lying about his age to land a gig playing backup at a Tulsa nightclub to play with [Ronnie Hawkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Ronnie+Hawkins) behind Jerry Lee Lewis. Two years later, after settling in Los Angeles, he studied guitar with [James Burton](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Burton), and worked sessions with [Dorsey Burnette](http://www.last.fm/music/Dorsey+Burnette) and [Glen Campbell](http://www.last.fm/music/Glen+Campbell).      After becoming a part of Phil Spector’s studio group, Russell played backup on many of the most popular hits of the 1960s, including [The Byrds](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Byrds), [Gary Lewis and The Playboys](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Lewis+and+The+Playboys), and [Herb Alpert](http://www.last.fm/music/Herb+Alpert). He also served as Snuff Garrett’s assistant on numerous productions. Russell built his own recording studio in 1967, and recorded his first LP, [Look Inside The Asylum Choir](http://www.last.fm/music/Asylum+Choir/Look+Inside+The+Asylum+Choir), in a collaboration with [Marc Benno](http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Benno).      His first songwriting hit was [Joe Cocker](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Cocker)’s 1970 cover of “[Delta Lady](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Cocker/_/Delta+Lady)”, and Russell went on to organise Cocker’s [Mad Dogs and Englishmen](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Cocker/Mad+Dogs+and+Englishmen) tour. Shortly thereafter, Russell released another solo album, [Leon Russell](http://www.last.fm/music/Leon+Russell/Leon+Russell), which included the original version of the popular “[A Song for You](http://www.last.fm/music/Leon+Russell/_/A+Song+for+You)”.

During the 60’s and 70’s, Russell had a large mansion home in Tulsa near Woodward Park and was much an attraction for teenagers growing up in Tulsa. He also owned the infamous Church Recording Studio on 3rd street there, a meeting place for Russell and many friends. The Church Studio is now owned by Glen Mitchell and one-time Russell studio engineer Steve Ripley of the country band [The Tractors](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Tractors).
