**Mobb Deep** is a [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) duo made up of [Havoc](http://www.last.fm/music/Havoc) and [Prodigy](http://www.last.fm/music/Prodigy). Both members are natives of [Queensbridge](http://www.last.fm/tag/queensbridge), [New York](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20york); located in Long Island City. They are perhaps most famous for their landmark album, _The Infamous_, and the accompanying hit single, Shook Ones Pt. II.      **1992–1994: Early Career**      Prodigy and Havoc met one another while attending the prestigious High School of Art & Design in Manhattan. Coming from similar backgrounds, the duo broke into the [rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/rap) game in 1992. Growing up in hostile environments that included the prevalence of poverty, drugs, and gang violence, Mobb Deep attempted to express their life experiences through rapping circa 1992. Before Havoc and P were known as Mobb Deep they were a couple of teenaged rappers known as Poetical Profits. The world first heard of them via the Source’s Unsigned Hype column and this is the demo track that was quoted in that feature. The song would later see the light of day on their debut LP Juvenile Hell.      “Flavor 4 The Non Believers” (demo version) They released their first album, _Juvenille Hell_, in 1993.

Because both Prodigy and Havoc were still in their teens at the time of their debut, many were surprised by the violent nature of the album. Although the album was not well-received by the public, it displayed the raw talent of the duo; the unique chemistry of Prodigy’s lyrical delivery combined with Havoc’s melancholy beats. Through this unique style, the duo were signed by Loud Records, and began recording their sophomore album, _The Infamous_, in 1995, which would establish the duo in the Hardcore hip hop community.      **1995–2000: Rise to Success**      Following its release, _The Infamous_ became perhaps one of the most influential hip hop albums of the East Coast [hardcore rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/hardcore%20rap) genre.
