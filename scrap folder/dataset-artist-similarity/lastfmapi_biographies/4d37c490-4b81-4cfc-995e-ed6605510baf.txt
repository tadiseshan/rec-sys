**Mutya Buena** (born 21 May 1985) is a British recording artist who rose to fame in the early 2000s as a member of girl group, [Sugababes](http://www.last.fm/music/Sugababes) until her departure in December 2005. She released a solo album, Real Girl in 2007, which contained a number of hit singles. In October 2010 she announced that she would not be pursuing her career in music any further and would be concentrating on becoming a child psychologist. Buena returned to music in 2011 after taking time to raise her daughter. Her comeback single, “Give Me Love”, was released in May 2011. In July 2012, it was officially confirmed that the original line-up had reformed under the name Mutya Keisha Siobhan.      The first glimpse of new material came to light on 7 January 2013 when the group uploaded an short a cappella clip of their debut single “Boys” on Keisha Buchanan’s YouTube account.      The original line-up of the group featured a group of friends [Keisha Buchanan](http://www.last.fm/music/Keisha+Buchanan), [Siobhán Donaghy](http://www.last.fm/music/Siobh%C3%A1n+Donaghy) and Buena. Buena and Buchanan were friends from school and met Donaghy at a music recording studio in 1998. Since gaining a record deal, the band have gone on to become one of the most successful U.K. girl groups in the history of British music, second only to the Spice Girls in terms of record sales. They have had four platinum selling albums, six number one singles and a BRIT-Award as well as a platinum- selling greatest hits album.      Following an apparent illness that prevented Buena from promoting the follow- up single [Ugly](http://www.last.fm/music/Sugababes/_/Ugly), it was announced on 21 December 2005 that Buena had left Sugababes. According to an announcement on their site, “Buena’s decision was based purely on personal reasons and she will continue to remain the best of friends with both”. It was found that Buchanan wanted to stay friends with Buena but found it hard as she never sees her. The last remaining original member, Buchanan, said upon Buena’s departure, “…we will all miss Mutya, but we also knew there was still a place for bringing in somebody new who could help us carry on taking the Sugababes brand of music forward”…” Amelle Berrabah joined the group just 48 hours after Buena’s departure. Berrabah was chosen by the group’s management and “instantly knew she was the only person to share the rest of the journey with us.”      Since her departure from the Sugababes, Buena has worked with a range of record producers, singers and musicians, including [Amy Winehouse](http://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Winehouse), [George Michael](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Michael) and dance music writers [Groove Armada](http://www.last.fm/music/Groove+Armada).      Buena began working on her debut album in early 2006, after signing with her previous label Universal Island Records. The first single to be released in the U.K
