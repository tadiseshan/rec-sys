Amazingly, Darlene Love, a superb vocalist, hasn’t had much of a track record as a solo singer, at least not in terms of hits. Love was a founding member of [The Blossoms](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Blossoms) in 1957. They did several sessions and were resident singers on the television show Shindig. Love sang lead vocals on ” [He’s A Rebel](http://www.last.fm/music/Darlene+Love/_/He%27s+A+Rebel),” which was credited to [The Crystals](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Crystals), and “[Zip-A -Dee-Doo-Dah](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+B.+Soxx+and+the+Bluejeans/_/Zip-A -Dee-Doo-Dah),” which was issued as [Bob B. Soxx and the Bluejeans](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+B.+Soxx+and+the+Bluejeans). She cut six singles for [Phil Spector](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Spector)’s Phillies label, with ” Wait Till My Bobby Gets Back Home” the most successful. Love became busy as an actress, but reunited with Spector for the 1977 single ” [Lord, If You’re A Woman](http://www.last.fm/music/Darlene+Love/_/Lord,+If+You%27re+A+Woman).” Love appeared in all four Lethal Weapon films, and was also in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s co-production of Stephen King’s Carrie. Her 1990 LP, [Paint Another Picture](http://www.last.fm/music/Darlene+Love/Paint+Another+Picture), failed to chart in America. Love later toured as a background vocalist with Cher. She appeared briefly on the soap opera Another World in 1993.
