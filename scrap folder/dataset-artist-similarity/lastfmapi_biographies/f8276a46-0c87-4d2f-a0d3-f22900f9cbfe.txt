Maria McKee (born Maria Louise McKee, on August 17, 1964 in Los Angeles, California) is an American singer and songwriter. She is best known for her work with [Lone Justice](http://www.last.fm/music/Lone+Justice) and for her 1990 UK solo chart-topping hit, “Show Me Heaven”. In 1986, she wrote [Feargal Sharkey](http://www.last.fm/music/Feargal+Sharkey)’s UK number one hit ‘A Good Heart’.      McKee is the half-sister of [Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Love) guitarist [Bryan MacLean](http://www.last.fm/music/Bryan+MacLean), with whom she played in a duo as a teenager. In 1982 McKee was a founding member of the cowpunk/country rock band [Lone Justice](http://www.last.fm/music/Lone+Justice) with whom she released two albums. Her band opened for such acts as U2.      She released her first solo, self-titled album in 1989. Her song “Show Me Heaven”, which appeared on the soundtrack to the film Days of Thunder, was a number one single in the United Kingdom for four weeks in 1990. Later her eerie, country-tinged single, “If Love Is a Red Dress (Hang Me in Rags)” was released on the soundtrack of Pulp Fiction. (1994).      Her recorded output has varied between the rootsy country-folk of You Gotta Sin To Get Saved (1993) and Peddlin’ Dreams (2005), and experimental rock on Life Is Sweet (1996) and High Dive (2003). She even made a foray into early- 90s dance music with her “Sweetest Child” single.      Life Is Sweet was seen at the time as an artistic about-face from her country- rock sound, full of guitar feedback and complex, baroque songwriting. Confounding both fans and critics, it was her last release for seven years and her last for a major label.      In 2007 she released Late December, an album rooted in classic 60s pop songwriting.      She is the half-sister of [Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Love) guitarist/singer/songwriter [Bryan MacLean](http://www.last.fm/music/Bryan+MacLean), with whom she played in a duo as a teenager. In the nineties, she spent time living in Dublin and the East Village.
