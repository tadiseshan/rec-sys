There is more than one band called Mishka.      This one is Mishka Frith. Like his older sister, singer/songwriter Heather Nova (born Heather Frith), pop-reggae singer Mishka grew up at sea, traveling from island to island in the West Indies on his Canadian mother and Bermudian fatherâ€™s sailboat, where he received most of his education and listened to whatever music he could. When his parents returned to Canada, he completed school and returned to the Caribbean, eventually becoming a competitive windsurfer and representing Bermuda at international meets. In the meantime, he had also taken up songwriting, and he chanced to meet and impress Creation Records head Alan McGee with his vocal ability in late 1996; with prodding from Nova, Mishka was signed to a record contract the following year. His eponymous debut album, a mix of pop, reggae, soul, and singer/songwriter folk- rock, was released in 1999.      The other Mishka is from Ireland, currently living in America. Fronted by Lauren Norton. They have one EP - 47 Varieties Of Hindsight. Myspace: [www.myspace.com/mihskamusik](http://www.myspace.com/mihskamusik)
