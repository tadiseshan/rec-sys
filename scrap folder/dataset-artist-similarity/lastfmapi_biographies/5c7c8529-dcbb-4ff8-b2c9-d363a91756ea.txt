Deborah Ann Gibson, credited as both [Deborah Gibson](http://www.last.fm/music/Deborah+Gibson) and Debbie Gibson (born August 31, 1970 in Brooklyn, NY, United States), is an American singer- songwriter, and record producer who was initially a teen idol appearing repeatedly on the cover of such teen magazines as Tiger Beat. In contrast to the prevalence of the name Debbie in her teen-idol phase, she showed a preference for “Deborah” even then, and her fans had, before the release of [Naked](http://www.last.fm/music/Deborah+Gibson/_/Naked), signalled a departure from that image by using this name to refer to her.      When Gibson turned 16 years old in 1986, she was signed to a recording contract by Atlantic Records, and soon she became the youngest person ever to write, record and produce a Number 1 hit, with her single [Foolish Beat](http://www.last.fm/music/Debbie+Gibson/_/Foolish+Beat). Three other singles from her debut LP [Out Of The Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Debbie+Gibson/Out+of+the+Blue) also cracked the top 5 Billboard Top 100: [Only In My Dreams](http://www.last.fm/music/Debbie+Gibson/_/Only+in+My+Dreams), [Out Of The Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Debbie+Gibson/_/Out+of+the+Blue), and [Shake Your Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Debbie+Gibson/_/Shake+Your+Love).      By the time [Out Of The Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Debbie+Gibson/Out+of+the+Blue) was established as a hit album, she and [Tiffany](http://www.last.fm/music/Tiffany), with her remake of [I Think We’re Alone Now](http://www.last.fm/music/Tiffany/_/I+Think+We%27re+Alone+Now), were fighting for the top position as teen queen of the United States. She also had considerable success in the UK, as well as Japan and south east Asia. During the early 1990s, she released to albums “Anything Is Possible” (1990) and “Mind Body Soul” (1993).      In 1995, she signed with EMI’s SBK Records division and recorded what would be her only album for the label, [Think With Your Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Debbie+Gibson/Think+With+Your+Heart). After parting company with EMI, Gibson formed her own record label to release her original material. Controversially for some of her fans who were more comfortable with her earlier wholesome image, the March 2005 issue of Playboy featured a nude pictorial with Gibson, the publication of which also coincided with the release of her single, [Naked](http://www.last.fm/music/Deborah+Gibson/_/Naked).      In 2005, Gibson co-wrote and recorded a song titled [Someone You Love](http:// www.last.fm/music/The+O%27Neill+Brothers+%28With+Deborah+Gibson%29/_/Someone+Y ou+Love) with [The O’Neill Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+O%27Neill+Brothers). With [The O’Neill Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+O%27Neill+Brothers), Gibson also released an updated, acoustic version of her former number 1 hit [Lost In Your Eyes](http://www.last.fm/music/Debbie+Gibson/_/Lost+In+Your+Eyes).      Deborah’s ninth album “Ms. Vocalist” was released in late 2010
