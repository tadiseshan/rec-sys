**Edie Brickell** is an American singer/songwriter, born March 10, 1966 in Dallas (Oak Cliff), Texas.      In the late 1980s Brickell was the lead singer with the (now renamed) folk- rock group [Edie Brickell & New Bohemians](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirec t/Edie+Brickell+&+New+Bohemians), whose 1988 debut album _Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars_ was a critical and commercial success. The band’s follow-up album, _Ghost of a Dog_ (1990), fared less well. As a solo artist, Brickell released _Picture Perfect Morning_ (1994) and _Volcano_ (2003). In 2006 she reunited with some of the original members of [The New Bohemians](http://www.last.fm/music/The+New+Bohemians) and they released the _Stranger Things_ album.      Brickell had a role as a folk singer in the 1989 film _Born on the Fourth of July_. Her version of [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan)’s “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” is featured on the film’s soundtrack. Many computer users know her from the “Good Times” video which was included as part of the multimedia samples on the Windows 95 installation CD-ROM.      Brickell married songwriter [Paul Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon) in 1992. They have three children.
