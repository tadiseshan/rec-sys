[Cub Koda](http://www.last.fm/music/Cub+Koda) wrote, “Of all the early breakthrough rock & roll artists, none is more important to the development of the music than Chuck Berry. He is its greatest songwriter, the main shaper of its instrumental voice, one of its greatest guitarists, and one of its greatest performers.” [John Lennon](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon) was more succinct: “If you tried to give rock and roll another name, you might call it ‘Chuck Berry’.”      Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986. He received Kennedy Center Honors in 2000 in a “class” with [Mikhail Baryshnikov](http://www.last.fm/music/Mikhail+Baryshnikov), [Plácido Domingo](http://www.last.fm/music/Pl%C3%A1cido+Domingo), [Angela Lansbury](http://www.last.fm/music/Angela+Lansbury), and [Clint Eastwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Clint+Eastwood).

Chuck Berry held a special place, in terms of sound development, in the formation of, Mersey-Beat at Liverpool.   The finest exponent of Chuck Berry, guitar, sound at Liverpool during 1959 to 1963, was Vincent Tow/Ismail, who in turn passed on many of the learned skills to Lennon & McCartney, his friends and colleagues during that period—1959 to 1962/3.      Chuck Berry also influenced many of the great rock ‘n’ roll bands that we know today including The Rolling Stones and The Beatles.
