Wainwright was born in Rhinebeck, New York, USA, to folk singers [Loudon Wainwright III](http://www.last.fm/music/Loudon+Wainwright+III) and [Kate McGarrigle](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+McGarrigle) (they divorced while he was a child). He began to play the piano at age six, and by age thirteen he was touring with his sister [Martha Wainwright](http://www.last.fm/music/Martha+Wainwright), mother Kate, and aunt Anna as the **[McGarrigle Sisters and Family](http://www.last.fm/music/McGarrigle+Sisters+and+Family)**.   His song [I’m A-Runnin’](http://www.last.fm/music/Rufus+Wainwright/_/I%27m+A-Runnin%27), which he performed in the movie _Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller_ (in which he also played a minor character), was nominated for the 1989 Genie Award for Best Original Song and earned him a nomination for the 1990 Juno Award for Most Promising Male Vocalist.      He lived in Montreal with his mother for most of his childhood and briefly attended McGill University, where he studied both classical and ‘rock’ piano. Some of his songs feature his mastery of French. Wainwright still maintains a residence in Canada.      He came out as gay while still a teen.      Wainwright became interested in opera throughout his adolescent years (for instance, his track [Barcelona](http://www.last.fm/music/Rufus+Wainwright/_/Barcelona) features lyrics of [Giuseppe Verdi](http://www.last.fm/music/Giuseppe+Verdi)). He also became an enthusiast of such performers as [Édith Piaf](http://www.last.fm/music/%C3%89dith+Piaf), [Al Jolson](http://www.last.fm/music/Al+Jolson) and [Judy Garland](http://www.last.fm/music/Judy+Garland).      After having been a fixture on the Montreal club circuit, Wainwright cut a series of demo tapes, one of which found itself in the hands of DreamWorks executive Lenny Waronker. The label signed him and he released the self-titled [Rufus Wainwright](http://www.last.fm/music/Rufus+Wainwright/Rufus+Wainwright) album in the spring of 1998. This album received much critical acclaim in Canada, and was recognized by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the best albums of the year. Wainwright’s second album, [Poses](http://www.last.fm/music/Rufus+Wainwright/Poses) (2001), brought similar acclaim.      Wainwright’s first main exposure to the American public came as an opener to singer [Tori Amos](http://www.last.fm/music/Tori+Amos) in 2001 and 2002. He garnered praise for his performance and began touring as a main act shortly afterwards. He has frequently toured as the opener for [Sting](http://www.last.fm/music/Sting) and co-headlined with [Ben Folds](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Folds) and [Guster](http://www.last.fm/music/Guster) in the summer of 2004
