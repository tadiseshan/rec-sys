Albert King (April 25, 1923 – December 21, 1992) was an American [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) [guitarist](http://www.last.fm/tag/guitarist) and singer.      One of the “Three Kings of the Blues Guitar” (along with [B.B. King](http://www.last.fm/music/B.B.+King) and [Freddie King](http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+King)), Albert King stood 6’ 4”, weighed 250 lbs and was known as “The Velvet Bulldozer”. He was born Albert Nelson on a cotton plantation in Indianola, [mississippi](http://www.last.fm/tag/mississippi). During his childhood he would sing at a family [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel) group at a church. One of 13 children, King grew up picking cotton on plantations near Forrest City, Arkansas where the family moved when he was eight years old. He began his professional work as a musician with a group called In The Groove Boys in Osceola, Arkansas. He had also briefly played drums for [Jimmy Reed](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Reed)’s band and on several early Reed recordings. Influenced by blues musicians [Blind Lemon Jefferson](http://www.last.fm/music/Blind+Lemon+Jefferson) and [Lonnie Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/Lonnie+Johnson), but also interestingly [hawaiian](http://www.last.fm/tag/hawaiian) music, the [electric guitar](http://www.last.fm/tag/electric%20guitar) became his signature instrument, his preference being the Gibson Flying V, which he named “Lucy”.      King was a [left-handed](http://www.last.fm/tag/left-handed) “upside- down/backwards” [guitarist](http://www.last.fm/tag/guitarist). He was left- handed, but usually played right-handed guitars flipped over upside-down so the low E string was on the bottom. In later years he played a custom-made [guitar](http://www.last.fm/tag/guitar) that was basically left-handed, but had the strings reversed (as he was used to playing). He also used very unorthodox tunings (i.e., tuning as low as C to allow him to make sweeping string bends). Some believe that he was using open E minor tuning (C-B-E-G-B-E) or open F tuning (C-F-C-F-A-D). A “less is more” type blues player, he was known for his expressive “bending” of notes, a technique characteristic of [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) guitarists.      He recorded his first record in 1953 for Parrot Records in [chicago](http://www.last.fm/tag/chicago), but it had no impact. His first minor hit came in 1959 with [Lonely Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Albert+King/_/Lonely+Man) written by Bobbin Records A&R man and fellow guitar hero [Little Milton](http://www.last.fm/music/Little+Milton), responsible for King’s signing with the label. However, it was not until his 1961 release [Don’t Throw Your Love on Me so Strong](http://www.last.fm/music/Albert+King/_/Don%27 t+Throw+Your+Love+on+Me+so+Strong) that he had a major hit, reaching number fourteen on the U.S. Billboard  R&B chart. In 1966 he signed with the [Stax](http://www.last.fm/label/Stax) record label. Produced by Al Jackson, Jr., King with [Booker T
