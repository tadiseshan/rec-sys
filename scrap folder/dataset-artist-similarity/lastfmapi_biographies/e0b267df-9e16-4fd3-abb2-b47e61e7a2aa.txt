Originally born into [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) through break dancing, **Brother Ali** has been one with the mic since he first heard [Miilkbone](http://www.last.fm/music/Miilkbone) on record. A student of Hip- Hop’s golden age, Ali’s music ranges from purpose to passionate, yet always soulful and true to the boastful heritage of hip hop culture. An [emcee](http://www.last.fm/tag/emcee), [producer](http://www.last.fm/tag/producer), host and overall party-starter, [Brother Ali](http://www.last.fm/music/Brother+Ali)’s talents are a well- defined addition to the [Rhymesayers](http://www.rhymesayers.com) family.      In spring of 2000, Ali dropped a sixty-minute story telling and thought sharing album titled, _Rites of Passage_ on Rhymesayers Entertainment. The self-produced cassette-only anthology introduced Brother Ali’s beat making muscles and extensive writing skills. He played the congas, beat-boxed and still found time to lay out his views on the music industry, religion and urban life in [America](http://www.last.fm/place/united%20states).      On stage with only a [DJ](http://www.last.fm/tag/dj), Ali’s magical gift for capturing the imagination of his audience has been compared to that of a gospel preacher. His voice, large stature and albino features make him a unique and commanding presence. Brother Ali has perfected the live performance, having played countless shows with: [Guru](http://www.last.fm/music/Guru), [Mos Def](http://www.last.fm/music/Mos+Def), [De La Soul](http://www.last.fm/music/De+La+Soul), [El-P](http://www.last.fm/music/El-P), [Aceyalone](http://www.last.fm/music/Aceyalone), [Souls of Mischief](http://www.last.fm/music/Souls+of+Mischief) and [Living Legends](http://www.last.fm/music/Living+Legends) just to name a few. From September through November 2002, Ali earned his final road-dog tags showcasing his individual skills performing 63 shows in 71 days with [Atmosphere](http://www.last.fm/music/Atmosphere) and [Murs](http://www.last.fm/music/Murs) covering North America.      Brother Ali has maintained credibility over time with guest appearances on many such projects as: [DJ Abilities](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Abilities)’, _For Persons With DJ Abilities_, [Bk one](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bk+one)’s, _For the Love of Music_, _The Phoenix_ with [Musab](http://www.last.fm/music/Musab) on the Twin Cities Music Year Book 2001 CD, producing six songs on [Musab](http://www.last.fm/music/Musab)’s, _Respect The Life_ album and battling in the 2000 and 2001 finals in the annual Scribble Jam MC Battles (Ali is featured on three of the Scribble Jam videos: Scribble Jam 2000, Scribble Jam 2001 and the Best of Scribble Jam).      Ali joined producer [ANT](http://www.last.fm/music/ANT) (of Atmosphere fame) and went to work creating an intensely powerful album that promised to be one of the foremost efforts of 2003
