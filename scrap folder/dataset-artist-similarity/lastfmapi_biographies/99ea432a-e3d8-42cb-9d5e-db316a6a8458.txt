**Nick Drake** (Nicholas Rodney Drake, Rangoon, Burma, June 19, 1948 - Tanworth-in-Arden, England, November 25, 1974) was an English [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) singer known for his gentle, enigmatic songs and his virtuoso right-hand finger picking technique.      Although he recorded only three albums, critics and fellow musicians hold his work in very high esteem. Drake failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, and had a strong aversion to performing. Since his death, however, Drake’s music has gained a significant cult following.      Drake’s father worked as an engineer. Although he was born in Rangoon, Burma, Nick’s family moved back to England soon afterward, and Drake was brought up in Tanworth-in-Arden, a small village in the English county of Warwickshire. He went to public school at Marlborough College, where he learned to play the clarinet and piano. As a young adult, Drake enrolled in Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, to study English. His older sister, Gabrielle Drake, is an actress.      Drake was a fan of [British](http://www.last.fm/place/united%20kingdom) and the emerging [American](http://www.last.fm/place/united%20states) [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) music scene, including artists [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan) and [Phil Ochs](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Ochs). While a university student, Drake began performing in local clubs and coffee houses. He was discovered by [Ashley Hutchings](http://www.last.fm/music/Ashley+Hutchings), the bass player of the [folk rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk%20rock) group [Fairport Convention](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairport+Convention). Hutchings introduced Drake to the other members of Fairport Convention, folk singer [John Martyn](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Martyn) and producer Joe Boyd.      He delayed attendance to spend six months at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, beginning in February 1967. While in Aix, he began to practice guitar in earnest, and to earn money would often busk with friends in the town centre. Drake began to smoke cannabis, and that spring he travelled with friends to Morocco, because, according to travelling companion Richard Charkin, “that was where you got the best pot”. Drake’s associates convinced [Island](http://www.last.fm/label/Island) Records to sign the young [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) to a three-album contract. Drake began recording his debut album _[Five Leaves Left](http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Drake/Five+Leaves+Left)_ later in 1968, with Boyd assuming the role of producer. The sessions took place in Sound Techniques studio, London, with Drake skipping lectures to travel by train to the capital. At the age of twenty, he released his first album _[Five Leaves Left](http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Drake/Five+Leaves+Left)_ (1969), which featured a [chamber music](http://www.last.fm/tag/chamber%20music) quartet on several songs and had a light, breezy sound
