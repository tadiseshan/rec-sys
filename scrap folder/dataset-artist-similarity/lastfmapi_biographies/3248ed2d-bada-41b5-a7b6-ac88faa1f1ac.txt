Robin Lynn Macy was an original bandmember, as was Laura Lynch . Macy left the group in 1992, while Lynch was replaced by Natalie Maines in 1995.      The group aroused considerable controversy for publicly denouncing President George W. Bush and the imminent invasion of Iraq during the European leg of their Top of the World tour supporting _Home_. Many country music stations immediately pulled their music from the air, and the band received criticism from many corners of the media.      Dixie Chicks released their latest album _Taking the Long Way_ on May 23, 2006. All fourteen tracks were co-written by the Dixie Chicks and produced by Rick Rubin. This album received five Grammy Awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group for “Not Ready to Make Nice,” and Album of the Year and Best Country Album.
