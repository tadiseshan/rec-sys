Butterfly Boucher (pronounced ‘bow-cher’ with a hard “ch” sound, unlike the French pronunciation) is an Adelaide, Australian singer/songwriter.      Boucher, born June 2, 1979, is the middle child of seven daughters. The name “Butterfly” was a suggestion from a friend of the family. Her mother didn’t initially like the name but kept seeing butterflies in pictures, on clothing, etc. before the birth. In later years, Butterfly’s sister had a band, The Mercy Bell, in which Butterfly played bass guitar. In 2004 and 2005, Boucher toured the U.S. and Canada, opening for Sarah McLachlan and Barenaked Ladies.      Butterfly currently resides in the United States. She released her first track of the album, “I Can’t Make Me,” in the UK first. It did poorly. However, when she released that track along with “Another White Dash,” her U.S. success was assured. While a second album is in the pipeline, there is no official date for its release.      Boucher sang David Bowie’s “Changes” with Bowie on the soundtrack for Shrek 2.      Boucher sang “I’m Different” on the “For The Kids Too” CD which was released in 2004 and is currently available on iTunes.      A remix of Boucher’s single, “I Can’t Make Me” is featured on “Charmed: The Book Of Shadows,” a soundtrack from the television show on The WB.      Boucher’s songs “Life is Short” and “Never Leave Your Heart Alone” were featured on the hit show “Grey’s Anatomy” during the first season. And the track “Bitter Song” was featured during season 3 of that same show.      From July 22 to Aug 6, 2008, Boucher toured with nine other artists from Tennessee as part of the [Ten out of Tenn tour](http://www.myspace.com/tenoutoftenn).      **Web Presence**      Butterfly keeps an online blog on MySpace, where she often uploads previews of new or previously unreleased songs.
