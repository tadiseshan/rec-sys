**Paul Rodgers** (known as “The Voice”) is a vocalist known for his work in the popular British [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) bands [Free](http://www.last.fm/music/Free), [The Firm](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Firm), and [Bad Company](http://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Company) as well as his solo career. He more recently stood in on vocals on a tour with [Brian May](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+May) and [Roger Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Taylor) of [Queen](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen) as a new collaboration titled [Queen + Paul Rodgers](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen+%252B+Paul+Rodgers). On this tour, Paul stressed that he was not trying to replace the band’s deceased singer, [Freddie Mercury](http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Mercury), but tried his best to give his own style to the songs.      Queen and Paul parted ways amicably in 2009, with Paul remarking that he would like to get back together in the future to raise money for charity. Paul has since reunited with [Bad Company](http://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Company), and they toured in 2010. Over the years, he’s also successfully toured and released albums with his own group centered around him. Paul is ranked number 55 on Rolling Stone magazine’s “100 Greatest Singers of All Time”. His work has been long influenced by American [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) and [rock n roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20n%20roll), and he helped play a role in the [70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s) [arena rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/arena%20rock) and [hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock) scenes both in the U.K. and the U.S.
