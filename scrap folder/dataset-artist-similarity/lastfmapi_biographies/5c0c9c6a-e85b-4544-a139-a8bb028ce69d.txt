Kate Elizabeth Voegele (born December 8, 1986) is an actress, singer, songwriter, guitarist, and pianist from the Cleveland suburb of Bay Village, Ohio, [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States). Voegele attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio through spring of 2007 as an Art Education major, leaving to focus on a music career afterwards. Voegele’s band includes [Chris Miranda](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Miranda) on guitar, and [Mark Tobik](http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Tobik) on bass.      Voegele began gaining interest from record labels and management companies after recording a series of demos. The first demo “[The Other Side](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Voegele/The+Other+Side)” (released in 2003) was produced by multi-platinum, award winning producer [Michael Seifert](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Seifert). Her second demo “[Louder Than Words](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Voegele/Louder+Than+Words)” (released in 2004) was produced by [Marshall Altman](http://www.last.fm/music/Marshall+Altman). Kate signed a record deal with Myspace Records in 2006 and released her debut album “[Don’t Look Away](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Voegele/Don%27t+Look+Away)” (produced by [Marshall Altman](http://www.last.fm/music/Marshall+Altman)) in May of 2007.      Kate Voegele recently began a recurring guest spot in six episodes of The CW television series “[One Tree Hill](http://www.last.fm/tag/one+tree+hill)” on Tuesday, January 22, 2008. Voegele plays Mia, a young singer and keyboardist for a rock band fronted by Jason ([Kevin Federline](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Federline)). After Peyton ([Hilarie Burton](http://www.last.fm/music/Hilarie+Burton)) signs the band to her upstart record label and becomes increasingly frustrated with Jason’s attitude, she eventually drops him and the rest of the band, but retains Mia as a developing new artist at the insistence of Haley ([Bethany Joy Galeotti](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bethany+Joy+Galeotti)), who is somewhat well-versed in the music industry as well. Mia performs songs on the series from Voegele’s real-life debut album “[Don’t Look Away](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Voegele/Don%27t+Look+Away)” including “[Kindly Unspoken](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Voegele/_/Kindly+Unspoken)” in her very first episode.      Kate Voegele performed several songs from her debut album “[Don’t Look Away](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Voegele/Don%27t+Look+Away)” on the The Early Show, Saturday, February 2, 2008 on CBS television network nationally. Kate’s band member Sam provided backup vocals and beat box support while Mark played the bass guitar.      In the spring, Kate embarked on a world-wind tour, opening up for the rock band Hanson on their 2008 Walk Tour and gaining a reputation in the music business that will surely be worth remembering.
