Ashley Parker Angel is a musician, formerly known as a member of the now- defunct boy band [O-Town](http://www.last.fm/music/O-Town). His first solo album, titled [Soundtrack To Your Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Ashley+Parker+Angel/Soundtrack+To+Your+Life), was released on May 16th by [Blackground Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Blackground+Records). It debuted at #5 on the Billboard 200, selling over 72,000 copies.      **O-Town**   During the production of the reality show that gave birth to O-Town, _Making the Band_, many of Ashley’s co-workers considered him perfect for the role of a boy band member, as a result of his passion, enthusiasm, talent, and boyish good looks. He is often considered the group’s heartthrob.      O-Town went on to sell over 5.6 million albums worldwide. However, the popularity of the group never approached the success of other bands in their genre. Once _Making the Band_ had finished its television run, O-Town floundered. The members signed numerous contracts, many that didn’t benefit them. Ashley, like other members of the band, was left without financial security, despite wide-spread media exposure. O-Town disbanded in 2003.      **Solo Work**   Angel is starred in a new MTV reality series _There and Back_, and produced his first solo album. The show chronicles his efforts to re-launch his career and support his new family. The theme song to the show is [Soundtrack To Your Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Ashley+Parker+Angel/_/Soundtrack+To+Your+Life), a song that was going to be on the new album. The song is being produced by The Matrix following the firing of Soul Power as producers. The lyrics are: “Your life is, a flashback, a question, a photograph, a statement, a story, a struggle, a chance to laugh. Cause if you don’t laugh, you cry, a last crescendo when you die, so hit the rewind and listen, to the playback, the soundtrack to your life.”. In 2004, Ashley signed a solo deal with Blackground/Universal Records. His debut album was released on May 16, 2006.      The first single [Let U Go](http://www.last.fm/music/Ashley+Parker+Angel/_/Let+U+Go) made the Billboard top 20. He is also opening for [Ashlee Simpson](http://www.last.fm/music/Ashlee+Simpson) during her June–July 2006 tour. Joining him on this tour is [Devin Bronson](http://www.last.fm/music/Devin+Bronson), who is best known for his guitar work with [Kelly Osbourne](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Osbourne) and [Avril Lavigne](http://www.last.fm/music/Avril+Lavigne). Devin is currently playing lead guitar for Angel.      **Solo Music**   His first single “Let U Go” debuted on MTV’s Total Request Live March 14, 2006, and on March 24 he reached #1. The single soon to be shipped to radio station outlets was his first as a solo artist and his first from the breakup of O-Town.
