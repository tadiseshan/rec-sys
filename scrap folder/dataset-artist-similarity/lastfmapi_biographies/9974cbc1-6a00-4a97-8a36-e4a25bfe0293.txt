**Eliane Elias** (b. 1960) is a Brazilian jazz composer, pianist, and singer.      Born on the 19th March 1960 in São Paulo, Brazil, Elias started learning to play the piano at the age of seven, and was transcribing solo portions of her parents’ jazz records by the age of twelve.      After studying for six years (and teaching by the age of fifteen) at Brazil’s prestigious Free Centre of Music Apprenticeship, she continued her classical education with [Amilton Godoy](http://www.last.fm/music/Amilton+Godoy) and Amaral Vieria. She was also the protégé of [Vinicius de Moraes](http://www.last.fm/music/Vinicius+de+Moraes), lyricist and songwriting partner of [Antonio Carlos Jobim](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Antonio+Carlos+Jobim), a huge influence on Elias’ work, and master of the Brazilian bossa nova movement. By the time she was seventeen years old she was touring with the best bossa nova composers and interpreters, composing her own pieces and performing at jazz clubs regularly.      Elias then moved to New York and studied privately with Olegna Fuschi at the Julliard School of Music, eventually joining jazz supergroup [Steps Ahead](http://www.last.fm/music/Steps+Ahead) (whose members included [Eddie Gomez](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddie+Gomez), [Michael Brecker](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Brecker), [Peter Erskine](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Erskine), and [Mike Mainieri](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Mainieri)).      Her first live instrumental recording, _Eliane Elias Plays Live_, was recorded in Amsterdam on the 31st May 2002, and digitally released in the USA in 2010.      Elias lives in New York City with her husband, bassist [Marc Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Johnson).      * [Official site](http://www.elianeelias.com)         The classical tradition meets the spontaneity of jazz through the virtuosic playing of Brazil-born and New York-based pianist Eliane Elias. A former member of jazz ensemble Steps Ahead, Elias has continued to explore two distinct musical streams through her solo recordings and her performances since the mid-’80s. In 1993, she became one of the few artists to release jazz and classical albums simultaneously. In a review of a concert in her homeland, Brazil magazine praised Elias for “her dazzling right-hand runs, executed often at frightening speeds. Her command of the keyboard was total. Her harmonic sensibility caused a sense of wonderment.”      Elias may have inherited at least some of her musical talents from her mother, Lucy, a classical pianist who often played jazz records in the family home. After studying for six years at the Free Center of Music Apprenticeship in São Paulo, she continued to study classical technique with Amilton Godoy and Amaral Vieira. By her teens, Elias was composing her own pieces and performing in jazz clubs. While touring in Europe in 1981, she met jazz bassist Eddie Gomez and was encouraged to travel to New York
