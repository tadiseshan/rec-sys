(2) Guitarist/singer/songwriter/producer/multi-instrumentalist Shuggie Otis may not be a household name, but his “Strawberry Letter 23” is in the record collections of millions of households. The Brothers Johnson’s cover of “Strawberry Letter 23” has sold over a million copies, peaking at number one R&B and number five pop on Billboard’s charts in summer 1977. It was on their LP Right on Time, which went platinum, selling over a million copies, holding the number one R&B spot for three weeks and making it to number 13 pop in spring 1977.

Born Johnny Otis, Jr. on November 30, 1953, in Los Angeles, CA, Otis’ formidable musical talents appeared at an early age. He began his professional career around 1965. He played a guitar solo on his bandleader, father Johnny Otis’ 1969 number 29 R&B hit, “Country Girl,” issued by Kent Records. His guitar skills were so adept that during his teen years, he would have to wear dark glasses and strategically apply black ink between his nose and mouth to appear old enough to perform in clubs with his father.      Signing with CBS Records, Otis began recording virtuoso guitar-laced R&B/West Coast blues sides. His first LP was Al Kooper Introduces Shuggie Otis on CBS. Johnny Otis produced 1970’s Here Comes Shuggie Otis, which was issued on the CBS imprint, Epic Records
