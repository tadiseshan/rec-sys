David Sanborn (born July 30, 1945) is an American saxophonist, most commonly associated with smooth [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) and [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop)-jazz fusion, along with a slight rock ‘n’ roll/[r and b](http://www.last.fm/tag/r%20and%20b) style. He was born in Tampa, Florida and grew up in Kirkwood, Missouri.      Sanborn, who suffered from polio in his youth, has been a highly regarded session player since the mid 1970s. One of his first professional gigs was as a member of [Paul Butterfield](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Butterfield)’s band. One of Sanborn’s earliest guest recordings was on [David Bowie](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie)’s _[Young Americans](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/Young+Americans)_. Around this time his output as a session player became prolific and over the next ten years he played with a dazzling array of artists, such as [Paul Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon), [James Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Taylor) (contributing to the remake of the [Marvin Gaye](http://www.last.fm/music/Marvin+Gaye) classic “[How Sweet It Is](http://www.last.fm/music/Marvin+Gaye/_/How+Sweet+It+Is)”), [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones), [The Eagles](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Eagles) and [Stevie Wonder](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder).      In the late 1980s he was a regular guest member of [Paul Shaffer](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Shaffer)’s band on Late Night with David Letterman. From 1988-89, he co-hosted a late-night TV music show on NBC with Jools Holland. The show, “Night Music”, following producer Hal Willner’s eclectic approach, drew Sanborn together with many famed musicians, such as [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis), [Lou Reed](http://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed), [Santana](http://www.last.fm/music/Santana), [Curtis Mayfield](http://www.last.fm/music/Curtis+Mayfield), and many others.      Throughout his career, Sanborn has skirted the edges of free jazz: In his youth he studied with [Roscoe Mitchell](http://www.last.fm/music/Roscoe+Mitchell) and [Julius Hemphill](http://www.last.fm/music/Julius+Hemphill), and performed on [Tim Berne](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Berne)’s _[Diminutive Mysteries](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Berne/Diminutive+Mysteries)_, dedicated to Hemphill. His 1991 album _[Another Hand](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Sanborn/Another+Hand)_, produced by [Hal Willner](http://www.last.fm/music/Hal+Willner), features [Charlie Haden](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Haden), [Jack DeJohnette](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+DeJohnette), [Bill Frisell](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Frisell), [Marc Ribot](http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Ribot), and various other players not usually associated with smooth jazz.
