Edwin McCain (born January 20, 1970 in Greenville, South Carolina) is an [alternative](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative) and [indie rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rock) guitar player. While his albums are released under his name, he does have a permanent band, referred to as the [Edwin McCain Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain+Band). Members of the band as of 2007 include [Larry Chaney](http://www.last.fm/music/Larry+Chaney), lead guitar; [Pete Riley](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Riley), rhythm guitar and background vocals; [Craig Shields](http://www.last.fm/music/Craig+Shields), saxophone and keyboards; Manny Yames, bass guitar; and [Peter Alexander](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Alexander), drums.      After signing a contract with the Atlantic Records label Lava Records in 1994, his first major-label album, [Honor Among Thieves](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain/Honor+Among+Thieves), was issued in 1995. His second album, [Misguided Roses](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain/Misguided+Roses), spawned [I’ll Be](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain/_/I%27ll+Be), a major single in 1998. Two more albums ([Messenger](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain/Messenger) and [Far From Over](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain/Far+From+Over)) followed, but at the end of 2001, he split from Lava. In 2003 he released a collection of acoustic versions of songs both old and new called [The Austin Sessions](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain/The+Austin+Sessions) via ATC Records, a Nashville-based independent record label (at which McCain was the first artist signed following its creation in 2001). Mid-2004 saw the arrival of his first studio album in three years, entitled [Scream & Whisper](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain/Scream+&+Whisper), which was released on another indie label, DRT Entertainment.      He has released two DVDs to date. The first was through ATC records in late 2002, called Mile Marker: Songs and Stories from the Acoustic Highway, and it consisted of interviews, live performances, and other material. The other was in late 2004, Tinsel & Tap Shoes. It was his first live concert DVD, recorded at The House of Blues in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.      A new CD was released in April, 2006 titled, [Lost In America](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain/Lost+In+America). Edwin recently signed a contract with Vanguard Records. This album (#8) is said to be a true “rock ‘n roll” collection.      Profile photo by ASHLittle.
