**Vincent Anthony “Vince” Guaraldi** (July 17, 1928 - February 6, 1976) was an Italian-American musician and composer. Primarily a pianist, known for his breezy and playful improvisational voicings, Guaraldi cultivated his own innovative brand of [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) music. As primary tunesmith for a number of animated adaptations of the comic strip _[Peanuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanuts)_, his influence on young potential jazz listeners was vast. Notably, his soundtrack album to the special of the same name, _[A Charlie Brown Christmas](http://www.last.fm/music/Vince+Guaraldi+Trio/A+Charlie+Brown+Christmas)_ (1965), is regarded as one of the greatest Christmas albums.      Born Vincent Anthony Dellaglio in San Francisco, the “city by the bay” would remain Guaraldi’s base of operations throughout his life, with Guaraldi eventually becoming a significant proponent of west coast jazz. Guaraldi’s first recorded work was as part of trio with [Cal Tjader](http://www.last.fm/music/Cal+Tjader) in 1953. By 1955, Guaraldi had formed [his own trio](http://www.last.fm/music/Vince+Guaraldi+Trio); in contrast to his later, more well-known work, his earlier music was decidedly morose and classically-inspired, as well as lacking drum accompaniment. Moreover, his actual compositional output was vastly outnumbered by cover versions.      Inspired by the 1959 film _Black Orpheus_, the trio recorded an album featuring renditions of songs from its soundtrack, as well as original compositions inspired by the film; one such original song, “[Cast Your Fate to the Wind](http://www.last.fm/music/Vince+Guaraldi+Trio/_/Cast+Your+Fate+to+the +Wind)”, became an award-winning best seller of its time, peaking at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100. Subsequent vocal versions (with lyrics by Carel Werber) also charted. “Cast Your Fate…” also ensured Guaraldi’s hiring as composer for a number of planned animated adaptations of the world-famous _Peanuts_ comic strip.      Guaraldi’s first composition for _Peanuts_ was “[Linus and Lucy](http://www.last.fm/music/Vince+Guaraldi+Trio/_/Linus+and+Lucy)”, a theme for the characters of Lucy and Linus van Pelt, which he first played over the phone to producer [Lee Mendelson](http://www.last.fm/music/Lee+Mendelson). Featured in the famous “dancing scene” from _A Charlie Brown Christmas_, it has been mistakenly assumed by many to be the “Peanuts Theme”, when in fact Guaraldi never composed such a theme; the specials tended to have their own individual themes. Regardless, it would become Guaraldi’s greatest-known work, being among the most recognizable pieces of music in the world.      _A Charlie Brown Christmas_, the first proper animated outing for the _Peanuts_ franchise, became an unexpected success upon its first airing, thanks in no small part to Guaraldi’s timeless score, mixing holiday standards with original tunes with Guaraldi’s laid-back, acoustic jazz style
