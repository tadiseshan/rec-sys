Emanuela Trane; also known as Dolcenera, was born in 1977 in Scorrano, in the Puglia region of southern Italy.      Armed with intelligent and emotional lyrics and an astonishing look, Dolcenera is one of Italy’s most talented musicians.      The translation of Dolcenera is “sweet and black” and these words describe her very well: profound and sexy, vulnerable and strong, rocking and affective, whilst being both an angel and a devil on stage.      She took part in the selection of the competition “Destinazione Sanremo” on the Rai 2 channel in 2002 and was invited to participate at the Sanremo Festival. She won in the category of “Young Section” in this very famous festival in 2003 with the track ‘Siamo Tutti Là Fuori’ and also won the Press, TV and Radio Award.      After this stunning success she started to present her first album “Sorriso Nucleare” and toured throughout Italy until 2004.      In 2005, after winning the famous Italian reality show “Music Farm”, she presented her second album “Un Mondo Perfetto” which remained in the charts for almost a year, a historical new entry for a young artist in 4th position.      In that year she composed and interpreted “Domani”, the hymn for the Championship of the National Juvenile Soccer. She won the coveted De Andrè Award and carried the Olympic Torch to the Marmi Stadium in Rome. She also received the Leone d’Argento in Venice as musical revelation of the year.      In 2006 Dolcenera was officially invited to participate in the Sanremo Festival. The title of the song was “Com’è Straordinaria La Vita”, the first single from her album “Il Popolo Dei Sogni”, which stayed in the Top 30 singles chart for many weeks.
