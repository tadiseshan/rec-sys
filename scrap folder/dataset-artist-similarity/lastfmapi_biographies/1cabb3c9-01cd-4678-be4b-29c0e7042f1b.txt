Yat-Kha, (a.k.a. [Albert Kuvezin and Yat- Kha](http://www.last.fm/music/Albert+Kuvezin+and+Yat-Kha), Russian: [Ят- Ха](http://www.last.fm/music/%D0%AF%D1%82-%D0%A5%D0%B0)) was founded in Moscow in 1991, as a collaborative project between [Albert Kuvezin](http://www.last.fm/music/Albert+Kuvezin) (russian: [Альберт Кувезин]( http://www.last.fm/music/%D0%90%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82+%D0%9A%D1% 83%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BD), formerly of [Huun-Huur- Tu](http://www.last.fm/music/Huun-Huur-Tu)) and Russian avant-garde, electronic composer [Ivan Sokolovsky](http://www.last.fm/music/Ivan+Sokolovsky). The project blended traditional [tuvan](http://www.last.fm/tag/tuvan) folk music with post-modern rhythms and electronic effects. Kuvezin and Sokolovsky toured and played festivals, and eventually took the name “Yat-Kha,” which refers to a type of small, Central Asian [zither](http://www.last.fm/tag/zither) similar to a Chinese Guzheng that Kuvezin plays in addition to the guitar. In 1993, they released a self-titled album on the General Records label.      After the release of Yat-Kha, Kuvezin and Sokolovsky parted creative ways and Kuvezin went on to release five other albums under the name Yat-Kha with other musicians (and less of an emphasis on electronics), beginning with Yenisei Punk in 1995, with [morin khuur](http://www.last.fm/tag/morin%20khuur) player Alexei Saaia (produced by Lu Edmonds). Sokolovsky issued a remastered version of the Yat-Kha album, with additional tracks, under the title Tundra’s Ghosts in 1996/97.      Since 2001, they have been performing a live soundtrack to Vsevolod Pudovkin’s 1928 silent film Storm over Asia. They may release a DVD of this version of the film with Reality Film.      In 2005 the band released the album “Re-covers”, featuring covers of tracks by [Joy Division](http://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Division), [Captain Beefheart](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Captain+Beefheart), [Motorhead](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Motorhead), [Santana](http://www.last.fm/music/Santana), [Kraftwerk](http://www.last.fm/music/Kraftwerk) and [Hank Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Hank+Williams).
