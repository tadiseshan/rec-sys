**Uncle Kracker** (born Matthew Shafer 9 November 1974 in Mount Clemens, Michigan) is an American rock and roll and country music musician.      He started out his career at a young age as a fledgling rapper. He met [Kid Rock](http://www.last.fm/music/Kid+Rock) in 1987, and Rock asked Kracker to become his DJ. Kracker did not know how to work the turntables, but he soon learned how to, and he became a long-term friend and colleague of Rock.      Kracker worked with Kid Rock until he became a solo artist in 2000.      The [My Hometown Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=24704) reports that Kracker recorded [Postcards From Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Uncle+Kracker/Postcards+From+Home) over seven weeks in early 2011. The album title was inspired by his hectic life on the road after his successful [Happy Hour](http://www.last.fm/music/Uncle+Kracker/Happy+Hour) longplayer.
