**Cypress Hill** is an American [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) group from South Gate, California. Cypress Hill was the first latino group to have platinum and multi-platinum albums and one of the first rap groups to gain a following with fans of [hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock) and [metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/metal). The band was originally called DVX, but the name was changed after Mellow Man Ace left in 1988.      Their first album, which was self-titled, was released in August 1991. Its single was “[Phuncky Feel One](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Cypress+Hill/_/Phuncky+Feel+One)”, but it was the B-side “[How I Could Just Kill a Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill/_/How+I+Could+Just+Kill+a+Man)” (formerly “Trigga Happy Nigga”) that attracted more airplay on urban radio and college radio. Based on the success of the single and other tracks such as bilingual track “[Latin Lingo](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill/_/Latin+Lingo)” and X-rated Spanish track “[Tres Equis](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill/_/Tres+Equis)”, the album sold two million copies in the US alone. Subsequently, DJ Muggs produced the first [House of Pain](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain) album, then worked on other projects like [Funkdoobiest](http://www.last.fm/music/Funkdoobiest). The band made their first appearance at Lollapalooza on the side stage in 1992.      Black Sunday, the group’s second album, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1993, recording the highest Soundscan for a rap group up until that time. Also with their debut still on the charts they became the first rap artists to have 2 albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 at the same time. With “Insane in the Brain” becoming a crossover hit, the album went triple platinum in the U.S. and sold about 3.25 million copies.      Cypress Hill was banned from Saturday Night Live after Muggs smoked cannabis on-air and the band trashed their instruments while playing their second single “I Ain’t Goin’ Out Like That”. The band headlined the “Soul Assassins” tour with House of Pain and Funkdoobiest as support, then performed on a college tour with Rage Against the Machine and Seven Year Bitch. In 1993, Cypress Hill also had two tracks on the Judgment Night soundtrack, teamed up with Pearl Jam and Sonic Youth.      The band played at the 1994 Woodstock Festival introducing their new member Eric Bobo, formerly a percussionist with the Beastie Boys. Bobo is the son of salsa musician Willie Bobo. Rolling Stone magazine named the band as the best rap group in their music awards voted by critics and readers. Cypress Hill played at Lollapalooza for two successive years, topping the bill in 1995. They appeared on the The Simpsons episode “Homerpalooza”.      Their third album Cypress Hill III: Temples of Boom was released in 1995 selling 1.5 million copies and reaching number 3 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the hit single “Throw Your Set in the Air”
