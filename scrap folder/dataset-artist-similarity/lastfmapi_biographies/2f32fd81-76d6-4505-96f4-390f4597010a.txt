Sara Groves (born in 1972) is an American singer/songwriter from Burnsville, Minnesota, near the Twin Cities.      Sara received her Bachelor of Science degree in History and English in 1994 from Evangel University, a private Christian university in Springfield, Missouri. Sara spent four years teaching high school in Rosemount, Minnesota before recording her first album, Past the Wishing, in 1998. Since then, she has released five more albums and appeared on several others (see below). Sara has been nominated for 3 Dove Awards including “New Artist of the Year” in 2002 and “Special Event Album of the Year 2003” by the Gospel Music Association. She was named one of the best Christian music artists of 2005 and the album, Add to the Beauty, was named “Album of the Year” for 2005 by CCM Magazine. In 2009 Fireflies & Songs earned enough votes from a panel of ten music critics to be named Christianity Today’s Album of the Year. The magazine explained their choice: “Already known for her transparent songwriting, Sara Groves gets even more piercingly honest on this, her ninth album. Whether her relationship with God, marital tension, or a private battle with anxiety, it’s poetically spilled forth in Groves’ call for the church to ‘live confessionally.’ And paired with less poppy, stripped-down arrangements, her achingly clear vocal remains front and center. This is vintage Groves—yet more herself than ever.”
