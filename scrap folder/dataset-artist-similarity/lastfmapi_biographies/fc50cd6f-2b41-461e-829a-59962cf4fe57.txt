**Leigh Bingham Nash** (born 27 June 1976) is a singer, and composer, best known as the lead vocalist for the rock band [Sixpence None the Richer](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer).      Nash was born Leigh Bingham in New Braunfels, Texas. She met guitarist and songwriter [Matt Slocum](http://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Slocum) at a church retreat in the early 1990s. The two formed **Sixpence None the Richer** soon after and went on to record six albums with the band. Their first album, released when she was just 16, was [The Fatherless and the Widow](http://www.l ast.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer/The+Fatherless+and+the+Widow). The album garnered critical acclaim and Slocum and Nash searched for new band members. They found Tess Wiley, Dale Baker, and J.J. Plascencio. The new band recorded [This Beautiful Mess](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer/This+Beautiful+Mess), which won a Dove Award for Best Album. Wiley quit the band after their US tour and the band signed to the Squint Records label. The band’s new self-titled album was released in 1997. A year later, the teen movie _She’s All That_ and the popular teen soap _Dawson’s Creek_ played [Kiss Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer/_/Kiss+Me) (with tie-in videos) which went on to be a hit single off the album and the band’s most recognizable song. In 1999 they received numerous Dove Awards, including Best Artist of the Year. The band was also nominated for a Grammy Award. After problems with their record labels, Sixpence came back in 2001 with the album [Divine Discontent](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer/Divine+D iscontent) after losing both Dale Baker and J.J. Plascencio. Two singles from that album, [Breathe Your Name](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer/_/Breathe+Your+Name) and [Don’t Dream It’s Over](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer/ _/Don%27t+Dream+It%27s+Over), went onto the charts. However, Sixpence announced their break-up on 26 February 2004 when Slocum sent a letter to CCM Magazine.      Nash married PFR drummer [Mark Nash](http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Nash) in the late 1990s, after the couple met while both bands were performing at the Cornerstone Festival in Illinois.      Leigh Nash has also done guest performances as the lead vocalist on several songs by [Delerium](http://www.last.fm/music/Delerium). [Innocente](http://www.last.fm/music/Delerium/_/Innocente) is probably the best known of these.      In the fall of 2005, Nash began work on her first solo album with producer [Pierre Marchand](http://www.last.fm/music/Pierre+Marchand). The album, titled [Blue On Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Leigh+Nash/Blue+On+Blue), was released on 15 August 2006 on her personal label, One Son Records. The first single, [My Idea of Heaven](http://www.last.fm/music/Leigh+Nash/_/My+Idea+of+Heaven), was released to USA radio the week of 14 July 2006.
