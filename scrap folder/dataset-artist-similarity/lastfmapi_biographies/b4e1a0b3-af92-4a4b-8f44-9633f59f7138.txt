**Devin the Dude** is a Houston-area rapper. Though relatively well-known among the [underground hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/underground%20hip-hop) community during the mid-to-late 90’s, **Devin** did not achieve [mainstream](http://www.last.fm/tag/mainstream) success until his appearance on [Dr. Dre](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre)’s [2001](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/2001) album. Besides sex, relationships, ridin’ trucks, smokin’ reefer, drinkin’ beer, partying, and conscious or proverbial themes, much of Devin’s work is also light-hearted and comically self-deprecating.      Copeland started out as a member of the Odd Squad, later known as the Coughee Brothaz, a group of rappers signed to Rap-A-Lot Records. The label is notable for being the home of hip-hop artists such as Geto Boys, Scarface, and Too Much Trouble. Copeland moved on to become part of Scarface’s Facemob, before going solo in 1998.[1] Copeland has released six solo albums: The Dude (1998), Just Tryin’ ta Live (2002), To tha X-Treme (2004), Waitin’ to Inhale (2007), Landing Gear (2008), and Gotta Be Me (2010). He also made a number of guest appearances, including on Dr. Dre’s “Fuck You” in 1999, and De La Soul’s “Baby Phat” in 2001.[1]      In 2008, he ended his 15 year relationship with Houston based Rap-A-Lot Records because the label failed to renew his contract.[2] Later that year, he signed with indie label Razor & Tie.[3]      Despite being a critical success, Devin the Dude has not achieved success in the mainstream but continues to be a well-known underground hip-hop artist. The New York Times has called him “A brilliant oddball with a spaced-out flow.”[4] In addition, he has been called “Rap’s best-kept secret” and “Your favorite rapper’s favorite rapper.”[5] In 2007, he appeared in a documentary titled Screwed In Houston produced by VBS/Vice Magazine that details the history of the Houston rap scene.
