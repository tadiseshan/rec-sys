   Earl Klugh (Born September 16, 1953 in Detroit, Michigan) is an American smooth jazz/jazz fusion guitarist and composer. Klugh finger picks a classical guitar with nylon strings.      At the age of 13, Klugh was captivated by the guitar playing of [Chet Atkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Chet+Atkins) when he made an appearance on the Perry Como Show. He has since been a guest on several Atkins albums. Atkins, reciprocating as well, joined Earl on his Magic In Your Eyes album. Klugh was also influenced by [Bob James](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+James), [Ray Parker Jr](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ray+Parker+Jr), [Wes Montgomery](http://www.last.fm/music/Wes+Montgomery) and [Laurindo Almeida](http://www.last.fm/music/Laurindo+Almeida). His sound is a blend of these [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz), [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) and rhythmâ€™ and blues influences, forming a potpourri of sweet contemporary music original to only him.      Klugh became a guitar instructor at the young age of 15, and was eventually discovered by Yusef Lateef. His career rapidly progressed to working with the likes of [George Benson](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Benson), [George Shearing](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Shearing), [Chick Corea](http://www.last.fm/music/Chick+Corea), and many others. Like several other Detroit-bred entertainers, Klugh attended Mumford High School (Michigan).      For their album One on One, Klugh and Bob James received a Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance of 1981. He has since received 13 Grammy nods, millions of record and CD sales, and continues touring worldwide to this day.
