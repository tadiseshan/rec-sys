**Rolf Harris**, CBE, AM (born 30 March 1930), is an Australian/British musician, singer, composer, painter, and television host and personality.      **Biography**      Named after Rolf Boldrewood, an Australian writer his mother admired, he was born in Bassendean, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, Australia, to Cromwell (“Crom”) Harris and Agnes Margaret Harris (née Robbins) who had both emigrated from Cardiff, Wales. He is the nephew of Australian artist Pixie O’Harris, (1903-1991), i.e. Rhona Olive Pratt, née Harris.      As an adolescent and young adult, Harris was a champion swimmer being the Australian Junior 110 yards Backstroke Champion in 1946 and Western Australian state champion over a variety of distances and strokes during the period 1948–1952. Harris attended Perth Modern School in Subiaco, and the University of Western Australia. He met his wife, the Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes, while they were both art students, and they married on 1 March 1958. They have one daughter, Bindi Harris (born 10 March 1964), who studied art at Bristol Polytechnic and is now a painter.      **Music and art**      Harris moved to England as an art student at City and Guilds Art School, Kennington, South London at the age of 22, getting into television with the BBC in 1953, doing a regular ten minute cartoon drawing section with a puppet called ‘Fuzz’, made and operated on the show by magician Robert Harbin. He illustrated Robert Harbin’s Paper Magic (1956). He also had a few acting roles in British television programs and film as Harry in The Vise and as Pvt. Proudfoot in the 1955 Tommy Trinder film ‘You Lucky People’. When Commercial television started in 1956, Harris was the only entertainer to work on both BBC and ITV, performing on BBC with his own creation, ‘Willoughby’, a specially made board on which he drew Willoughby, (voiced and operated by Peter Hawkins) . The character would then come to life and hold a comedy dialogue with Harris as he drew cartoons of Willoughby’s antics. On Associated Rediffusion he invented a character called Oliver Polip the Octopus which he drew on the back of his his hand and animated, as well as illustrating Oliver’s adventures with cartoons on huge sheets of card. He had drifted away from art school as a slightly disillusioned student and had luckily met his long time hero, Australian impressionist painter Hayward Veal, who took Harris under his wing and became his mentor, teaching him the rudiments of impressionism and showing him how it could help with his portrait painting. At the same time, Harris was entertaining with his piano accordion every Thursday night at a club called the Down Under, a haunt for homesick Australians and New Zealanders. Here, over the next several years, he honed his entertainment skills, eventually writing the song which was later to become his theme song, ‘Tie me kangaroo down sport’
