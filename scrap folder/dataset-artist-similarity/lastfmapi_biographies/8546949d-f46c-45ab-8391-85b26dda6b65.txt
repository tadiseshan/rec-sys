**Timothy Charles Buckley III** (February 14, 1947 â€“ June 29, 1975) was an [experimental](http://www.last.fm/tag/experimental) vocalist and performer who incorporated [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz), [psychedelia](http://www.last.fm/tag/psychedelia), [funk](http://www.last.fm/tag/funk), [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul), and [avant-garde](http://www.last.fm/tag/avant-garde) [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock), in a short career spanning the late 1960s and early 1970s, ending with his death at age 28 from an alcohol-heroin overdose.      Buckley often regarded his tenor voice as an instrument, a talent most noticeable on his albums _[Happy Sad](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Buckley/Happy+Sad)_, _[Lorca](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Buckley/Lorca)_, and _[Starsailor](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Buckley/Starsailor)_. His first marriage was to Mary Guibert, with whom he had a child, musician [Jeff Buckley](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley). They divorced in 1968 and after this Buckley would meet with his son only once more. Buckley married second wife Judy Brejot Sutcliffe in 1970 and adopted her son, Taylor.      Born in Washington DC, Buckley,an Irish-American, lived for 10 years in Amsterdam, New York, before moving to southern California, initially to Bell Gardens and later settling in Anaheim in 1965. His experiences with music were through his family, artists such as [Billie Holiday](http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday), [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra) and [Judy Garland](http://www.last.fm/music/Judy+Garland) being particular favorites in the household. During his childhood, Buckley was a fan of [Johnny Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash), [Hank Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Hank+Williams), [Nat King Cole](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole) and [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis), although [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) music was his foremost passion. Reflecting this, at the age of 11 Buckley learned how to play the banjo, an instrument which his mother had bought to occupy him following a bout of mumps. He attended Loara High School in Anaheim, California, and, amongst others, made friends with Don Gordon, Larry Beckett, Jim Fielder (original member of [Blood, Sweat & Tears](http://www.last.fm/music/Blood,+Sweat+&+Tears)) and future wife, Mary Guibert. He was an accomplished high school athlete, becoming a quarterback for the school team in addition to getting a place on the baseball team. During this period playing as quarterback, Buckley broke the first two fingers on his left hand but they never fully returned to normal and made guitar playing more difficult. At the age of 15, Buckley abandoned the banjo and moved on to the guitar, playing with Princess Ramona & The Cherokee Riders, a country and [western](http://www.last.fm/tag/western) band
