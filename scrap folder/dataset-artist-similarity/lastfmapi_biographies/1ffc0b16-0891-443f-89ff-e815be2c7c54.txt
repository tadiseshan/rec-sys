**Tammar Anika Chin** (born June 14, 1983), popularly known as **Tami Chynn**, is a [singer](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer), [songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/songwriter) and [dancer](http://www.last.fm/tag/dancer) from Kingston, Jamaica. Her mother is of half Jamaican and half British ancestry while her father is of Chinese descent and Cherokee ancestry. Tami is also the older sister of [reggae fusion](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae%20fusion) artist [Tessanne Chin](http://www.last.fm/music/Tessanne+Chin).      Tami Chynn grew up in the parish of St. Andrew, Jamaica where she attended St. Peter and Paul Prep school and later Campion College. In 1998, at age 14, she moved to London, England where she spent three years studying the performing arts and in 2001, at age 17, moved back to Jamaica where she worked on her music career and recorded her first single “Rock U” for which she made her first music video. Along Tami Chynn’s career climb, she has appeared on recordings with International Reggae stars [Sean Paul](http://www.last.fm/music/Sean+Paul), [Beenie Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Beenie+Man), [Elan](http://www.last.fm/music/Elan), [Assassin](http://www.last.fm/music/Assassin) and [Lady Saw](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Saw). In addition, she has collaborated with and appeared in music videos with reggae/dancehall artist [Wayne Marshall](http://www.last.fm/music/Wayne+Marshall), whom she married in September 2009. Prior to pursuing singing professionally, she toured with [Shaggy](http://www.last.fm/music/Shaggy) as a backup dancer.      Although knee deep in the [dancehall](http://www.last.fm/tag/dancehall) and [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae) scene, there is something different and distinct about Tami’s style of music. Her style is simply “[eclectic dancehall](http://www.last.fm/tag/eclectic%20dancehall),” as she calls it, which combines Pop, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Dancehall and Reggae. Her diverse influences have always given her a more worldly sound. Looking to artists such as [Madonna](http://www.last.fm/music/Madonna), [Gwen Stefani](http://www.last.fm/music/Gwen+Stefani) and [Kylie Minogue](http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue), Tami Chynn has always understood the importance of being an artist who’s able to reinvent herself in new genres.      In early 2005, Tami travelled to Los Angeles, USA to perform for Universal Mowtown Records and in May she was signed to the label. In 2006, Tami released her first US single [Hyperventilating](http://www.last.fm/music/Tami+Chynn/_/Hyperventilating), which became a hit among Internet fans. In Summer 2006 her first album, **Out of Many…One**, was independently released in Japan where it managed to peak at #41 on the Japanese Oricon Charts and featured hits like [1,2,3,4](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Tami+Chynn/_/1,2,3,4) and [Looky Looky](http://www.last.fm/music/Tami+Chynn/_/Looky+Looky) . Tami continued recording songs for the Jamaican [dancehall](http://www.last
