As a young working musician in London, England in the 1970s, Laurence Juber got an extraordinary, life-changing break when Paul McCartney picked him to become Wings’ lead guitarist. Juber spent three years recording and touring with the band. During that time he won a Best Rock Instrumental GRAMMY® for the track “Rockestra” from the Wings album Back To The Egg.      After Wings disbanded in 1981, Juber embarked on a career as a solo artist, composer and arranger, and soon developed a reputation as a world-class guitar virtuoso, being voted #1 by Fingerstyle Guitar magazine. He has released 12 critically acclaimed solo albums, including “LJ Plays the Beatles”, “Guitarist” and “One Wing”. His latest release “I’ve Got The World On 6 Strings”, is a collection of solo guitar arrangements of tunes by Harold Arlen, composer of ‘Over The Rainbow’, and ‘Stormy Weather’ among many other classics.      Juber’s DVD “Guitar Noir” is ‘DVD Etc.’ magazine’s top pick for surround-sound 5.1 audio and earned a 2005 CEA “Demmy” award for sonic excellence. His solo guitar arrangement of “The Pink Panther Theme” is featured on the Best Pop Instrumental GRAMMY®-winning album “Henry Mancini-Pink Guitar”.      Folios and DVDs of his compositions and arrangements are published by Alfred Publications and Hal Leonard. The venerable C.F. Martin Company currently offers an ‘LJ’ Signature model guitar and GHS Strings market Juber’s Signature guitar strings.
