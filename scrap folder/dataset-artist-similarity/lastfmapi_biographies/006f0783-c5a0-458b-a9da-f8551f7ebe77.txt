Richard Hawley (born Richard Willis Hawley, 17 January 1967, Sheffield, United Kingdom) is a critically-acclaimed guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer. Hawley initially found success as a member of Britpop band [Longpigs](http://www.last.fm/music/Longpigs) in the 1990’s, and formerly [Treebound Story](http://www.last.fm/music/Treebound+Story). When a drug- filled torpor after an extensive tour of America brought the band to the brink of extinction in 1997, Hawley was asked to play with [Pulp](http://www.last.fm/music/Pulp) by his close friend and Pulp frontman [Jarvis Cocker](http://www.last.fm/music/Jarvis+Cocker). “They saved my life,” Hawley later recalled, “I was going mental with drink and drugs.” The subsequent world tour in support of Pulp’s album _[This Is Hardcore](http://www.last.fm/music/Pulp/This+Is+Hardcore)_ left Hawley emotionally and physically drained on his return to his home city. During this time, he even considered leaving the music industry altogether.      It was an encounter at Hawley’s Sheffield home that led the longtime collaborator out of the shadows. Impressed by a home demo of his songs, both Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey urged Hawley to head into the studio and begin work on his first solo release. 2000’s [eponymous mini album](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Hawley/Richard+Hawley) encouraged Hawley to return to the studio once more. In 2001 _[Late Night Final](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Hawley/Late+Night+Final)_, named after the cry of vendors selling the Sheffield Star evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press, if unspectacular sales. Two years later Hawley released _[Lowedges](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Hawley/Lowedges)_, another Sheffield reference, this time to the curiously named suburb of the city that had so entranced the young Hawley when he had seen it on the destination board of a bus. NME called _[Lowedges](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Hawley/Lowedges)_ the “first great album of 2003” and it topped an end of year poll held by Virgin Radio.      In 2004 Hawley signed to [Mute Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Mute+Records), a division of the giant [EMI](http://www.last.fm/label/EMI). Legal wrangling delayed _[Cole’s Corner](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Hawley/Cole%27s+Corner)_, Hawley’s fourth release, until September 2005. Again Hawley mines the theme of his beloved home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. _[Cole’s Corner](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Hawley/Cole%27s+Corner)_ eventually gained a nomination for the acclaimed Mercury Prize in 2006.      Hawley’s work as a session musician and producer remains in high demand. After contributing towards her [eponymous 2004 release](http://www.last.fm/music/Nancy+Sinatra/Nancy+Sinatra), Hawley also supported [Nancy Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Nancy+Sinatra) on her European tour in 2005
