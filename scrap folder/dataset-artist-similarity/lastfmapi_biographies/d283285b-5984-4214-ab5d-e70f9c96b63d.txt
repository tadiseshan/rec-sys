Freestyle Fellowship is a rap group from Los Angeles consisting of rappers [Aceyalone](http://www.last.fm/music/Aceyalone), [Myka 9](http://www.last.fm/music/Myka+9), [P.E.A.C.E.](http://www.last.fm/music/P.E.A.C.E.), [Self Jupiter](http://www.last.fm/music/Self+Jupiter) and producer J Sumbi. Their vocal techniques focusing on the method of the freestyle, as well as a successful infusion of hip hop and jazz established the group as forerunners in the sub-genre of jazz rap, also placing them amongst prominent West coast underground rap acts of the early 1990s like [Hieroglyphics](http://www.last.fm/music/Hieroglyphics), [Abstract Rude & Tribe Unique](http://www.last.fm/music/Abstract+Rude+&+Tribe+Unique), and [The Pharcyde](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pharcyde).      Freestyle Fellowship was formed at the Good Life Café in LA during the early to mid 90s. Originally they were just a group of friends that met up at the Good Life’s open mic sessions. The original Freestyle Fellowship consisted of over 50 members. The Emcees known as Freestyle Fellowship were the members that consistently came to the most open mic sessions.      Officially forming in 1991 and releasing the underground track To Whom It May Concern, the Fellowship became known in tape-trading circles, identified by their range in rhyming, at times bordering on scat, and Afrocentric messages over jazz inspired beat production. Their 1993 release, Innercity Griots is acknowledged by many to be among the most influential albums in the history of real hip hop.[citation needed]Aceyalone, the most prolific artist of the group in terms of solo album releases, is known for such works as All Balls Don’t Bounce and Love and Hate, a cooperative album with producer [RJD2](http://www.last.fm/music/RJD2). Mikah 9, P.E.A.C.E. and Self Jupiter also had solo releases, affirming the group’s position as showcase for the varied and individual talents of the individual MC. Each member continues a part time commitment to the original group, most recently making a 2005 appearance on a compilation for Los Angeles based label Project Blowed, with the track “Outro”.
