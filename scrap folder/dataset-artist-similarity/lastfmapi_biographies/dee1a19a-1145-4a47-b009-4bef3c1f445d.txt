Michel Sardou (born January 26, 1947) is a French singer.      He was born in Paris, the son of Fernand Sardou and Jackie Rollin (Jackie Sardou). Contrary to what has been written at the beginning of his career, he is not the grandson of the dramatist Victorien Sardou.      He is known for songs dealing with various social and political issues, such as the rights of women in Islamic countries, clerical celibacy and colonialism. Another sometimes controversial theme found in some of his songs (“Les Ricains,” for example) is respect and support for the culture and foreign policies of the United States. Another notable fact about his career is that he has focused his full attention on his homeland, ignoring the prospect of an international audience, although his 1981 single “Les lacs du Connemara” did manage to become a big international hit. A number of his hit songs were written in collaboration with Jacques Revaux, a few others (most notably “En chantant”) with Italian singer [Toto Cutugno](http://www.last.fm/music/Toto+Cutugno).      Even in the 21st century, Michel Sardou remains immensely popular in France, selling out 18 consecutive dates at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in 2001, while his 2004 album “Du plaisir” went straight to the no. 1 spot on the French album charts.      He has been married three times, first to a French dancer, then to Babette (the mother of his children) and lastly to an lifelong friend who edits the French version of Vogue.
