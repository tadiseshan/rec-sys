[Give Me Your Eyes](http://www.last.fm/music/Brandon+Heath/_/Give+Me+Your+Eyes) was one of the most successful Christian songs of 2008 and its success continued into 2009. The tune won the Song of the Year and Best Pop/Contemporary Recorded Song at the 2009 Dove Awards. It spent 14 weeks at #1 on Billboard’s Hot Christian AC radio chart, and 27 weeks at the summit of the iTunes Christian Song Chart. Speaking with [Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=15482) about the song in a 2011 interview Heath said he never foresaw the song’s success: “I remember the day that we wrote it, and I had a good feeling about it,” he said, “Sometimes when you write, you think, yeah, I can see this working at radio, or I can see this really sticking in people’s heads. But the fact that there were sermons written after it, people went on missions trips. And as far as I know, I think it’s the first song in the history of my record label to go gold, as far as a single. That’s way, way beyond my expectations for that song. But it’s been great.”
