Dan Ar Braz, born Daniel Le Bras (15 January 1949, Quimper, Brittany), is a French (Breton) guitarist and the founder of [Dan Ar Braz et l’Héritage des Celtes](http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Ar+Braz+et+l%27H%C3%A9ritage+des+Celtes). He collaborated with the famous breton harpist [Alan Stivell](http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Stivell) at his debut.      In 1972 he formed his own group called [Mor](http://www.last.fm/music/Mor). Compared to Stivell’s group, this was middle-of-the-road (MOR) and broke up shortly after recording one album. Ar Braz followed this with a solo album of Irish jigs and reels but this was not commercially successful. In 1976 he relocated to England and joined [Fairport Convention](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairport+Convention) for a while.      In 1992 the organiser of the Festival de Cornouaille in Quimper asked him to create a live show uniting traditional music with modern styles. Ar Braz had many contacts in Britain, France and America and delivered beyond all expectations. [Dónal Lunny](http://www.last.fm/music/D%C3%B3nal+Lunny) came from Ireland, [Karen Matheson](http://www.last.fm/music/Karen+Matheson) from Scotland, [Elaine Morgan](http://www.last.fm/music/Elaine+Morgan) from Wales and Bagad Kemper (bagpipers) and also [Alan Stivell](http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Stivell) from Brittany. Altogether 75 musicians were involved. The group, called “L’Héritage des Celtes” performed at the Quimper festival in July 1993 then went on to Rennes in 1994. A hugely successful studio recording recreated the show. It sold 100,000 copies in over ten countries.      Following this, Ar Braz returned to solo work.
