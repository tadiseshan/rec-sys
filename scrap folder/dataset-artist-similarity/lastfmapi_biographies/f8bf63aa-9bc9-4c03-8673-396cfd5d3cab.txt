Juliana Hatfield (born July 27, 1967 in Wiscasset, Maine, United States), is an American guitarist/singer-songwriter from the Boston area, formerly of the indie rock band Blake Babies.      The daughter of Philip M. Hatfield (a radiologist) and The Boston Globe fashion critic Julie Hatfield, Juliana was born in Maine and grew up in the Boston suburb of Duxbury. She acquired a love of rock music during the 1970s, having been introduced by a babysitter to the music of the seminal Los Angeles punk rock band [X](http://www.last.fm/music/X), which proved a life-changing experience. She was also attracted to the music of more mainstream artists like [Olivia Newton-John](http://www.last.fm/music/Olivia+Newton-John) and [The Police](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Police), perhaps explaining the dialectic in her later music between sweet, melodic “pop” songs and more hard rock oriented material. Visualizing herself as a singer since her high school years, Hatfield sang in school choirs and briefly played in a cover band called The Squids, which played [Queen](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen) and [Rush](http://www.last.fm/music/Rush) songs.      Hatfield began her solo career following the [Blake Babies](http://www.last.fm/music/Blake+Babies)’ breakup in 1991, releasing her first solo album [Hey Babe](http://www.last.fm/music/Juliana+Hatfield/Hey+Babe) in 1992. The album was one of the highest selling independent albums of 1992. Hatfield recruited a rhythm section comprised of former [Moving Targets](http://www.last.fm/music/Moving+Targets) and [Bullet Lavolta](http://www.last.fm/music/Bullet+Lavolta) drummer [Todd Phillips](http://www.last.fm/music/Todd+Phillips), and Thudpucker bassist Dean Fisher, and thus becoming [The Juliana Hatfield Three](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Juliana+Hatfield+Three).      Hatfield achieved alterna-rock stardom with the release of 1993’s [Become What You Are](http://www.last.fm/music/Juliana+Hatfield/Become+What+You+Are) (recorded under the group name The Juliana Hatfield Three). Several songs from the album received regular airplay on major North American rock stations, with Hatfield’s song “My Sister” becoming the biggest hit of her career with the video becoming an MTV staple. Another one of her songs (“Spin the Bottle”) was used in the soundtrack of the Hollywood film Reality Bites (1994). Hatfield also made the cover of Spin magazine. Hatfield’s popularity coincided with the success, in the mid-1990s, of many other female musicians (such as [Liz Phair](http://www.last.fm/music/Liz+Phair), [PJ Harvey](http://www.last.fm/music/PJ+Harvey), [Belly](http://www.last.fm/music/Belly), [Letters to Cleo](http://www.last.fm/music/Letters+to+Cleo), [Velocity Girl](http://www.last.fm/music/Velocity+Girl), [The Breeders](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Breeders), [Hole](http://www.last.fm/music/Hole), [Veruca Salt](http://www.last.fm/music/Veruca+Salt), [Poe](http://www.last.fm/music/Poe), [Throwing Muses](http://www.last
