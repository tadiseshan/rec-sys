**Eddy Grant** (b. 1948) is a Guyanan musician.      Born Edmond Montague Grant on the 5th March 1948 in Plaisance, Guyana, he emigrated with parents to London, England when he was still young. As a teenager he formed the multi-racial group [The Equals](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Equals). He sported dyed blonde hair, and had his first million-selling number-one hit in 1968, when he was the lead guitarist and main songwriter with his song “[Baby Come Back](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Equals/_/Baby+Come+Back)”. Grant openly used his songwriting for political purposes, as in “[Police on My Back](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Equals/_/Police+on+My+Back)”, and later “[Gimme Hope Jo’anna](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+Grant/_/Gimme+Hope+Jo%27anna)” about the then-current apartheid regime of South Africa.      By the early 1980s Grant released _[Killer on the Rampage](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+Grant/Killer+on+the+Rampage)_, using MTV exposure to have big hits in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia with the ’80s techno reggae of “[Electric Avenue](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+Grant/_/Electric+Avenue)”, and following that up with the title song for the successful 1984 film _Romancing the Stone_. The album _[Walking On Sunshine](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+Grant/Walking+On+Sunshine)_ produced the popular tracks “[I Don’t Wanna Dance](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+Grant/_/I+Don%27t+Wanna+Dance)” and “[Gimme Hope Jo’anna](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+Grant/_/Gimme+Hope+Jo%27anna)”.
