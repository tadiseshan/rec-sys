Mark Lavon Helm (May 26, 1940-April 19, 2012), better known as Levon Helm, was an American rock musician most famous as the drummer for the rock group [The Band](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band). Helm was also known for his deeply soulful, country-style voice, and powerful drumming style highlighted on many of the The Band’s recordings, such as “[The Weight](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band/_/The+Weight)”, “[Up On Cripple Creek](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band/_/Up+On+Cripple+Creek)”, “[King Harvest](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band/_/King+Harvest)”, “[Ophelia](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band/_/Ophelia)” and “[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band/_/The+Night+They+Drove +Old+Dixie+Down)”.      **Early years**   Helm was born in Marvell, Arkansas and began playing the guitar at the age of eight. Helm also played drums during his formative years and established his first band The Jungle Bush Beaters while in high school. He was influenced by the Grand Ole Opry and by R&B songs that he heard on radio station WLAC out of Nashville, Tennessee.      Helm became interested in rock and roll after attending an [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley) concert. He moved from Arkansas to Memphis, Tennessee where he was influenced by [Bo Diddley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bo+Diddley) and [Conway Twitty](http://www.last.fm/music/Conway+Twitty). At age 17 he was invited to join The Hawks, backing rockabilly singer [Ronnie Hawkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Ronnie+Hawkins). Soon after Helm joined The Hawks, they moved to Toronto where, in 1959, they signed with Roulette Records and released several singles, including a few hits.      In the early 1960s Helm and Hawkins recruited an all-Canadian lineup of musicians: guitarist [Robbie Robertson](http://www.last.fm/music/Robbie+Robertson), bassist [Rick Danko](http://www.last.fm/music/Rick+Danko), pianist [Richard Manuel](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Manuel) and organist [Garth Hudson](http://www.last.fm/music/Garth+Hudson). In 1963, the band parted ways with Hawkins and started touring under the name Levon and The Hawks and later to the Canadian Squires before finally changing back to The Hawks. They recorded two singles, but found little success.      **The Band**   By the mid 1960s, [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan) was interested in performing electric rock music, and asked The Hawks to be his backing band. Disheartened by fans’ negative response to Dylan’s new sound, Helm returned to Arkansas for what turned out to be a two-year layoff, being replaced by Mickey Jones. During his absence, The Hawks had taken up residence in Woodstock, New York and began writing their own songs; Danko and Manuel also shared writing credits with Dylan on a few songs. Here they recorded a large volume of demo tapes, many with fellow Woodstock resident Dylan (who had completely withdrawn from public life the previous year)
