**Masta Ace** (born Duval Clear) is a rapper from Brooklyn, New York. Appearing on the classic 1988 posse cut, [The Symphony](http://www.last.fm/music/Marley+Marl/_/The+Symphony), he garnered notoriety as an unsung asset to the [Juice Crew](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Crew) posse, and is therefore, widely considered one on the roster, where he released a number of well-respected albums that were nonetheless little-heard outside purist circles. The single that has earned him the most attention has been [Jeep Ass Niguh](http://www.last.fm/music/Masta+Ace/_/Jeep+Ass+Niguh) (alternatively known as “Born To Roll”, essentially a remix which uses the track from Def Jam artist Original Concept’s “Knowledge Me”).      His most recent (and reportedly final) solo album, [A Long Hot Summer](http://www.last.fm/music/Masta+Ace/A+Long+Hot+Summer), gained considerable acclaim in 2004. He is currently in the [hip hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip%20hop) group [eMC](http://www.last.fm/music/eMC), with [Punchline](http://www.last.fm/music/Punchline), [Wordsworth](http://www.last.fm/music/Wordsworth) and [Stricklin](http://www.last.fm/music/Stricklin). They have a page at <http://www.myspace.com/emcthegroup>.      In the early stages of his career, Masta Ace was very energetic (cf. “Jeep Ass Niguh”, where, tongue-in-cheek, he taunts police officers for their knee-jerk predisposition to harass black youth on city streets.) He also recorded material with a six-member supporting entourage, **Masta Ace Incorporated**. In light of his newly claimed status as a veteran, he has gravitated toward an earnest, matter-of-fact plainspokenness in the new millennium. Many of the songs that have lent newfound heft to his reputation are simple, no-nonsense rumination on feelings and facts of [urban](http://www.last.fm/tag/urban) [American](http://www.last.fm/tag/american) life, including “Soda and Soap”, “Brooklyn Masala” (which highlights a budding romance between Ace and a lovely but reserved Pakistani Hindu immigrant), and “Beautiful”.      **1988-1994**   Ace made his recording debut as **Master Ace** on the [classic](http://www.last.fm/tag/classic) [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag /hip-hop) posse-cut “The Symphony”, along with fellow Juice Crew members [Craig G](http://www.last.fm/music/Craig+G), [Kool G Rap](http://www.last.fm/music/Kool+G+Rap), and [Big Daddy Kane](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Daddy+Kane), released on [Marley Marl](http://www.last.fm/music/Marley+Marl)’s [In Control](http://www.last.fm/music/Marley+Marl/In+Control) album. _In Control_ also featured two lesser known Ace tracks “Keep Your Eyes on the Prize” and “Simon Says”. His first solo single, “Together” b/w “Letter to the Better”, was released in 1989. He released his debut album, [Take a Look Around](http://www.last.fm/music/Masta+Ace/Take+a+Look+Around), through Marl’s Cold Chillin’ label in 1990, featuring production from Marl and [DJ Mister Cee](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Mister+Cee)
