Keyboardist/singer/songwriter/arranger/musical director Patrice Rushen has had an outstanding career with several Top Ten R&B hits, including “[Haven’t You Heard](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/_/Haven%27t+You+Heard),” “[Forget Me Nots](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/_/Forget+Me+Nots),” “[Feels So Real](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/_/Feels+So+Real),” and “[Watch Out](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/_/Watch+Out).” Arguably she has received much of her popularity through other acts copying or sampling her material. “Forget Me Nots” was the basis of [Will Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Smith)’s “[Men in Black](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Smith/_/Men+in+Black)” from the blockbuster movie of the same name on [Big Willie Style](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Smith/Big+Willie+Style) and [George Michael](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Michael) extensively used the same track for his hit ‘[Fastlove](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Michael/_/Fastlove)’. [R. Kelly](http://www.last.fm/music/R.+Kelly)’s “[Remind Me](http://www.last.fm/music/R.+Kelly/_/Remind+Me)” was sampled from her “[You Remind Me](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Patrice+Rushen/_/You+Remind+Me),” a popular radio-aired LP track from [Straight From The Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/Straight+From+The+Heart). Others who have sampled Rushen’s music include [Def Jeff](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Def+Jeff) (Rushen’s “[Hang It Up](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/_/Hang+It+Up)”) [Zhane](http://www.last.fm/music/Zhane) (“Groove Thang”) and a dance act called [Daddy’s Favourite](http://www.last.fm/music/Daddy%27s+Favourite) who remade ‘Haven’t you heard’ into a track called “[I Feel Good Things for You](h ttp://www.last.fm/music/Daddy%27s+Favourite/_/I+Feel+Good+Things+for+You)”.      Born September 30,1954, in Los Angeles, CA, Rushen’s parents enrolled her in music classes at U.S.C. when she was three. In her teens, she won a solo competition at the 1972 Monterey Jazz Festival. The attention garnered from this earned her a contract with [Prestige Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Prestige+Records). After recording three albums and becoming an in-demand session player, Rushen signed with [Elektra Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Elektra+Records) in 1978. Forging an engaging jazz/R&B/funk fusion, she regularly hit the R&B charts. Her five albums for the label were [Patrice](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/Patrice), [Pizzazz](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/Pizzazz), [Posh](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/Posh), [Straight From The Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/Straight+From+The+Heart), and [Now](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen/Now). Some of these sides can be found on Haven’t You Heard:The Best of Patrice Rushen.      In 1993, Rushen signed with Disney’s [Hollywood Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Hollywood+Records)
