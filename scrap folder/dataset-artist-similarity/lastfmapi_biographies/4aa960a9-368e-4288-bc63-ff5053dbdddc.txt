Jeffree Star (born Jeffrey Lynn Steininger, November 15, 1985), is an American model, fashion designer, make-up artist, DJ, and singer-songwriter residing in the Los Angeles area. He is a pop star known for his outrageous makeup and tattoos as well as his fashion line and from his transgressive, genderfuck and gender-bending appearance and persona while calling himself “Queen of the Beautifuls”. Star has leveraged his fame as an androgynous model and aesthetic talents to launch his own clothing line and forays into acting and DJing.      Star was born in Orange County, California. His father died in his childhood thus Star was left alone while his working model mother went on assignments. He began experimenting with his mother’s makeup at a young age, leading to an obsessive compulsive interest, and convinced his mom to let him wear make-up to school when he was in junior high.      **Plastic Surgery Slumber Party 2006-2007**   Star’s music career as an electronica and hip-hop vocalist began when he befriended Peaches’ drummer who encouraged him to make music. Star was then asked by Hollywood Undead to rap on their song “Turn off the Lights” for their debut album. However, the track did not make it onto the disc.      His first two solo tracks “We Want Cunt”, named in tribute to his former screen name Cunt: Queen of the Beautifuls, and “Straight Boys” were co-written with Hole and one time Mötley Crüe drummer, Samantha Maloney and singer Jessicka from Scarling. Star asked MySpace co-founder Tom to convert his MySpace profile into a music page so he could showcase his music.      On November 1, 2006 Star performed on the same bill as Los Angeles’ Dirty Sanchez at the LA bar Key Club’s post-Halloween show. Star has toured with electro musician Peaches, as well as Cyndi Lauper, Metro Station, Breathe Carolina, Dr. Manhattan, Schoolyard Heroes, and Ultraviolet Sound.      On the 13 March, 2007, Star released his debut extended play Plastic Surgery Slumber Party which was produced by Ultraviolet Sound. The record topped at number one on the iTunes’s dance charts and “has consistently topped the iTunes dance charts at #1, hovering high above household names such as Justin Timberlake and Cascada.” Separately, Star’s MySpace page has 25 million listens to Plastic Surgery Slumber Party as of July 2007.      During the summer of 2007, Star was advertised as a part of the True Colors Tour 2007,which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada.The tour, sponsored by the LGBT Logo channel, began on June 8, 2007 to coincide with Pride month. Profits from the tour benefited the Human Rights Campaign as well as PFLAG and The Matthew Shepard Foundation.
