      Tha Eastsidaz is a rap group made up of Snoop Dogg, Tray Deee, & Goldie Loc. The Group was formed in 1999. They were signed on to Snoop’s Doggystyle Records, and they released their debut album Snoop Dogg Presents Tha Eastsidaz. The album was a hit and eventually went platinum. They were also featured on Lay Low, a hit single off of Snoop Dogg’s Last Meal album. Next year they released their second album, Duces ‘N Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way. The album was critically good, but was certified gold unlike their first album, which went platinum. The group broke up when Snoop left while making their second album and when Tray Deee was sentenced to 12 years in prison for attempted murder. In 2005, Goldie Loc and Snoop Dogg reunited to form Tha Eastsidaz. They released a new joint album with the IV Life Family. Goldie Loc is also involved in The Warzone Snoop Dogg’s new project.
