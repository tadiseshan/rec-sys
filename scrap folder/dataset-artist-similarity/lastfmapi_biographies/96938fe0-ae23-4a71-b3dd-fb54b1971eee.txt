Diego Antonio Caccia Torres (born March 9, 1971 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is an Argentine pop singer and composer. He launched his first album, “Diego Torres”, produced by Cachorro López. This album was rewarded 3 times platinum.      Two years later, and a little distant from TV, he launched his second album called “Tratar de estar mejor” which received 5 platinum albums in Argentina and gold and platinum albums in other Latin American countries. This album launched Torres to the international scene.      In 1996, the Italian producer Ceso Valli produced Torres’ third album, “Luna Nueva”, and months later Diego started touring with his band all across Latin America, United States, and Spain. The album went on sale, soon becoming gold and quickly being rewarded with the platinum in Argentina.      In 1999, he recorded his fourth album called “Tal Cual Es”, produced by Cachorro López. This album showed Diego’s talent and creativity to compose and mix different Latin sounds, such as flamenco guitars as well as various other tropical sounds.      His next album was named “Un Mundo Diferente” which was recorded in the second half of 2001 in Buenos Aires and Miami. This album presents an interesting variety of styles and merges with a delicate harmony of several Latin rhythm styles.      2004 brought a new challenge to Diego: the possibility of recording an MTV Unplugged, which would be aired in the MTV networks of Brazil, Latin America, Spain and United States. The reconversion of the acoustical in some of his hits along with the presentation of his new themes are part of this show, which is also produced on CD and DVD.      Torres’ newest album, “Andando” has been released in all parts of the world.
