Tony MacAlpine (born August 29, 1960 in Springfield, Massachusetts) is a guitar and keyboard virtuoso who came on to the neo classical/shred scene in the mid 80s. He later experimented with [jazz rock fusion](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20rock%20fusion) and combined it with his classical training, as can be heard on [Chromaticity](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+MacAlpine/Chromaticity) (2001). He has released many solo albums in his career. Some of his other projects include [CAB](http://www.last.fm/music/CAB), [Planet X](http://www.last.fm/music/Planet+X), [Steve Vai](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Vai) and [Ring of Fire](http://www.last.fm/music/Ring+of+Fire).
