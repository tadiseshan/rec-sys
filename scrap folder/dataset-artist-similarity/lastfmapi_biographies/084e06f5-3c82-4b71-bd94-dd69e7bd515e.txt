Christopher E. Martin (born March 21, 1966), better known as DJ Premier (or Primo by his fans, fellow musicians, and critics), is a prominent American hip hop producer and DJ, and the instrumental half of the duos [Gang Starr](http://www.last.fm/music/Gang+Starr) and [PRhyme](http://www.last.fm/music/PRhyme).      Contrary to popular belief, he did not found nor even co-found Gang Starr.      He was introduced to DJing while attending school at Prairie View A&M in Houston, Texas. DJ Premier’s original stage name was Waxmaster C, the “C” taken from his first name, Chris, although he had already changed it to DJ Premier at the time he joined Gang Starr.      Considered by many fans to be one of the greatest hip hop producers, DJ Premier has produced countless tracks, for many groups and solo artists since the early 1990s. These include notable tracks for artists such as Jay-Z (“D’Evils”, “So Ghetto”), Big L (“The Enemy”), The Notorious B.I.G. (“Unbelievable”, “Kick In The Door”, “Ten Crack Commandments”), Nas (“N.Y. State of Mind”, “Nas Is Like”), Pitch Black (“It’s All Real”), M.O.P. (“Downtown Swinga”), Jeru the Damaja (“Come Clean”, “My Mind Spray”), KRS-One (“MC’s Act Like They Don’t Know”), Mos Def (“Mathematics”), Non Phixion (“Rockstars”), and Royce da 5’9” (“Boom”).(Full list: djpremiertrackology.8kilo.com)      Collaborations      Outside of Gang Starr, some of Premier’s most lauded work is his collaborations with Jeru the Damaja and Group Home. With the former, Premier crafted one of the East Coast’s landmark albums in the form of The Sun Rises in the East, released in 1994. Their follow up to this, 1996’s Wrath of the Math, was regarded as a solid effort but not on par with its predecessor, although it did contain Jeru’s biggest hit to date, “Ya Playin’ Yaself”. Group Home’s Livin’ Proof (1995), although greatly overlooked at the time of its release, has eventually come to be critically acclaimed.      In 1994, DJ Premier collaborated extensively with jazz musician Branford Marsalis’s experimental group, Buckshot Lefonque, for their debut album. During the making of music video director, Hype Williams’ 1998 film, Belly, DJ Premier collaborated with neo soul leader D’Angelo for a song called “Devil’s Pie”, which was originally intended only for the film’s accompanying soundtrack. However D’Angelo soon changed his mind and decided to include the song on his sophomore album Voodoo (2000) In 2006 he co-produced Christina Aguilera’s Back To Basics album.         Samples      DJ Premier’s style of production epitomises the New York sound from his earlier peers. He is known for sampling jazz, funk, and soul artists, as well as sampling an artist’s past work, when he is creating a new track for that same artist. In addition, his photographic memory of rap lyrics allows him to distinctively “speak with his hands” by scratching in lyrics from several different songs to construct new phrases [1]
