**[Phil Collins](http://www.philcollins.co.uk)** (Philip David Charles Collins LVO, born 30 January 1951 in Chiswick, London) is an English [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), drummer, keyboardist and actor best known as a drummer and vocalist for the English [progressive rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20rock) group [Genesis](http://www.last.fm/music/Genesis) and as well as being a Grammy and Academy Award-winning solo artist.      Collins sang the lead vocals on eight American chart-toppers between 1984 and 1989, seven of those as a solo artist and one with Genesis. His singles, often dealing with lost love, have ranged from the atmospheric “[In the Air Tonight](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Collins/_/In+the+Air+Tonight)” to the [dance pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/dance%20pop) of “[Sussudio](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Collins/_/Sussudio)” to the political statements of his most successful song “[Another Day in Paradise](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Collins/_/Another+Day+in+Paradise)”. His latest (and possibly his last) album, the [cover](http://www.last.fm/tag/cover) album ‘_[Going Back](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Collins/Going+Back)_’ that came out in 2010, particularly shows the massive influence of [60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s) American [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) music on Collins’ career. His international popularity transformed Genesis from a cult favourite rock group to a regular on the pop charts and an early MTV mainstay. According to [britishhitsongwriters.com](http://britishhitsongwriters.com), he is the forty-eighth most successful songwriter in U.K. singles chart history based on weeks that his compositions have spent on the chart.      Collins’ professional career began as a drummer, starting first with the obscure [space rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/space%20rock) group [Flaming Youth](http://www.last.fm/music/Flaming+Youth). Then, working with the avant- garde band Genesis, Collins originally supplied backing vocals for frontman [Peter Gabriel](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel) and provided drumming that was a key part of their sound. Collins sung lead on only two songs: “[For Absent Friends](http://www.last.fm/music/Genesis/_/For+Absent+Friends)” from 1971’s ‘_Nursery Cryme_’ album and “[More Fool Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Genesis/_/More+Fool+Me)” from ‘_Selling England by the Pound_’, which was released in 1973. Upon Gabriel’s departure in 1975, Collins became the group’s lead singer after much soul-searching in the band’s line-up. While keeping a similar [art rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/art%20rock) and [progressive](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive) music based sound for several years, the band evolved into more of a melodic [pop rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop%20rock) direction. As the decade closed, Genesis’ first international hit, “[Follow You, Follow Me](http://www.last
