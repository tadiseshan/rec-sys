Jedi Mind Tricks (JMT) is a hip hop group formed in 1996 with two members from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and one from Camden, New Jersey. The group was founded by two high school friends rapper Vinnie Paz (Vincenzo Luvineri) and producer / DJ Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind (Kevin Baldwin). In 1999 the New Jersey rapper Jus Allah (James Bostick) joined the group to record the 2nd studio album by JMT, Violent by Design but left shortly after for reasons that remain unexplained. The track “The Rebuilding” (2006) marked his unofficial return to JMT since the split, but made a full fledged return aside Vinnie Paz for the 6th studio album, A History of Violence (2008).      DJ Kwestion is also a part of the group, mainly scratching choruses on the turntable. Kwestion (or Kwes) is also a part of the group Skratch Makaniks. Kwestion was a replacement for JMT’s previous tour DJ, Drew Dollars, who is no longer affiliated with the group.      JMT has collaborations with both regional MCs and rap veterans, including GZA, Kool G Rap, 7L & Esoteric, Sean Price, Ras Kass, Canibus, Percee P, Killah Priest, Louis Logic, R.A. the Rugged Man, Tragedy Khadafi, and Ill Bill. The group has sold 250,000 albums in the United States and 300,000 albums worldwide, all of which were released independently.      **History         Amber Probe EP and Psycho-Social LP**      JMT officially debuted with the Amber Probe EP in 1996. The B-side of that EP was also included in their first LP, The Psycho-Social LP, which was released a year later. On this album Vinnie Paz called himself “Ikon the Verbal Hologram”.      The Psycho-Social LP was a concept album containing themes of conspiracy theories and ancient Middle-Eastern mythology. It also featured the recording debut of fellow Philadelphia rap-group Lost Children of Babylon and Connecticut’s Apathy on multiple songs. However, the Lost Children of Babylon soon parted ways with JMT, and in a 2001 interview member Cosmic Crusader cited that while Vinnie Paz had assured them that his cause was all for spiritual hip hop, he soon saw “that Vinnie Paz was not really spiritual at all, but only interested in tapping that fan base.” In a later interview, member Rasul Allah stated that the group and JMT are on good terms.      **Five Perfect Exertions EP and Violent By Design**      Prior to the release of their first LP, Vinnie Paz had conceived the idea of forming a rotating, collaborative super-group of underground East Coast artists called the Army of the Pharaohs (AotP). 1998 saw the first result of these efforts in The Five Perfect Exertions EP. The release featured Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, Chief Kamachi and Bahamadia as well as Vinnie Paz himself. The EP was later remixed for JMT’s next LP, Violent by Design (2000), albeit without Chief Kamachi’s verse.   The LP, originally titled Nyugha Reincarnation of the Hologramic Christ, became seen as the group’s best work
