Frank Duval (born November 22, 1940, Berlin) is a German composer, conductor, producer, songwriter and singer.      He is someone who has never allowed commercialism to clip his wings, and who has always, for over 30 years, continued to open new musical frontiers.      Still searching, hungry, and outside conventional pathways, Frank Duval has long since escaped from the “golden cage” of show-business, and is again heading towards new artistic experiences.      Duval is the composer and virtuoso of sounds, who catered for “international highlights” with his albums, and has “often been copied”, has remained settled, but musically, he remains out of reach. He has written a section of German television and pop-music history, which is, as yet, open ended, as we shall still hear from him and see him.      Born into an artists’ family, he studied as an actor and dancer, but also sang with his sister, Maria. By the ’60s, Duval was also composing music, both orchestral and pop, and his debut soundtrack, for an episode of the German serial Tatort, aired in 1977. From his 1979 debut “Die Schönsten Melodien Aus Derrick und der Alte”, “Todesengel” became a moderate hit.      During the ’80s, Frank Duval released several soundtracks, as well as proper artist albums (with occasional lyrical help from his wife, Kalina Maloyer). He hit the German charts several times, with 1983’s “Ways,” 1986’s “Lovers Will Survive,” and 1987’s “When You Were Mine”.      In addition, he wrote songs for the following artists: Ivan Rebroff, Alexandra, Karin Huebner, Margot Werner, Klaus Löwitsch and Maria Schell.
