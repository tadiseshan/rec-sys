**[Robin Trower](http://www.last.fm/music/Robin+Trower)** (born March 9, 1945 in Catford, England) is a [british](http://www.last.fm/tag/british) [blues rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock) [guitarist](http://www.last.fm/tag/guitarist) who achieved success with [Procol Harum](http://www.last.fm/music/Procol+Harum) during the 1960’s, and then again as the leader of his own power trio.      Perhaps Trower’s most famous album is [Bridge Of Sighs](http://www.last.fm/music/Robin+Trower/Bridge+Of+Sighs) (1974). This album, along with his first ([Twice Removed From Yesterday](http://www.last.fm /music/Robin+Trower/Twice+Removed+From+Yesterday)) and third ([For Earth Below](http://www.last.fm/music/Robin+Trower/For+Earth+Below)) solo albums, was produced by his former Procol Harum band mate, organist [Matthew Fisher](http://www.last.fm/music/Matthew+Fisher).      Those who favor electric guitarists who can play live what they record in the studio will be very impressed with the “[Robin Trower Live](http://www.last.fm/music/Robin+Trower/Robin+Trower+Live)” album - especially the cut “[Daydream](http://www.last.fm/music/Robin+Trower/_/Daydream)”. While often compared to Jimi Hendrix, Robin Trower never received the publicity nor same volume of fans.
