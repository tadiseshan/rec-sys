**Bryan Ferry** (born 26 September 1945 in Washington, Tyne and Wear, England) is a British [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) and musician. Famed for his suave visual and vocal style, he came to public prominence in the [70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s) as the lead singer of the [art rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/art%20rock) group [Roxy Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music). After influencing many later bands with his crooning vocals and fashion sense, he has had a highly successful solo career upon leaving the group in 1984.      Ferry formed Roxy Music with a group of friends and acquaintances, beginning with musician Graham Simpson, in November 1970. The line-up expanded to include saxophonist/oboist [Andy Mackay](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Mackay) and his acquaintance [Brian Eno](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno), who owned tape recorders and played Mackay’s synthesizer. Ferry’s background in art school, influenced by boundary-pushing work as such as the pop art of [Andy Warhol](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Warhol) and the music of the [Velvet Underground](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Velvet+Underground), gave him a vision of mutated rock featuring electronic experimentation as well as lyrical cynicism.      The success of Roxy Music’s first album, 1972’s ‘_[Roxy Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music/Roxy+Music)_’, and first single, “[Virginia Plain](http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music/_/Virginia+Plain)”, contributed to the rise of an almost social movement like cultural following known as ‘Roxymania’. Many artists playing [art rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/art%20rock) and [glam rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/glam%20rock) music looked up to Ferry’s group, with the [new romantic](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20romantic) scene advanced by bands such as [ABC](http://www.last.fm/music/ABC) and [Duran Duran](http://www.last.fm/music/Duran+Duran) particularly aping their fashion sense. Several British punks, oddly enough, also looked to Roxy Music for their shared sense of musical experimentation with transgressive lyrics; the [Sex Pistols](http://www.last.fm/music/Sex+Pistols) is an interesting example.      Leaving Roxy Music in 1984 after the release of its swan song, ‘_[Avalon](http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music/Avalon)_’, Ferry’s solo work picked up right where his band went off. Playing a [smooth](http://www.last.fm/tag/smooth) brand of avant-garde pop layered with romance in his releases, his first post-Roxy album, 1985’s ‘_[Boys And Girls](http://www.last.fm/music/Bryan+Ferry/Boys+And+Girls)_’ proved an international hit. The album’s two top 40 singles, “[Don’t Stop the Dance](http://www.last.fm/music/Bryan+Ferry/_/Don%27t+Stop+the+Dance)” and “[Slave to Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Bryan+Ferry/_/Slave+to+Love)”, have been fan-favorites to this day.      While his career has waxed and waned over the decades, Ferry continues to tour
