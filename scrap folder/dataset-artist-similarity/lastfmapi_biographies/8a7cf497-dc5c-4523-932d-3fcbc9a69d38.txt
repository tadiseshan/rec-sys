Billy Preston (9 September 1946 - 6 June 2006) was an American [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) and [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), famously known as a child prodigy pianist before releasing several [rnb](http://www.last.fm/tag/rnb) hits (including #1 smashes “[Will it Go ‘Round in Circles](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Billy+Preston/_/Will+i t+Go+%27Round+in+Circles)” and “[Nothing From Nothing](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Preston/_/Nothing+From+Nothing)”) and working with classic artists such as [Aretha Franklin](http://www.last.fm/music/Aretha+Franklin) and [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles). He notably performed with [Mahalia Jackson](http://www.last.fm/music/Mahalia+Jackson) at the age of 16 and appeared as a young W.C. Handy in a 1958 biopic. His first solo record was a [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel) album called ‘16 Year Old Soul’.      Preston first came to widespread attention of a U.S. mainstream audience as the organist (and sometimes vocalist) in the house band on the television show ‘Shindig,’ popular during 1964-66. On tour backing stars [Little Richard](http://www.last.fm/music/Little+Richard) and [Sam Cooke](http://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Cooke), he met the Beatles (early in their career) in Hamburg, Germany in 1962. He was later invited by [George Harrison](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison) to join [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles) in the studio for the filming/recording of ‘_[Let It Be](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Let+It+Be)_’ (1970). Preston’s most memorable performance with the Beatles is on the track “[Get Back](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Get+Back)”.      The apparent reason for the collaboration was that the project was being done live— without overdubs— and the Beatles wanted a second keyboardist. Preston’s soulful style was to compliment the [rhythm and blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/rhythm%20and%20blues) approach the Beatles had for this album. His was a genre they’d grown up listening to and were reaching back to as well as paying tribute to.      Another apparent reason for Preston’s involvement was to buffer the growing tensions between the members of the band (that had started around the time of filming). Everyone set aside their differences to make Preston feel welcome at the sessions. Members of the band have later commented on their joy with working with Preston, whom they respected as a talented musician.      While Preston was never considered for permanent membership in the Beatles (despite stories to the contrary), he did continue working with them through to the end of the [60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s): releasing two solo albums on Apple Records (the Beatles’ label), collaborating with George Harrison on ‘_[All Things Must Pass](http://www.last
