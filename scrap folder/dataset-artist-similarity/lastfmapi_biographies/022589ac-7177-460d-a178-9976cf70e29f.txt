Freddie Mercury (September 5, 1946 – November 24, 1991) was a rock musician, best known as the frontman and lead singer for the English rock band [Queen](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen). He is remembered for his powerful vocal abilities and charisma as a live performer. As a songwriter, he composed many international hits, including [Killer Queen](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Killer+Queen), [Bohemian Rhapsody](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Bohemian+Rhapsody), [Somebody to Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Somebody+to+Love), [We Are the Champions](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/We+Are+the+Champions), [Bicycle Race](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Bicycle+Race), [Don’t Stop Me Now](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Don%27t+Stop+Me+Now), and [Crazy Little Thing Called Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Crazy+Little+Thing+Called+Love). Mercury died from complications of AIDS, greatly increasing public awareness of the disease.      Freddie Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara in Stone Town on the African island of Unguja (the largest island of the Zanzibar archipelago - at the time a British colony, now part of Tanzania). His parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, were Indian Parsis, descendents of 10th century Persian Zoroastrians immigrants in India. The family had emigrated to Zanzibar in order for Bomi to continue his job as a middle-ranking cashier at the British Colonial Office. Mercury had one younger sister, Kashmira.      Mercury was sent back to India to attend St. Peter’s boarding school near Bombay (now Mumbai). It was at St. Peter’s where he learned to play the piano and joined his first band, The Hectics. He stayed in India for most of his childhood, living with his grandmother and aunt. Mercury completed his education in India at St. Mary’s High School in Mazagon before returning to Zanzibar. He was 17 when he and his family finally fled to England, as a result of the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution. In England, he earned a Diploma in Art and Graphic Design at Ealing Art College, following in the footsteps of Pete Townshend. He later used these skills in order to design the Queen crest.      Widely considered as one of the greatest vocalists in popular music, Freddie Mercury possessed a very distinctive voice. Although his speaking voice naturally fell in the baritone range, his singing voice was that of a tenor. His recorded vocal range spanned nearly four octaves (falsetto included), with his lowest recorded note being the F below the bass clef and his highest recorded note being the D that lies nearly four octaves above. In addition to vocal range, Mercury often delivered technically difficult songs in a powerful manner. However, due in part to the fact that he suffered from vocal nodules (for which he declined surgery), he would often lower the highest notes during many concerts. Mercury also claimed that he never had any formal vocal training.      As a songwriter, Mercury wrote ten out of the seventeen songs on [Queen](http://www
