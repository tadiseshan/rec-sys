Eek-a-Mouse (born Ripton Hylton November 19, 1957 in Kingston, Jamaica) is one of Jamaica’s premier reggae stars. He is responsible for the creation of the reggae sub-genre singjaying. Although now in his 50s, he is still reputed to perform more than 200 shows in a year in America and the West Indies.      Born in Kingston, Jamaica as Ripton Hylton, Eek-a-Mouse began his foray into reggae music when he was in college, but did not begin to garner a substantial audience until 1979 with his hit “Once a Virgin”. This same year, he changed his singing name to “Eek-a-Mouse”, the name of the racehorse he always bet on. In 1981, he cheered up the Reggae Sunsplash Festival, which was still mourning over the death of reggae icon Bob Marley. After this, his fame continued increasing through the year 1982 until 1988, when he released “Eek-A-Nomics”, his last full-length CD until 1996.      Eek-a-Mouse is a regular at the Jamaican music festival Reggae Sunsplash and often teams up with reggae duo Michigan and Smiley. He has also been featured on Christian rock group P.O.D.’s (Payable on Death) album Satellite, lending his vocals to the rock-reggae track “Ridiculous”.
