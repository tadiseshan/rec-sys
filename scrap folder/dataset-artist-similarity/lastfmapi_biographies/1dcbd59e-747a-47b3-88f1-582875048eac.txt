Billy Nicholls is a British singer-songwriter. His psychedelic pop album album “Would You Believe?” was conceived as a British response to the Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds”. Financial problems prevented the album from being released after it was recorded in the 1960s, but since then it has developed a cult following as a lost pop classic.
