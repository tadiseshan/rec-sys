Timothy Elpadaro Thedford, better known by his fans as Jay Electronica, is an American rapper born on September 19, 1976. He originates from from the Magnolia Projects in New Orleans, Louisiana. He produced the first track, “Queens Get the Money”, on the 2008 [Nas](http://www.last.fm/music/Nas) album ‘Untitled’. The unconventional nature of much of his music, and the lack of conventional release methods for that music, has since 2007 made him the object of much attention. He was perhaps best known for the piece of music Act 1: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge), until the release of the [Just Blaze](http://www.last.fm/music/Just+Blaze)-produced track “Exhibit C” in late 2009. Announced Friday, November 12, 2010, Jay is an official member of [Jay-Z](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay-Z)’s Roc Nation.      Jay Electronica has yet to release a full-length album but has released two official singles to date, “Exhibit A” and “Exhibit C,” which won a Sucker Free Summit Award for Instant Classic. His music so far has been made available through the internet, either through being leaked to what URB magazine describes as “obscure web forums”, or through an appearing and disappearing MySpace page (currently two seem to be in existence, at /jayelect and at /jayelectronica). [Erykah Badu](http://www.last.fm/music/Erykah+Badu) has questioned whether he ever will release, in her words, “actual albums”. From New Orleans, LA he has lived in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Denver, and Detroit, where he recorded his Style Wars-era music with several [J Dilla](http://www.last.fm/music/J+Dilla) beats, meeting the producer subsequently to ask for permission to use the recordings as a demo. Detroit is where Electronica met producer/engineer Mike “Chav” Chavarria, who introduced him to both [J Dilla](http://www.last.fm/music/J+Dilla) and Mr. Porter, and who is now a regular collaborator.      Jay Electronica first gained significant attention through Act 1: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge), made available on a MySpace page in 2007. It is 9:13 continuous minutes of music, without drums, built from Jon Brion’s soundtrack to the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There are five segments or movements, marked by changes in music and mood, raps by Electronica, and occasional snippets of sampled dialogue (children arguing in Kurdish, Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka). The first segment is spoken word by [Just Blaze](http://www.last.fm/music/Just+Blaze) and [Erykah Badu](http://www.last.fm/music/Erykah+Badu) describing the artist over piano music. The nature of the piece of music, along with the nature of its appearance, led to a slow build-up of interest in Electronica as an enigmatic figure. Songs circulating online as the Style Wars EP gained wider circulation, and other songs, such as the dream-inspired “Dimethyltryptamine”, soon appeared. In January 2008, [Gilles Peterson](http://www.last.fm/music/Gilles+Peterson)’s 90-minute [Gilles Peterson](http://www.last
