In a world full of manufactured over-hyped pop music, Aynsley Lister is proof that there is light at the end of the tunnel. When all that seems to matter to record company executives is looks, the fact that Lister writes and performs all of his own material seems such a waste. The fact that he has the looks as well is just irrelevant. Witnessing him live on stage, what you see is what you get. Powerful, infectious songs performed with the kind of conviction of someone twice his age.      Here he is performing at Ripley Blues Club   <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N6-oyPrdXk>
