**Rosemary Clooney** (born 23 May 1928 in Maysville, Kentucky, USA – 29 June 2002) was an American singer and actress.      Clooney’s first recordings, in May 1946, were for [Columbia Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Columbia+Records). She sang with Tony Pastor’s big band. Clooney continued working with the Pastor band until 1949, making her last recording with the band in May of that year and her first as a solo artist a month later, still for Columbia.      She came to prominence in the early 1950s with the novelty hit [Come On-a My House](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosemary+Clooney/_/Come+On-a+My+House) written by William Saroyan and his cousin Ross Bagdasarian (better known as David Seville, the father figure of Alvin and the Chipmunks), which was followed by other pop numbers such as “Botch-a-Me” (a cover version of the Italian song Ba-Ba-Baciami Piccina by Alberto Rabagliati), “Mambo Italiano”, “Tenderly”, “Half as Much”, “Hey There” and “This Ole House”, although she had success as a jazz vocalist. Clooney’s career languished in the 1960s, partly due to problems related to depression and drug addiction, but revived in 1977, when her White Christmas co-star [Bing Crosby](http://www.last.fm/music/Bing+Crosby) asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She continued recording until her death in 2002. She was the aunt of Academy Award winning actor [George Clooney](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Clooney); mother-in-law of singer [Debby Boone](http://www.last.fm/music/Debby+Boone); and sister to former television personality Nick Clooney. She was the ex-wife of [Jose Ferrer](http://www.last.fm/music/Jose+Ferrer); mother of actor Miguel Ferrer      Clooney was diagnosed with lung cancer at the end of 2001.
