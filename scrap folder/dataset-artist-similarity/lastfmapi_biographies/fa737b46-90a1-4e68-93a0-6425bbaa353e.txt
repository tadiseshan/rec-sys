Tony Christie (AKA Anthony Fitzgerald), has had an illustrious career spanning over 40 years.      Born 1943, Yorkshire, UK, Christie started his musical life in 1960 in a duo called the [Grant Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Grant+Brothers), and until 1969 he simply fronted bands. In 1969 he signed up with [MCA Records](http://www.last.fm/label/MCA+Records). Hits such as [Amarillo](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Christie/_/Amarillo) and [I Did What I Did For Maria](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Christie/_/I+Did+What+I+Did+For+Maria) followed.      Christie sold over 10 million records in the 70s. The 80s saw a slowdown due to changing musical taste, however he was awarded Die Golden Europa by German radio for superb showmanship.   The 90s led to more hits such as the song [Sweet September](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Christie/_/Sweet+September) and the [Jarvis Cocker](http://www.last.fm/music/Jarvis+Cocker) song [Walk like a panther](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Christie/_/Walk+like+a+panther).      Peter Kay brought Christie to a whole new generation of youth with the song [Is This The Way To) Amarillo](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Christie/_/Is+Thi s+The+Way+To\)+Amarillo) and [Avenues And Alleyways](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Christie/_/Avenues+And+Alleyways).
