Imogen Heap (born December 9, 1977, in Havering, Outer London) is a British [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) / [electronica](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronica) artist. She is known for her work as part of the musical duo [Frou Frou](http://www.last.fm/music/Frou+Frou) from 2002-3, and for her solo albums, which she writes, produces, and mixes. She has released a series of solo albums including Ellipse (in 2009), a North American chart success that earned Heap two Grammy nominations and won her the Best Engineered Album (Non- Classical) award.      Heap grew up playing music from an early age, and by her eleventh birthday she was writing her own songs. From the age of 15, she studied at the BRIT School Of Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon, South London, recording three tracks for the school’s annual CD between 1994 and 1995, “Aliens” being the title track of the latter.      After being introduced to [Nik Kershaw](http://www.last.fm/music/Nik+Kershaw) by his manager Mickey Modern, Heap and Kershaw recorded four demos that Mickey Modern took to Rondor Music. Consequently, a few months later Heap signed her first record contract at 18 to independent record label Almo Sounds. During 1996, Heap began working with an experimental pop band called [Acacia](http://www.last.fm/music/Acacia), which featured her future collaborator [Guy Sigsworth](http://www.last.fm/music/Guy+Sigsworth) and was fronted by the singer [Alexander Nilere](http://www.last.fm/music/Alexander+Nilere). While never a full member of the band, Heap was a guest vocalist (as a counterpart to Nilere) and contributed to various Acacia single and album tracks in 1997. One Acacia song, “Maddening Shroud”, would later be covered by [Frou Frou](http://www.last.fm/music/Frou+Frou).      Heap enjoyed a prestigious live début, performing four songs (backed by friends [Acacia](http://www.last.fm/music/Acacia)) between sets by [The Who](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who) and [Eric Clapton](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton) at the 1996 Prince’s Trust Concert in Hyde Park, London. Her début album, [I Megaphone](http://www.last.fm/music/Imogen+Heap/I+Megaphone) (an anagram of “Imogen Heap”) was internationally released in 1998 on independent record label [Almo Sounds](http://www.last.fm/label/Almo+Sounds) and garnered critical acclaim. However, as production of the album neared completion, it was announced that the record label had been sold and would be shut down. I-Megaphone featured collaborations with [Guy Sigsworth](http://www.last.fm/music/Guy+Sigsworth) and [Dave Stewart](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Stewart). In [Japan](http://www.last.fm/place/Japan), the regional distributor, Zora, re- released the album in 2002, featuring “[Blanket](http://www.last.fm/music/Urban+Species/_/Blanket),” her collaboration with [Urban Species](http://www.last.fm/music/Urban+Species) which was released as a single in the [United Kingdom](http://www.last
