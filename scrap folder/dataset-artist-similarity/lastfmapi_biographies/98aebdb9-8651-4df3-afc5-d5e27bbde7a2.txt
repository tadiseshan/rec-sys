Matt Molloy (born 12 January 1947, Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon) is a renowned Irish flautist and traditional musician. A master of the Sligo tradition of flute and tin whistle playing, Molloy has played a vital role in the evolution of Irish music. During the 1970s, Molloy was a member of [The Bothy Band](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bothy+Band) and its successor, the re-founded [Planxty](http://www.last.fm/music/Planxty). He joined [The Chieftains](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chieftains) in 1979, succeeding [Michael Tubridy](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Tubridy). Over the course of his career, Molloy has worked with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, [Paul Brady](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Brady), [Tommy Peoples](http://www.last.fm/music/Tommy+Peoples), [Micheál Ó Súilleabháin](htt p://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Miche%C3%A1l+%C3%93+S%C3%BAilleabh%C3%A1in) and [Dónal Lunny](http://www.last.fm/music/D%C3%B3nal+Lunny).      As charter member of the Bothy Band, Molloy brought a modern sensibility to Ireland’s traditional music. In addition to recording four memorable solo albums, Molloy has applied the warm, airy tones of his flutes to the music of Paul Brady, Tommy Peoples, Michael O’Suillabhain, Dónal Lunny, Planxty, and the Irish Chamber Orchestra. Malloy has been one of two non-Dubliners in the Chieftains since 1979.      A native of the small County Roscommon village of Ballaghadereen, Molloy represents the third generation of flute players in his family. Starting to learn the instrument at the age of eight, he won the All-Ireland Flute Championship nine years later. An invitation to join the National Fleadh Cheoil And Oirechta followed shortly afterwards. Moving to Dublin in the early ’70s, Molloy quickly established himself as one of the city’s leading traditional musicians. When his busy schedule allows, Molloy can be found at the pub that he owns in Westport, County Mayo.
