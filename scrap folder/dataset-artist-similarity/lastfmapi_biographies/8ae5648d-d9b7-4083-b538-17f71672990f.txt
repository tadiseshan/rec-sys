Born on the 6 October 1968 in Provins, [France](http://www.last.fm/place/France), Dominique Ané is the only child of a teacher and a homemaker. A loner throughout his teenage years, he was passionate about literature and music from a young age. He was interested in punk but, at the age of 14, at the beginning of the 1980s, he started to appreciate the dark romanticism of the New Wave movement. After completing high school he studied humanities for a year while holding a range of odd jobs, including a spell as a utility man for an FM radio station in Nantes, where his family lived. At around the age of 16 he started up a band, [John Merrick](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Merrick), named after the hero of the film, The Elephant Man.      The foursome recorded around 45 sombre and tormented songs while gaving a number of concerts in the area around Nantes. Later, with the singer [Katerine](http://www.last.fm/music/Katerine), Dominique Ané recorded a number of songs in a more upbeat and livelier style.      **Beginning of a career**      At the beginning of the 1990s Dominique Ané recorded songs that were both minimalist and rock in style. He wanted to break with the traditional chanson, which he considered to be more literary than musical[1]. His first CD, released by the Nantes label, [Lithium](http://www.last.fm/label/Lithium), met with critical acclaim by the alternative magazine, Les Inrockuptibles, and by Bernard Lenoir, the ‘John Peel’ of France. Furthermore, his song, [Le Courage Des Oiseaux](http://www.last.fm/music/Dominique+A/_/Le+Courage+Des+Oiseaux), (the Courage of the Birds), was an underground hit.      From 1992 onwards, he started to produce more and more live shows, either with a backing band or solo. His commercial success grew in 1995 with [Le Twenty- two bar](http://www.last.fm/music/Dominique+A/_/Le+Twenty-two+bar), a single off the album, [La Mémoire Neuve](http://www.last.fm/music/Dominique+A/La+M%C3%A9moire+Neuve), but this success left a bitter taste in Dominique’s mouth because he considered the song to be particularly badly written[1].      In 2000, he composed the score for Antoine Desrosières’ black comedy film Banqueroute.      **Le Détour and beyond (2002-)**      Dominique’s discovery of [Alain Bashung](http://www.last.fm/music/Alain+Bashung)’s dark 2002 album, [L’Imprudence](http://www.last.fm/music/Alain+Bashung/L%27Imprudence) shocked him to the point that it put his music into question and he decided to explore different ways of working. He decided to compile what he considered to be the first part of a musical time capsule, a longbox entitled [Le Détour](http://www.last.fm/music/Dominique+A/Le+D%C3%A9tour). He asked his fans to write about their relationship with his music, and some of their letters were published in the booklet accompanying Le Détour
