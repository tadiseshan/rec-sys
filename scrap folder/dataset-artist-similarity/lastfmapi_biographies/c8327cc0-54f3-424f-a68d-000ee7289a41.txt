Sizzla Kalonji (real name Miguel Orlando Collins) is a Jamaican reggae musician. He was born on 17 April 1976, in St Mary, Jamaica, of devout Rastafari parents and raised in August Town. He is unusually prolific, even by Jamaican standards. Sizzla has worked with such artists as Mobb Deep.      [Sizzla](http://www.last.fm/music/Sizzla), along with reggae recording artists such as [Capleton](http://www.last.fm/music/Capleton), [Buju Banton](http://www.last.fm/music/Buju+Banton), and [Anthony B](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B), are credited with leading a movement toward a re-embracement of Rastafarian values in contemporary reggae music by recording material which is concerned primarily with spirituality, social consciousness, explores common themes, such as Babylon’s corrupting influence, the disenfranchisement of ghetto youth, oppression of the black nation and Sizzla’s abiding faith in Jah and resistance against perceived agents of oppression. Sizzla has over 40 full completed albums sold in record stores to date, the most popular which have been “Black Woman & Child” and “Da Real Thing” on the Digital B label, “Praise Ye Jah” on Xterminator, and “Rise to the Occasion” on Greensleeves.      Recently, however, he has come under fire for the homophobic content of many of his lyrics, and the advocacy of violence against gays.
