Born February 6, 1950, Natalie Cole is the daughter of celebrated crooner [Nat King Cole](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole), she was exposed to the greats of [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz), [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) and [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) at an early age and began performing at the age of 11. Her debut album in 1975, Inseparable, won her immediate praise, with the smash single [This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Cole/_/This+Will+Be +\(An+Everlasting+Love\)) (#1 R&B, #6 Pop) winning her a Grammy for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female, a category that had been monopolized by [Aretha Franklin](http://www.last.fm/music/Aretha+Franklin), since its inception in 1967. She also was named the Grammys’ Best New Artist of 1975. She attended the Northfield Mount Hermon School in Northfield, MA.      More hits followed through 1980, including her biggest [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) hit, 1977’s [I’ve Got Love On My Mind](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Cole/_/I%27ve+Got+Love+On+My+Mind), as well as [Sophisticated Lady (She’s A Different Lady)](http://www.last.fm/music /Natalie+Cole/_/Sophisticated+Lady+\(She%27s+A+Different+Lady\)) (1976), [Our Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Cole/_/Our+Love) (1978), and [Someone That I Used To Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Cole/_/Someone+That+I+Used+To+Love) (1980). “I’ve Got Love On My Mind” and “Our Love” both earned certifications as Gold singles. But then her career hit a snag in the early 1980s due to a severe drug problem. By 1985, Natalie was clean, sober, and in fine voice, and ready to begin her comeback in earnest with the album [Dangerous](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Cole/Dangerous), released on the Modern label.      In 1987, she released [Everlasting](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Cole/Everlasting) (on EMI Manhattan) which sold over 2 million copies in the U.S., and won Cole a Soul Train Award for Female Single of the Year for the #1 R&B ballad [I Live for Your Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Cole/_/I+Live+for+Your+Love). This album was the one that put Natalie Cole firmly back in the spotlight, yielding three major hit singles: [Jump Start](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Cole/_/Jump+Start), “I Live For Your Love” (#2 AC and #13 Pop as well as #1 R&B), and a successful remake of [Bruce Springsteen](http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen)’s [Pink Cadillac](http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Cole/_/Pink+Cadillac) (#5 Pop, #16 AC, and #1 Dance). The album also included a taste of things to come in her career with a remake of one of her father’s signature hits, “When I Fall In Love,” which did moderately well on the AC chart. In 1989, the aptly-titled Good To Be Back gave her another across-the-board smash with “Miss You Like Crazy” (#1 both R&B and AC, and #7 Pop).      However, it was her 1991 album, [Unforgettable](http://www.last
