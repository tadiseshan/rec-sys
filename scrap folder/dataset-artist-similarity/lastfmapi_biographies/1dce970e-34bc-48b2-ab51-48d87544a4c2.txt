**David Jon Gilmour**, known as [David Gilmour](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Gilmour) (born 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom) is an English musician and multi-instrumentalist, who was the guitarist, lead vocalist and one of the songwriters of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd.      Gilmour was born in **Cambridge, England**. His father, Douglas Gilmour, was a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), was a teacher and film editor who raised her family at Grantchester Meadows, later immortalised by a [Roger Waters](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Waters) song on [Pink Floyd](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd)’s [Ummagumma](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/Ummagumma). Gilmour and his siblings were encouraged by their parents in their musical abilities. Gilmour has a younger brother, Peter, who has been a guitarist for a slightly longer time than Gilmour. Gilmour attended The Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he “didn’t enjoy” but where he met future Pink Floyd guitarist and vocalist [Syd Barrett](http://www.last.fm/music/Syd+Barrett), along with bassist and vocalist Roger Waters who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, also situated on Hills Road. In 1954, Gilmour bought his first single, [Bill Haley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Haley)’s “Rock Around the Clock”. At age 13, Gilmour was given his first guitar, a Tatay, by his neighbour, Gilmour started learning how to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger.      In September 1962, he studied modern languages to A-Level and, along with Syd Barrett, went to Cambridge Technical College. Despite not finishing the languages course, Gilmour would eventually become a fluent French speaker. Gilmour and Barrett spent their lunchtime practising guitar together, Barrett would often refer to Gilmour as “Fred”. They were not yet bandmates, however, and Gilmour started playing in the band Jokers Wild in 1962, which Gilmour left in 1967.      Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in 1968, when he was asked to replace former front man and guitarist [Syd Barrett](http://www.last.fm/music/Syd+Barrett). Barrett was becoming increasingly difficult to work with (due to his deteriorating mental state), so Gilmour stepped in to fill the void. Gilmour’s contributions helped to define what would become known as the “Pink Floyd” sound. With [Roger Waters](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Waters), Gilmour co-wrote many of Pink Floyd’s classic songs, including “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”(Itself about Syd), “Wish You Were Here” (about Roger’s father) , “Time”, “Dogs”, “Echoes”, “Comfortably Numb”, and “Run Like Hell”. When Waters left the band in 1984 to pursue a solo career, Gilmour took over Pink Floyd as leader, and they released two more albums, [A Momentary Lapse of Reason](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/A+Momentary+Lapse+of+Reason) (1987), and [The Division Bell](http://www.last
