Jay Brannan is a Texas born singer, [actor](http://www.last.fm/tag/actor), and [songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/songwriter). After finding homes all over the country to live in, and briefly attending University of Cincinnati’s acting school, he decided to plant his feet down in New York City.      Brannan was cast in 2003 for the movie Shortbus, directed by John Cameron Mitchell. He contributed the song [Soda Shop](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Brannan/_/Soda+Shop) to the film’s soundtrack, which he stated was his “first professionally recorded track”.      Relatively new to the music world, he has released several songs on iTunes and on [his myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/jaybrannan), has become extremely popular thanks to [his YouTube profile](http://www.youtube.com/user/jaybrannan), and has been keen on maintaining a self-produced, low-key [website](http://www.jaybrannan.com).      His songs hold many of the same universal themes other artists acclaim to, but with a more [fresh](http://www.last.fm/tag/fresh), realistic, sometimes vulgar, understanding. This has made him a hero to other gay men and general audiences alike.      Official Website:   [www.jaybrannan.com](http://www.jaybrannan.com)
