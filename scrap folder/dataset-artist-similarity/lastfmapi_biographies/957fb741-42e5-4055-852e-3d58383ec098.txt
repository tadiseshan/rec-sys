Eva Dahlgren is a Swedish pop musician, born 9 June 1960 in Umeå, Sweden. Dahlgren was discovered by musician/producer Bruno Glenmark in 1978 after appearing on the TV show “Sveriges magasin” and her debut album _Finns det nån som bryr sej om_ was released the same year. In 1979 she placed third in Melodifestivalen (the tryout competition for the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden). Dahlgren’s career grew steadly with several album releases during the 1980s, but her definite breakthrough in Sweden came in 1991 with the hit album [En blekt blondins hjärta](http://www.last.fm/music/Eva+Dahlgren/En+blekt+blondins+hj%C3%A4rta) which sold over half a million copies and netted the singer five Grammis awards. In 1996 Dahlgren made headlines in the Swedish press when she came out as a lesbian through her civil union with jewellery designer Efva Attling. In connection with the civil union, Dahlgren changed her surname to Dahlgren- Attling.
