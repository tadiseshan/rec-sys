Yma Sumac (September 13, 1922 – November 1, 2008) was the stage name of a [peruvian](http://www.last.fm/tag/peruvian) singer named [Zoila Augusta Emperatriz Chavarri del Castillo](http://www.last.fm/music/Zoila+Augusta+Emper atriz+Chavarri+del+Castillo). When still a child in rural [Peru](http://www.last.fm/place/Peru), she attracted notice for her extraordinary voice, and joined the Compañía Peruana de Arte in the early 1940s.      Yma Súmac was born in Ichocán, Cajamarca, Peru. Other dates mentioned in her various biographies range from 1921 to 1929. Some sources claim that she was not born in Ichocán, but in a nearby village or possibly in Lima, and that her family owned a ranch in Ichocán where she spent most of her early life. Stories published in the 1950s claimed that she was an Incan princess directly descended from Atahualpa. A story claiming that she was actually born Amy Camus (Yma Sumac backwards) in Brooklyn or Canada was fabricated while she was performing in New York City in the early 1950s. She adopted the stage name of [Imma Sumack](http://www.last.fm/music/Imma+Sumack) (also spelled Ymma Sumack and Ima Sumack) in South America before she went to the U.S. The stage name was based on her mother’s name which was derived from Ima Shumaq, Quechua for “how beautiful!” although in interviews she claimed it meant “beautiful flower” or “beautiful girl”.      Imma Sumack first appeared on radio in 1942, and married composer and bandleader [Moisés Vivanco](http://www.last.fm/music/Mois%C3%A9s+Vivanco) on June 6 the same year. She recorded at least 23 tracks of Peruvian folk songs in Argentina in 1943 . These early recordings for the [Odeon](http://www.last.fm/label/Odeon) label featured Moisés Vivanco’s group, Compañía Peruana de Arte, a group of 46 Indian dancers singers and musicians. In 1946, Sumack and Vivanco moved to New York City, where they performed as the Inca Taky Trio: Sumack herself singing coloratura soprano, Vivanco on guitar and her cousin Cholita Rivero singing contralto and dancing. Sumack bore a son, Charles, in 1949, and was signed by [Capitol Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Capitol+Records) in 1950, at which time her stage name became “Yma Sumac”.      During the 1950s, Yma Sumac produced a series of legendary lounge music recordings featuring Hollywood-style versions of Incan and South American folk songs, working with the likes of [Les Baxter](http://www.last.fm/music/Les+Baxter) and [Billy May](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+May). In 1951, she popularized [Jorge Bravo de Rueda](http://www.last.fm/music/Jorge+Bravo+de+Rueda)’s classic song [Vírgenes del Sol](http://www.last.fm/music/Yma+Sumac/_/V%C3%ADrgenes+del+Sol). The combination of her extraordinary voice, exotic looks and stage personality made her a hit with American audiences. Sumac even appeared in a Broadway musical, Flahooley, in 1951, as a foreign princess who brings Aladdin’s lamp to an American toy factory to have it repaired
