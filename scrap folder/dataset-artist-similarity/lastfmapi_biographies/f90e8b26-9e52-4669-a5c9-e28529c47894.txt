Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr. (born October 20, 1971 in Long Beach, California, United States), better known by his stage name Snoop Dogg, is a Grammy award nominated rapper, producer and actor. Snoop is best known as a famous MC in the West Coast hip hop scene, and for being one of producer [Dr. Dre](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre)’s most notable protégés. He made his rap debut in 1992 on Dre’s debut album The Chronic, and then released his debut album, Doggystyle, to much critical and public acclaim. His mother nicknamed him “Snoopy” as a child, and he took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg when he began recording. He changed his name to Snoop Dogg in 1996 when he left his original record label, Death Row Records, and signed with No Limit Records.      He has been affiliated with the Crips, a U.S. street gang. Several of his cousins, including [RBX](http://www.last.fm/music/RBX), [Nate Dogg](http://www.last.fm/music/Nate+Dogg), [Daz Dillinger](http://www.last.fm/music/Daz+Dillinger), and [Warren G](http://www.last.fm/music/Warren+G) are also hip hop artists and often collaborate with Snoop. In 2000, Snoop (as “Michael J. Corleone”) directed Snoop Dogg’s Doggystyle, a pornographic film produced by Hustler. This film, combining hip-hop with X-rated material, was a huge success and won “Top Selling Release of the Year” at the 2002 AVN Awards. Driven by this success, Snoop directed Snoop Dogg’s Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp in 2002 (this time using the nickname “Snoop Scorsese”).      As a rapper, he is perhaps best known for his “lazy drawl” — a slurred, distinctively calm, laid-back, and rhythmically-complex lyrical delivery. His [lyrics](http://www.lyricsleach.com/artist/SNOOP+DOGG) have often been criticized for their glorification of misogyny, violence and gangsterism; however, he is often credited for accurately portraying street slang and attitudes.
