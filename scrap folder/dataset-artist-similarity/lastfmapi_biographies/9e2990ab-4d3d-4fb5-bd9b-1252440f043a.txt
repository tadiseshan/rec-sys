Kwasi Danquah (born September 14, 1986), better known by his stage name Tinchy Stryder, is a British [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) [grime](http://www.last.fm/tag/grime) vocalist. Stryder is from Bow, East London and attended St Bonaventure’s Catholic Comprehensive School in Forest Gate, Newham; he later enrolled as a student at the local university, the University of East London, where he completed his BA degree in moving image and animation in 2009. He rose to popularity with the song [Take Me Back](http://www.last.fm/music/Tinchy+Stryder/_/Take+Me+Back), (a collaboration with [Taio Cruz](http://www.last.fm/music/Taio+Cruz)) which peaked at #3 on the UK Singles Chart in January 2009. He then released the aptly named song [Number 1](http://www.last.fm/music/Tinchy+Stryder/_/Number+1), (a collaboration with [N-Dubz](http://www.last.fm/music/N-Dubz)) which entered the UK chart at #1 on 26 April 2009.      Stryder started at the age of 14 on pirate radio sets in East London with other well known grime MCs such as Wiley and Dizzee Rascal. His stage name derives from the video game Strider which he played when he was young and from the nickname “Tinchy” given to him due to his short stature: his height at 5’1” (1.55m) making him the shortest male artist ever to top the UK Top 40. Tinchy made a number of appearances on Sky’s Channel U and especially their 1Xtanra radio show taking part in freestyles, sometimes joined by his crew Ruff Sqwad. Tinchy Stryder was part of a spectacular line up at The O2 arena 3D ELEKTRO RAVE alongside Caspa and Rusko, Frankmusik, High Contrast and Dancing Robot Music.[7] Tinchy Stryder was part of well-known grime crew Roll Deep for a while, featuring on some songs including ‘U Were Always’, which was released years later on Roll Deep’s compilations album, Street Anthems.      Many before him have tried and failed; in April 2009 Tinchy Stryder became the first artist ever to reach number 1 in the official national singles charts with a song title featuring the phrase ‘number one’. A self-fulfilling prophecy personified? Well, he’s certainly living up to his music moniker ‘Star in the Hood’.      Over the past six months, 23 year-old Tinchy has signed a recording deal with Island Records and has racked up three consecutive top 3 hits, ‘Take Me Back’ feat. Taio Cruz, released in January debuted at no 39 on downloads alone, the following week on it’s official release the single climbed 36 places to number 3, and maintained a Top 5 position for four weeks. In April, ‘Number 1’ feat. N-Dubz debuted at Number 1 and topped the UK charts for a whopping three weeks, this was followed in August by Tinchy’s second 1 single ‘Never Leave You’ featuring Amelle from the Sugababes.      Tinchy Stryder, is undoubtedly one of the UK’s most exciting artists, The Independent recently said, “If Grime was the football world, Tinchy Stryder would be like your Michael Owens and Wayne Rooney’s of today
