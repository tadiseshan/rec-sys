**Jerry Reed Hubbard** (1937-2008), known professionally as Jerry Reed, was an American country music singer, country guitarist, session musician, songwriter, and actor who appeared in over a dozen films       Reed was born on the 20th March 1937 in Atlanta, Georgia, the second child of Robert and Cynthia Hubbard. Reed’s parents separated four months after his birth, and he and his sister spent seven years in foster homes or orphanages. Reed was reunited with his mother and stepfather in 1944.      By high school (O’Keefe High School, Atlanta, Georgia) Reed was already writing and singing music, having picked up the guitar as a child. At the age of eighteen he was signed by publisher and record producer Bill Lowery to make his first record, “If the Good Lord’s Willing and the Creeks Don’t Rise”. At Capitol Records, he recorded both country and rockabilly singles with little success, until label mate [Gene Vincent](http://www.last.fm/music/Gene+Vincent) covered his “[Crazy Legs](http://www.last.fm/music/Gene+Vincent/_/Crazy+Legs)” in 1958. By 1958, Lowery signed Reed to his National Recording Corporation, and he recorded for NRC as both artist and as a member of the staff band, which included other NRC artists [Joe South](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+South) and [Ray Stevens](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Stevens).      Reed married Priscilla Mitchell in 1959. They have two daughters, Charlotte Elaine Reed Stewart, and Seidina Ann Reed Hinesley.      After a two-year stint in the military, Reed moved to Nashville in 1961 to continue his songwriting career, which had continued to gather steam while he was in the armed forces, thanks to [Brenda Lee](http://www.last.fm/music/Brenda+Lee)’s 1960 cover of his “That’s All You Got to Do”. He also became a popular session and tour guitarist. In 1962, he scored some success with the singles “[Goodnight Irene](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Reed/_/Goodnight+Irene)” and “[Hully Gully Guitar](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Reed/_/Hully+Gully+Guitar)”, which found their way to [Chet Atkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Chet+Atkins), who produced Reed’s 1965 “If I Don’t Live Up to It”.      In 1967 Reed had his first chart hit with “[Guitar Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Reed/_/Guitar+Man)”, which [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley) soon covered. Presley had gone to Nashville to record in 1967, and one of the songs he was working on was “Guitar Man,” which Reed had written and recorded. Jarvis hired Reed to play on the session. Reed also played the guitar for Presley’s “[Too Much Monkey Business](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/Too+Much+Monkey+Business)” (1968), recorded at the same session. After Presley recorded another of Reed’s songs, “[U.S. Male](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/U.S.+Male)”, the songwriter recorded an Elvis tribute, “[Tupelo Mississippi Flash](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Reed/_/Tupelo+Mississippi+Flash)”, which became his first top-twenty hit
