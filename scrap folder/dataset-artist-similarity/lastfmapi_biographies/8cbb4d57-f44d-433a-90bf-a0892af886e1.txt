**Mariza Nunes** (born December 16, 1973 in [Mozambique](http://www.last.fm/place/Mozambique)) is a [fado](http://www.last.fm/tag/fado) singer-songwriter on the World Connection label. She moved to [Portugal](http://www.last.fm/place/Portugal) when she was three, and was raised in one of the most traditional quarters of Lisbon, Mouraria, where she learned how to sing fado. She has a Portuguese father but her mother is from Mozambique (the song [Transparente](http://www.last.fm/music/Mariza/_/Transparente) is a tribute to her African grandmother).      For the Olympic Games of Athens 2004 she collaborated with [Sting](http://www.last.fm/music/Sting) for the duet “[A Thousand Years](http://www.last.fm/music/Mariza/_/A+Thousand+Years)”, released on the official pop album of the Athens Olympics Unity, where fado is sung in both English and Portuguese.      Mariza is considered by many as a more contemporary follower of [Amalia Rodrigues](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Amalia+Rodrigues), and has covered a number of her songs.      In 2003 she became the “Winner in the Europe category” of the BBC Radio 3 Awards for [world](http://www.last.fm/tag/world) Music.      **Discography:**      Fado em Mim (2002)   Fado Curvo (2003)   Live in London (2005) DVD   Transparente (2005)   Concerto em Lisboa (2006) DVD and CD   Terra (2008)   Fado Tradicional (2010).      <http://www.myspace.com/fadomariza>   [http://www.marizafriends.blogspot.com/](http://www.last.fm/out?url=http%3A%2F %2Fwww.marizafriends.blogspot.com%2F)
