Dave Alvin (born November 11, 1955, in Downey, California), is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. He has been one of the leading proponents of ‘roots’ or ‘American’ music, bringing together elements of rock-and-roll, blues, rural and tejano music.      Alvin and his older brother [Phil Alvin](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Alvin) grew up loving Americana, country and blues. In 1979 they formed [The Blasters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Blasters) with friends [Bill Bateman](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Bateman) and John Bazz.      Shortly after leaving the Blasters, Alvin joined [X](http://www.last.fm/music/X) as lead guitarist after the departure of [Billy Zoom](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Zoom). Alvin amicably left the group to work on a solo project shortly after the recording sessions for their album See How We Are. Alvin is also a member of country band [The Knitters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Knitters) (composed mainly of members of X), appearing on 1987’s Poor Little Critter on the Road and the 2005 follow-up, The Modern Sounds of The Knitters.      In the early 1980s Alvin, along with fellow Blasters members Bill Bateman and Steve Berlin, performed on several albums with the Los Angeles punk band [The Flesh Eaters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Flesh+Eaters). These albums are considered precursors to what is now called “deathrock”. Alvin also played with the band [The Gun Club](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Gun+Club) briefly, playing guitar on “Eternally Is Here” & “The Stranger in Our Town” from the 1984 album, The Las Vegas Story.      Alvin’s first solo album, entitled Romeo’s Escape (1987) in the United States and Every Night About This Time in England, added a purer country influence along with a larger side-portion of the blues; while the album was critically well received, it didn’t fare well in the marketplace, and Alvin was dropped by his American record label, Columbia. Alvin suffered health problems which sidelined him for a while, except for a wild tour with friends Mojo Nixon and Country Dick Montana as the Pleasure Barons, which was described as “a Las Vegas revue from acts who aren’t going to be asked to play Vegas.” (A live album was released of a second Pleasure Barons tour in 1993.)      In 1989, Dwight Yoakam scored a hit on the country charts with Alvin’s song “Long White Cadillac,” and Alvin used the royalties to start work on his second solo set, Blue Blvd. Released by the California-based roots-music label Hightone Records in 1991, Blue Blvd received enthusiastic reviews and sold well enough to re-establish Alvin as a significant artist in the roots rock scene
