[Eberhard Weber](http://www.last.fm/music/Eberhard+Weber) (born 1940 in Stuttgart, [Germany](http://www.last.fm/place/Germany)) is a [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) [bassist](http://www.last.fm/tag/bassist). He began recording in the early 1960s, and released his first record under his own name in 1973. In addition to his career as a [musician](http://www.last.fm/tag/musician), he also worked for many years as a television and theater director. He has designed an electric-acoustic [bass](http://www.last.fm/tag/bass) featuring an extra C-string.      His [music](http://www.last.fm/tag/music), often in a [melancholic](http://www.last.fm/tag/melancholic) tone, follows simple ground patterns (frequently ostinatos), yet is highly organized in its coloring and attention to dramatic detail.      Weber was a notable early proponent of the solid-body electric double bass, which he has played regularly since the beginning of the 1970s.      From the early 1960s to the early 1970s, his closest musical association was with [pianist](http://www.last.fm/tag/pianist) [Wolfgang Dauner](http://www.last.fm/music/Wolfgang+Dauner). Their many mutual projects were very diverse, from mainstream jazz to jazz-rock [fusion](http://www.last.fm/tag/fusion) to [avant- garde](http://www.last.fm/tag/avant-garde) sound experiments. During this period he also played and recorded with (among many others) pianists [Hampton Hawes](http://www.last.fm/music/Hampton+Hawes) and [Mal Waldron](http://www.last.fm/music/Mal+Waldron), guitarists [Baden Powell](http://www.last.fm/music/Baden+Powell) and [Joe Pass](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Pass), and [violinist](http://www.last.fm/tag/violinist) [Stephane Grappelli](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Stephane+Grappelli).      In 1973 he made his first record as a leader, The Colours of Chloë, for ECM Records. Since then he has released 10 more records under his own name, all on ECM. The ECM association also led to collaborations with other ECM recording artists such as [Gary Burton](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Burton) (Ring, 1974; Passengers, 1976), [Ralph Towner](http://www.last.fm/music/Ralph+Towner) (Solstice, 1974; Sound and Shadows, 1977), [Pat Metheny](http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Metheny) (Watercolors, 1977), and [Jan Garbarek](http://www.last.fm/music/Jan+Garbarek) (9 recordings between 1978 and 1998).      In the mid-1970s he formed his own group, Colours, with [Charlie Mariano](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Mariano) (soprano saxophone, flutes), [Rainer Brüninghaus](http://www.last.fm/music/Rainer+Br%C3%BCninghaus) (piano, synthesizer), and [Jon Christensen](http://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Christensen) (drums). After their first recording, Yellow Fields (1975), Christensen left and was replaced by [John Marshall](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Marshall). The group toured extensively and recorded two further records, Silent Feet (1977) and Little Movements (1980), before disbanding
