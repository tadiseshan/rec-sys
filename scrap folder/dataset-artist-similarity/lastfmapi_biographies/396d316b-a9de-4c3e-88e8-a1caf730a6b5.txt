Claude Kelly was born to Jamaican immigrants in the 1980s. He began playing the piano at the age of 2 and by middle school mastered the flute. After high school, Kelly attended the prestigious Berklee College of Music, and after graduation in 2002 returned to Manhattan. Through networking and word of mouth, Kelly met as many producers as he could, and by 2002 had written a song that ended up a compilation by the Japanese clothing line A Bathing Ape. “It was a lucky break,” he said. “It boosted my confidence.” Kelly got his big break when he wrote the song, “Daddy’s Little Girl” for Frankie J’s 2006 album, Priceless. Although it didn’t chart well, he said, watching his song go from recording to mixing to mastering to music video was the confirmation that he needed to press on. Kelly’s work so impressed Akon that in late 2007, the singer suggested Kelly write to some of his music, one of which was “Forgive Me”, written for Leona Lewis’ debut album and produced by Akon respectively. Another song he wrote was “Hold My Hand” which was set to feature on Akon’s third album, however the song leaked and it was decided not to be included in the album. The song features Michael Jackson. At present, he’s working with Whitney Houston and Christina Aguilera.
