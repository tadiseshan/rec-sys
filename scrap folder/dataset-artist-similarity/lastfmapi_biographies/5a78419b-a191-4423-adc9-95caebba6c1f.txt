Rino Gaetano (born Salvatore Antonio Gaetano in Crotone, Calabria on 29 October 1950; died in Rome on 2 June 1981) was an Italian [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) of the 1970s who combined commercial pop and rock influences with traditional Italian styles. He achieved considerable success in his home country before his death in a car accident, and his work is still highly regarded for its blend of wit, romance, sentimentality and social and political commentary.
