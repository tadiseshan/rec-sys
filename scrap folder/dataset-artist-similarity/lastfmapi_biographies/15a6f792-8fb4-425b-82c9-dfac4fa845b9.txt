Serena Ryder is a Canadian singer/songwriter who is from Millbrook, near Peterborough, Ontario. She performed in many venues around Ontario from the age of 18, including being showcased at the CBC Women’s Blues Review 2002 at the Music Hall, Danforth Avenue, Ontario at 19. She has a “fearless” approach to performing. Her voice is mature beyond her years, with tremor and vivacity of a seasoned blues singer. Promotional CDs (‘A Day at the Studio’ and others) were available at some of her early performances and since then she has released three albums.      In 2004 she released her debut album [Unlikely Emergency](http://www.last.fm/music/Serena+Ryder/Unlikely+Emergency), which included the single “Just Another Day” which gained significant airplay on many Canadian radio stations. The album was released with the production help of Hawksley Workman, who contacted the CBC after hearing her perform on a local Live radio broadcast. The album was recorded at his studio and released on Workman’s Isadora imprint.      Serena is currently signed to EMI Music Canada, and in late 2006, she released her major label debut featuring a collection of Canadian cover songs [If Your Memory Serves You Well](http://www.last.fm/music/Serena+Ryder/If+Your+Memory+Serves+You+Well). This sophomore release featured three originals, including the standout single “Weak In The Knees”, which was also featured on the 2007 ‘Women & Songs Volume 11’ compilation.      Ryder soon found herself opening major concerts for the likes of [Aerosmith](http://www.last.fm/music/Aerosmith) and she won the 2008 Juno Award for “Best New Artist.”      In November 2008, Serena released her third album, [Is it o.k.](http://www.last.fm/music/Serena+Ryder/Is+it+o.k.), mixing original work with a reprise of “Weak In The Knees”. She was nominated for two Juno Awards for 2009 - including ‘Artist of the Year’ and ‘Adult Alternative Album of the Year’ for “Is it o.k.”, which was eventually released in the USA almost a year later on Atlantic Records. Serena generated further awareness stateside with a duet with American Idol graduate [Jason Castro](http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Castro) on his debut album.
