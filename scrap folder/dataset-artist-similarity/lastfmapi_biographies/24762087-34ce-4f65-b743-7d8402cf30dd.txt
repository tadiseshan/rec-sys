Joshua Radin is an [acoustic](http://www.last.fm/tag/acoustic) singer/songwriter from Cleveland, Ohio. When close friend and actor/film-maker Zach Braff heard a demo of Radin’s song “Winter,” he was immediately interested, and got the song onto the show Scrubs in the episode “My Screw Up.” The song received an overwhelmingly positive response and gave Radin substantial exposure with the show’s demographic. The songs “Today”, “Closer”, “Don’t Look Away” and “These Photographs” were also used on the show.      Since, Joshua’s songs have been further featured on the FOX Television drama North Shore, Bones and the ABC medical drama Grey’s Anatomy. His song “Star Mile” is on The Last Kiss movie soundtrack. Most recently his song “What If You” was featured on the Catch and Release soundtrack. He also has a couple tracks on the Adam soundtrack, including “When I Find You.”      The album “We Were Here” was released in 2006, containing many of the songs featured on the various television shows. The album is made up of heavily acoustic indie Folk/Pop, and is especially reminiscent of Simon & Garfunkel, Elliott Smith, Jode Gannon, Damien Rice and Iron & Wine.      Joshua Radin is featured in [Ashtar Command](http://www.last.fm/music/Ashtar+Command)’s song “Mark IV” from the band’s debut LP American Sunshine.
