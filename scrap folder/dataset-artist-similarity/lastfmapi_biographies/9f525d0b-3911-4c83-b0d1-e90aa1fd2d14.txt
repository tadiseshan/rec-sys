Buju Banton (born Mark Myrie 1973) is a Jamaican [dancehall](http://www.last.fm/tag/dancehall), [ragga](http://www.last.fm/tag/ragga), and [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae) singer. He was born in a slum near Kingston, Jamaica called Salt Lane. “Buju” is a nickname which is of Breadfruit. The name is ironic in light of Mark Myrie’s slim frame and large head, but it is, nevertheless, the nickname his mother gave him as a child. “Banton” is a Jamaican word referring to someone with a superior attitude and a gift with speech, but it was also the name of a local artist [Burro Banton](http://www.last.fm/music/Burro+Banton) that Buju admired as a child. It was Burro’s rough gravelly vocals that Buju emulated and ultimately made his own. Buju’s mother was a higgler, or street vendor while his father worked as a labourer at a tile factory. He was one of fifteen children born into a family which was directly descended from the Maroons, a group of escaped slaves who proudly fought off the British colonialists.      As a youngster, Buju would often watch his favourite artists perform at outdoor shows and local dancehalls. At the tender age of 13 he picked up the microphone for himself and began toasting under the monicker of “Gargamel”. His first single, “[The Ruler](http://www.last.fm/music/Buju+Banton/_/The+Ruler)” was released not long afterwards in 1987 under the production of Robert French at Penthouse Studios.      In 1991, Buju joined Donovan Germain’s [Penthouse](http://www.last.fm/label/Penthouse) Label and began a fruitful partnership with producer Dave Kelly. Buju is one of the most popular musicians in Jamaican history, having burst onto the charts there suddenly in 1992, with “[Bogle](http://www.last.fm/music/Buju+Banton/_/Bogle)” and “[Love Me Browning](http://www.last.fm/music/Buju+Banton/_/Love+Me+Browning)/[Love Black Woman](http://www.last.fm/music/Buju+Banton/_/Love+Black+Woman)”, both massive hits in Jamaica. Controversy erupted over Love Me Browning which spoke of Banton’s preference for light-skinned women: “Mi love mi car mi love mi house mi love mi money and ting, but most of all mi love mi browning.” Some accused Banton of promoting a colonialist attitude and denigrating the beauty of black women. In response, he released “[Black Woman](http://www.last.fm/music/Buju+Banton/_/Black+Woman)” which spoke of his love for dark-skinned beauties: “Stop cry, fi all black woman, respect all the gyals with dark complexion.” 1992 was an explosive year for Buju as he broke the great [Bob Marley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley)’s record for the greatest number of number one singles in a year. Beginning with “[Man Fi Dead](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Buju+Banton/_/Man+Fi+Dead)”, Buju’s gruff voice dominated the Jamaican airwaves for the duration of the year. Banton’s debut album, [Mr. Mention](http://www.last.fm/music/Buju+Banton/Mr.+Mention), includes his greatest hits from that year
