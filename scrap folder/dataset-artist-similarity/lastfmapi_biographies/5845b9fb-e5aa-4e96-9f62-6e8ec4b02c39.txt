**Ivor Cutler** (January 15th, 1923 – March 3rd, 2006) was a Scottish poet, songwriter and humorist. Originally a teacher, he taught at A.S. Neill’s Summerhill School. He appeared in [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles)’ Magical Mystery Tour film,” on [Neil Innes](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Innes)’s television programmes, and on [john peel](http://www.last.fm/tag/john%20peel)’s influential BBC radio programme, for which he recorded a total of twenty-one sessions between 1969 and 1991. In live performances he would accompany himself on a harmonium.      Many of his poems and songs involve conversations delivered as a monologue and, in these, one party is often Cutler as a child. The humour often develops from the child’s curiosity and the playful or self-serving lies the parent tells him to get, for example, a chore done or simply to stop the incessant questions. More of Cutler’s poetry is in the form of short, almost epigrammatic, observations and micro-dramas, usually surreal. He could draw impossible pictures of the thoughts and actions of ordinary people, animals, or objects with the same sense of an outsider’s wonder.      Cutler was born in Glasgow, Ｓcotland into a middle-class Jewish family of eastern European descent. He cited his childhood as the source of his artistic temperament, recalling a sense of displacement when his younger brother was born: “Without that I would not have been so screwed up as I am, and therefore not as creative.” In 1939 Cutler was evacuated to Annan. He joined the Royal Air Force as a navigator in 1942 but was soon dismissed for “dreaminess”. He moved to London where he was employed by the Inner London Education Authority to teach music, dance, drama and poetry to 7- to 11-year-olds. Cutler’s deeply held views on humanity meant he disliked corporal punishment, and on leaving a teaching job he held in the 1950s, he cut up his tawse (an implement for physical punishment) and handed the pieces to the class. He was married briefly and had two children.      Cutler began writing songs and poetry in the late 1950s, making the first of many appearances on BBC radio on the Home Service, where he featured on the Monday Night at Home programme on 38 occasions between 1959 and 1963. He gained popularity playing songs where he would often accompany himself on the harmonium, and this success led to the release of a series a records starting with 1959’s Ivor Cutler of Y’Hup EP. Cutler continued to make appearances on the BBC’s programmes during the 1960s, and as a result of an appearance on the television show Late Night Line-Up, he was noticed by [Paul McCartney](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney), who invited Cutler to appear in [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles)’ Magical Mystery Tour film. In the film, Cutler plays bus conductor Buster Bloodvessel, who becomes passionately attracted to [Ringo Starr](http://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Starr)’s Aunt Jessie
