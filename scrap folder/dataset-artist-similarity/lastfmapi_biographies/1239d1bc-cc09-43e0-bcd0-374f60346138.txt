**Kelis** Rogers-Jones (born Kelis Rogers on August 21, 1979), is known simply by her first name **Kelis** (pronounced Kuh-lees). Her name is an amalgamation of her parents’ first names, her black father Kenneth and Chinese-Puerto Rican mother Eveliss. Growing up in Middle Class Harlem, New York **Kelis’** childhood was not a deprived one. But she was not without problems, after her parents realised they could not cope with her unruly behavior (Kelis shaved all her hair off at age 13, soon afterwards dyeing the regrowth the colors of the rainbow), Kelis moved out of the family home, continuing her private education.      After a short spell working as a model, 5’10” Kelis began appearing on songs by Neptunes produced rappers such as _’Got Your Money’_ by the late rapper [Ol’ Dirty Bastard](http://www.last.fm/music/Ol%27+Dirty+Bastard). Soon afterwards, she released her debut album, **Kaleidoscope **in 1999 of which the first single was _’Caught Out There,’_ a song based on the time she caught her boyfriend cheating on her, and she beat him. The video feautures Kelis leading a pack of angry women down the street screaming ‘I hate you so much right now!’. The album was released in USA, Europe and Asia, but did not find much audience in the USA. Not a great success, it only sold 249,000 copies to date.      After finding her largest audience in Europe, Kelis released her second album titled **Wanderland **(2001) in Europe only, which like her first album did not fare well. It only sold 80,000 copies and was entirely produced by The Neptunes ([Pharrell Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Pharrell+Williams) and Chad Hugo) again, similarly to her debut. Only one single was released _’Young Fresh N New’_.      In 2003 Kelis finally found fame in her country with the single _’Milkshake,’_ which was a massive success in Europe, Asia and USA, and she began dating rapper [Nas](http://www.last.fm/music/Nas) (born Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones). The single was from the album **’Tasty’** which did not feature the Neptunes as heavily as her previous albums. Singles included the popular Dallas Austin produced _’Trick Me’_ and _’Millionaire’,_ a collaboration with [OutKast](http://www.last.fm/music/OutKast)’s [Andre 3000](http://www.last.fm/music/Andre+3000). _’In Public’_s duet with Nas was the fourth single from the album, becoming a top twenty hit in the U.K. without a video.      In 2006, Kelis presented a new album to her fans, entitled **Kelis Was Here**, which was originally to be called ‘The Puppeteer’ which was released on 22 August but was due Fall 2005. No Neptunes tracks appeared on this album, but Kelis used other producers such as Max Martin, [will.i.am](http://www.last.fm/music/will.i.am) (Black Eyed Peas) and [Raphael Saadiq](http://www.last.fm/music/Raphael+Saadiq). Singles are the huge _’Bossy’_, _’Blindfold Me’,_ and _’Lil Star’
