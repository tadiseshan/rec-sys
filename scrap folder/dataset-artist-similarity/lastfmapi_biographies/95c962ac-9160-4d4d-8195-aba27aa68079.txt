**Sleepy Sleepers** were found in 1974 in Lahti, Finland, by [Mato Valtonen](http://www.last.fm/music/Mato+Valtonen) and Sakke Järvenpää. The band released 19 albums between 1975 and 1989. Their songs were laden with frivolous, sometimes scatological humor and jokes considered politically sensitive in post-war atmosphere of Finlandization. This led to problems getting gigs and, some of their songs being banned in then state-controlled mass media.    Later, Valtonen and Järvenpää founded [Leningrad Cowboys](http://www.last.fm/music/Leningrad+Cowboys), when Aki Kaurismäki made movie [Leningrad Cowboys Go America](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097728/).
