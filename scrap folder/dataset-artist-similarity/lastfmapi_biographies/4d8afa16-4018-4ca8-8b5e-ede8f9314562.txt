**The Animals** were a British [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band of the 1960s, formed in Newcastle. They were part of the [british invasion](http://www.last.fm/tag/british%20invasion), being one of the most popular bands of their era. Known for their gritty, raw, bluesy sound and hard-voiced frontman [Eric Burdon](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Burdon), as exemplified by their signature songs [House of the Rising Sun](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Animals/_/House+of+the+Rising+Sun) and [Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Animals/_/Don%27t+Let+Me+Be+Misunderstood), the band underwent numerous personnel changes, while influencing the later [heavy metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/heavy%20metal) music with the riffs of their rock songs such as [We Gotta Get Out Of This Place](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Animals/_/We+Gotta+Get+Out+Of+This+Place) and [It’s My Life](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Animals/_/It%27s+My+Life). They emerged as an exponent of psychedelic music before dissolving at the end of the decade. In 1983 they had a comeback and toured for six months before disbanding forever.      History   First incarnation      Formed in Newcastle-upon-Tyne during 1962 and 1963 when Burdon joined the existing Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo, the original line-up comprised [Eric Burdon](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Burdon) (vocals), [Alan Price](http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Price) (organ and keyboards), [Hilton Valentine](http://www.last.fm/music/Hilton+Valentine) (guitar), John Steel (drums), and Bryan “Chas” Chandler (bass). The Animals’ moderate success in their hometown and a connection with [The Yardbirds](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Yardbirds) manager Giorgio Gomelsky motivated them to move to London in 1964, in time to be grouped with the British Invasion. They performed fiery versions of the staple rhythm and blues repertoire ([Jimmy Reed](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Reed), [John Lee Hooker](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lee+Hooker), [Nina Simone](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Simone), etc). Signed to the Columbia Graphophone subsidiary of EMI, a rocking version of the standard “Baby Let Me Follow You Down” (retitled [Baby Let Me Take You Home](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Animals/_/Baby+Let+Me+Take+You+Home)) was their first UK hit single.      It was followed in June 1964 by the huge transatlantic hit “House of the Rising Sun”. Burdon’s howling vocals and the dramatic arrangement created arguably the first folk rock hit.
