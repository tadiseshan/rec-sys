Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno, (born 15 May 1948 and originally christened Brian Peter George Eno), professionally known as Brian Eno or simply as Eno, is an English musician, composer, record producer, singer, music theorist and visual artist, commonly known as the father of [ambient](http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient) music. Eno’s solo music has explored experimental musical styles and mostly ambient music. He has also been immensely influential, pioneering both ambient and generative music, innovating production techniques, and emphasizing ‘theory over practice’. He also introduced the concept of chance music to popular audiences, partially through collaborations with other musicians.      Eno first came to prominence as the keyboard and synthesizer player and general sonic wizard in the [glam rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/glam%20rock) and [art rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/art%20rock) band [Roxy Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music). After leaving Roxy Music, Eno recorded four highly idiosyncratic and original [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) albums, later turning to more abstract sound-scapes on subsequent albums such as 1975’s _[Discreet Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno/Discreet+Music)_ and 1978’s _[Ambient 1: Music for Airports](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno/Ambient+1:+Music+for+Airports)_. Since then, he has released dozens of albums (many in collaboration with like- minded musicians, such as [Harold Budd](http://www.last.fm/music/Harold+Budd) and [Robert Fripp](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Fripp)) which demonstrate his unique approach to music. He has, however, occasionally returned to the [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) idioms which were more prominent in his earliest work, including a collaboration with former Velvet Underground member [John Cale](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Cale).      His production credits include some of the most respected albums by [Devo](http://www.last.fm/music/Devo), [Talking Heads](http://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads), [U2](http://www.last.fm/music/U2), [Laurie Anderson](http://www.last.fm/music/Laurie+Anderson), [Paul Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon) and [Coldplay](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay).      Contrary to popular belief, Brian Eno did not produce [David Bowie](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie)’s popular Berlin Trilogy (_[Low](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/Low)_, _[Heroes](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/Heroes)_, and _[Lodger](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/Lodger)_). He performed and co- wrote tracks on all three albums, but they were produced by [Tony Visconti](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Visconti). He did, however, co-produce Bowie’s 1995 _[1\. Outside](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/1.+Outside)_. He also produced three of the [Talking Heads](http://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads) most acclaimed albums, _[More Songs About Buildings and Food](http://www.last
