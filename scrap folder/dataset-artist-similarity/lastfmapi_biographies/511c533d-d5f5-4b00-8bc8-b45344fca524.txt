When she’s not on the road or in the studio as a member of the [Indigo Girls](http://www.last.fm/music/Indigo+Girls), Amy Ray works on her own solo side project. In 2001, she released her first solo album, [Stag](http://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Ray/Stag). That year, she toured solo with [The Butchies](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Butchies) as her band. Then in 2005, her second solo project, [Prom](http://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Ray/Prom) was released. In December of 2006, Amy released [Live From Knoxville](http://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Ray/Live+From+Knoxville), a live recording from a show at Blue Cats in October of 2005. In August 2008 she released her latest album [Didn’t It Feel Kinder](http://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Ray/Didn%27t+It+Feel+Kinder), this is the first album she made with the help of a producer, Greg Griffith.      All three albums were released on Amy’s independent record label, [Daemon Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Daemon+Records).      Fans of the [Indigo Girls](http://www.last.fm/music/Indigo+Girls) can expect a rawer, punkier, and rockier sound.
