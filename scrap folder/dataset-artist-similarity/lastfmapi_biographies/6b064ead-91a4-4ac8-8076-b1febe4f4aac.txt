Alison Krauss (born July 23, 1971) is an American bluegrass-country singer, songwriter and fiddler. Signed to Rounder Records as a 14-year-old fiddler from Champaign, Illinois, she has become the most recognized face in contemporary bluegrass, a critically acclaimed artist who has brought modern sophistication to the genre while respecting its traditions. [Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=22526) reports that in 2011 Krauss recorded her first ever number one country album in her home country with [paper airplane](http://www.last.fm/music/Alison+Krauss/paper+airplane). She has also sold upwards of 11 million records and garnered 2 Oscar nominations as well as 26 Grammy® Awards, the most for any female artist in Grammy® history.      Also impressive is Krauss’s unwavering commitment to being an independent- label artist who has succeeded far beyond the scope of many major-label artists. She has circulated freely within pop, mainstream country and roots music circles, as a solo artist and with her long-time band Union Station, creating impeccably produced records that appeal to an equally wide-ranging and inquisitive audience. Krauss has continued doing things the old-fashioned way: following her heart and whatever path the music takes her on.
