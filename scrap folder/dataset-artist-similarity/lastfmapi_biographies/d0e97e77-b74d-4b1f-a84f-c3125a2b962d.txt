Spragga Benz (born Carlton Grant in Kingston, Jamaica on May 30, 1969), is one of Jamaica’s most famous Deejays. He began his career around 1991. Once known to his friends as Spaghetti (tall and slim) but later shortened to Spragga. The Benz in his name comes from the sound system for which he used to work for, L.a. Benz, and it is through this that he found his way into the music business at a Dubplate recording session with Buju Banton. The famed elder DJ was slated to do 4 tracks for L.a. Benz but only voiced two and suggested that Spragga do the other two. Since he was new to recording, he free-styled a couple of lines of what would then become Love Mi Gun, a popular tune.      He was the boyfriend of female rapper Foxy Brown.      Spragga played the character of Wayne in the movie ‘Shottas’, which was directed by Cess Silvera, and co-starred Ky-Mani Marley and Louie Rankin.
