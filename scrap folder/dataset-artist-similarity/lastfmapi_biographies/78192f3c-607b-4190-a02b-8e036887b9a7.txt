**Bear McCreary** (born on February 17, 1979) is a classically trained composer and musician living in Los Angeles, California. He studied under [Elmer Bernstein](http://www.last.fm/music/Elmer+Bernstein) and has composed original music for over thirty films including Jon Chu’s musical short _When the Kids are Away_.       Bear is perhaps most known for his work on the re-imagined television series _Battlestar Galactica_, for which he scored nearly all the music. He was introduced to the series as a helping hand to [Richard Gibbs](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Gibbs) while working on the _BSG_ miniseries, but he took over when Richard was occupied with other projects around the start of the first season.      Some of his other work includes the music to _Rest Stop: Dead Ahead_, _Wrong Turn 2_, _Rest Stop: Don’t Look Back_, and the television series _EUReKA_, _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_, _Human Target_, and _The Walking Dead_.         * \- [Official Website](http://www.bearmccreary.com)   * \- [Blog](http://www.bearmccreary.com/blog/)   * \- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/bearmccreary)   * \- [Internet Movie Database](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566970/)   *   * \- [Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/bearmccreary)   *
