Steve Morse’s career has encompassed rock, country, funk, jazz, classical, and fusion of these musical genres. In addition to a thriving solo career, has been (and continues to be) a member of several renowned bands.      Steve was born in Hamilton, Ohio, the son of a minister and a musically talented Mother. Both his Mother and Father were also educational psychologists.  The family soon moved to Tennessee and then Michigan, where the young Morse played in his first band (The Plague) with his older brother, Dave. The final move brought the family to Augusta, Georgia.      Steve’s parents enrolled Steve in the public school system. While at Richmond Academy. Steve met bassist [Andy West](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+West) in the 10th grade, forming a long-time musical bond. Together, they became the nucleus of Dixie Grit, adding keyboardist [Johnny Carr](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Carr), guitarist/vocalist Frank Brittingham, and drummer Dave Morse. The ambitious band played locally and a little in the Southeast for over a year, and then disbanded.      “At that point,” recalls Steve, “Andy and I were keen to keep on playing instrumental music on our own. So, since we were the only ones left from the group, or the dregs of the group, we called it Dixie Dregs.”      The University of Miami has played host to a number of future influential musicians, including [Bruce Hornsby](http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Hornsby), [Pat Metheny](http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Metheny), and [Jaco Pastorius](http://www.last.fm/music/Jaco+Pastorius). Even at the time, it had a reputation among budding musicians. Steve and Andy enrolled there, and were allowed to create a more rock oriented small group project to contrast the more jazz sounding ensembles that were available at the time. This ensemble appeared in the course schedule as Rock Ensemble II with Steve listed as the instructor. The other members were drummer Bart Yarnald, keyboardist [Frank Josephs](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Josephs) and violinist [Allen Sloan](http://www.last.fm/music/Allen+Sloan). Morse acted as the group’s writer, bringing attention to both his performing and composing.      Fellow student [Rod Morgenstein](http://www.last.fm/music/Rod+Morgenstein) became a fan of the group, later saying, “Steve stuck out like a sore thumb [laughs]. He had long blond hair, and he played a hybrid solid-body Fender Telecaster with a Stratocaster neck…he would change pickups as he was soloing, and his lines didn’t sound like stock bebop lines. But his teacher kept asking him, ‘Why can’t you sound like this [other] guy?’ Steve was just doing his own thing.”      Steve’s guitar, the Frankenstein Telecaster, was an attraction all to itself. Looking for more sonic variety than his stock Stratocaster, Steve started with a Telecaster body, and then added his familiar Stratocaster neck
