Stuart Townend is a British Christian worship leader and writer of hymns and worship songs. His output includes “In Christ Alone” (2002, cowritten with Keith Getty), “How Deep The Father’s Love”, “Beautiful Saviour” and “The King Of Love”.      In 2005, Cross Rhythms magazine described Townend as “one of the most significant songwriters in the whole international Christian music field”. Christian website Crosswalk.com commented that, “The uniqueness of Townend’s writing lies partly in its lyrical content. There is both a theological depth and poetic expression that some say is rare in today’s worship writing”.      Townend, son of a Church of England vicar in West Yorkshire, was the youngest of four children. He studied literature at the University of Essex[2]. Townend started learning to play the piano aged 7. At the age of 13, he made a Christian commitment, and began songwriting aged 22.
