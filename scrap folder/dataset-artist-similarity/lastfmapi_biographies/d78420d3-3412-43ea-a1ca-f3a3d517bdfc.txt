Billy Gilman (born William Wendell Gilman III May 24, 1988) is an American country music singer.      Born in Hope Valley, Rhode Island, with his parents Mr. & Mrs. William Gilman Jr., Gilman first received notice as a performer at age seven, attracting the attention of a local vocal coach, Angela Bacari, who later became his manager. Eventually he met with Ray Benson (of Asleep at the Wheel) who helped him record demos, including “Roly Poly”. Two months later he was signed by Sony Music Nashville.      His 2000 debut album, One Voice, had a very widely-played single that crossed over well into top 40 airplay. The album reached multi-platinum status, and earned a Grammy nomination. Generally touted as a child prodigy, Gilman appeared on various talk shows. Classic Christmas (which was certified gold) was released later in the year.      He released Dare to Dream (certified gold) on Sony BMG Music Entertainment/Epic Records in 2001, and in 2003 released Music Through Heartsongs, an album inspired by the poetry of Mattie Stepanek. Later in 2003, he performed at a benefit for The Station nightclub fire. In May 2005, he released Everything and More, his first album since his voice changed.      Billy’s latest album, self-titled, was released in September 2006 on the Image Entertainment label. The first single off the upcoming album, Southern Star, heralds a return to his country music roots. Billy is scheduled to begin working on his next album with Eddie Galan and Andrew Lane of Trilogy Productions.
