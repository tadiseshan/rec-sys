**Badly Drawn Boy** is an [independent](http://www.last.fm/tag/independent) musician, born Damon Gough October 2, 1969 in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, although the family returned to Bolton, Lancashire before Gough reached the age of one. Gough chose his stage name from a character that appeared in the cartoon show “Sam and His Magic Ball” which he saw on TV at a party in Trafford, Manchester in 1995. Before he thought of using this name he made some ‘business cards’, each one unique, with a printed picture of a drawing by his nephew, and a small collage by Gough. This was then laminated and given out to friends and people at clubs in Blackburn and Manchester.      His 2000 album _[The Hour of Bewilderbeast](http://www.last.fm/music/Badly+Dra wn+Boy/The+Hour+of+Bewilderbeast)_ won a prestigious Mercury Prize.
