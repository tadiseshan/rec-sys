Roy Harper (born 12 June 1941) is an English folk / rock singer-songwriter and guitarist who has been a professional musician since the mid 1960s. He has released a large catalogue of albums as an artist (22 studio albums and 12 live albums) and his influence has been acknowledged by many musicians including [Jimmy Page](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Page) and [Robert Plant](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Plant) of [Led Zeppelin](http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin) (who named the song “Hats Off to (Roy) Harper” after him), [Pink Floyd](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd) (who invited him to sing guest lead vocals on their song “Have a Cigar”), [Pete Townshend](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Townshend) of [The Who](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who), [Kate Bush](http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush), and [Ian Anderson](http://www.last.fm/music/Ian+Anderson) of [Jethro Tull](http://www.last.fm/music/Jethro+Tull), who is on record as saying that Harper has been his “primary influence as an acoustic guitarist and songwriter”.      Few survivors from the golden age of British folk-rock have kept their reputations intact. Of the generation of troubadours who came of age in the folk clubs of London in the mid-1960s, some have passed away, others have surrendered to the regurgitation of the blandest form of acoustic folk music. But among the survivors, there is one figure whose body of work, comprising 23 studio LPs and almost as many live and compilation releases, has come to stand for a particularly single-minded form of integrity. That man is Roy Harper.      Now officially ‘retired’, and living in a secluded corner of Ireland, Harper has recently been hailed as a key influence by a much younger generation of devoted starsailors who instinctively recognise his innovations, his refusal to compromise and his visionary world view. It is rumoured that Joanna Newsom insisted she’d only play her recent UK shows if he would support her. The likes of Fleet Foxes, Joanna Newsom, and Jim O’Rourke are avowed fans; and in previous decades he has enjoyed public endorsements and tributes from the likes of Led Zeppelin, Kate Bush, Pink Floyd’s Dave Gilmour and many more.      Biography      Born in 1941, Harper lost his mother within a few weeks of his birth and was brought up in the outskirts of Manchester by his father and stepmother, a Jehovah’s Witness. Harper developed a deep hatred of organised religion and ran away, aged 15, to join the Royal Air Force. The rigid discipline required did not suit him. In order to be discharged early he pleaded insanity and was committed to an institution where he received ECT. A former participant in the skiffle revolution in the mid-50s, around 1964 Harper found himself joining the stream of bohemian rambler-buskers hitching and singing their way around Europe and North Africa
