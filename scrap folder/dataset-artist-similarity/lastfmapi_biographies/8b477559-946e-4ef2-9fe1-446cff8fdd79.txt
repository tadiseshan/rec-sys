Her latest offering ‘Say It Again’, the third single to be taken from her critically acclaimed chart topping second album ‘N.B’, is no exception to this rule.

An uplifting song about falling for that elusive one, ‘Say It Again’ is reflective yet upbeat, and romantic without being saccharine sweet.      Natasha regularly contributes to YouTube as “uknatashabedingfield”.   Another song that has gotten international acclaim is pocketful of sunshine. DSTV has used it for promoting their station.
