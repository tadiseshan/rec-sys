CunninLynguists are a hip hop trio from Lexington, Kentucky and Atlanta, Georgia. The group currently consists of Deacon the Villain, Kno, and Natti. The name is a portmanteau of the words cunning and linguist, and is also a play on the word cunnilingus.      There has never been an anomaly in [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) quite like the southern trio CunninLynguists. Sampling genres from psych-rock to blues, New Romantic to polka, they have been musically compared to [UGK](http://www.last.fm/music/UGK) and [Atmosphere](http://www.last.fm/music/Atmosphere) in the same breath. They have toured and shared stages with [Kanye West](http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West) and [Aesop Rock](http://www.last.fm/music/Aesop+Rock) to equal success. They have produced for [Lil’ Scrappy](http://www.last.fm/music/Lil%27+Scrappy) as well as [KRS-One](http://www.last.fm/music/KRS-One). They have crafted songs with international soul superstar [Cee-Lo Green](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Cee-Lo+Green) and politically charged indie-favorite [Immortal Technique](http://www.last.fm/music/Immortal+Technique) … on the same album. CunninLynguists have eschewed categories, boxes and labels for 10 years, 5 albums and 4 official mixtapes, all while having what XXL Magazine described as the “Most Hated Name In Rap”.      The result? If you want labels…Southern boom-bap. Too white for BET, too black for MTV2. A preacher’s son, a caucasian guy from rural Georgia and a convicted felon. But mainly … a self-made career, one of the most consistent catalogs of any current hip-hop act and one of the most loyal, worldwide fanbases in all of [indie rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rap) music.      Backed with gritty beats, quality rhymes and 808 thump, the ‘Lynguists intend on recapturing the soul in southern hip-hop. With what Spin Magazine calls “Outkast’s tragicomic poignancy”, Deacon The Villain, Kno and Natti follow in the footsteps of artists like [Goodie Mob](http://www.last.fm/music/Goodie+Mob), Ya’ll So Stupid, [Geto Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/Geto+Boys) and the aforementioned ‘Kast in painting a picture meant to remind the world that politics, death, racism, relationships, religion and struggle are just as relevant to life below the Mason-Dixon as anywhere else.      Their critically acclaimed debut LP, Will Rap For Food, was released in October 2001. CunninLynguists were joined by Floridian emcee Mr. SOS for their 2nd LP, Southernunderground, which was independently released April 1, 2003 on Freshchest Records and QN5 Music and re-released in 2004. Guests included [Masta Ace](http://www.last.fm/music/Masta+Ace), [Tonedeff](http://www.last.fm/music/Tonedeff) and [RJD2](http://www.last.fm/music/RJD2). Between Southernunderground and A Piece of Strange, they released two mixtapes titled Sloppy Seconds Vol. 1 and Sloppy Seconds Vol. 2. Their third LP, A Piece of Strange, was released in January of 2006 via LAU Records
