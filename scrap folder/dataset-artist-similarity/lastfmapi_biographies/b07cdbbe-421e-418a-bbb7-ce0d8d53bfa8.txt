**Vic Chesnutt** (November 12, 1964 - December 25, 2009) was a [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) and [multi-instrumentalist](http://www.last.fm/tag/multi-instrumentalist) who lived in Athens, Georgia, United States.       Around 1985, Chesnutt moved to Athens and joined the band, The La-Di-Da’s.

In 1992 Chesnutt was the subject of a PBS documentary, Speed Racer. He also had a small role in the 1996 Billy Bob Thornton movie Sling Blade which he later described self-mockingly as a poor performance.      In 1996, Chesnutt was exposed to a wider audience with the release of the tribute album Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation, the proceeds from which went to the Sweet Relief Fund. The album consisted of Chesnutt covers by famous musicians including [Garbage](http://www.last.fm/music/Garbage), [The Smashing Pumpkins](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smashing+Pumpkins) (with [Red Red Meat](http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Red+Meat)), [Madonna](http://www.last.fm/music/Madonna), R.E.M. and [Live](http://www.last.fm/music/Live).
