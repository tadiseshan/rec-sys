**Keren Ann** (b. 1974) is a singer/songwriter with dual Dutch-Israeli citizenship. She plays guitar, piano, and clarinet, and engineers and writes choir and musical arrangements. She is of Russian-Jewish descent on her father’s side and Javanese-Dutch on her mother’s.      Born Keren Ann Zeidel in Caesarea, Israel on 10th March 1974, she lived in the Netherlands and Israel until the age of eleven, when her family moved to France. Her first group, [Kab](http://www.last.fm/music/Kab) (for Keren Ann Band), lasted three years. In 1997, she wrote the song “Father” for the film _K_ by Alexandre Arcady, in which she also acted a small part. The next year, at the age of twenty-four, she formed [Shelby](http://www.last.fm/music/Shelby) with two other women; the group released one album and had a small success with the song “1+1+1”, whose composer [Benjamin Biolay](http://www.last.fm/music/Benjamin+Biolay) became an important collaborator. In 2000 she began her solo career with _La biographie de Luka Philipsen_ — “Luka” in homage to the [Suzanne Vega](http://www.last.fm/music/Suzanne+Vega) song, “Philipsen” after her maternal grandmother — written with and produced by Biolay, who also co-wrote and -produced its follow-up, _La disparition_. (In return, she helped write his debut album, _Rose Kennedy_.) The pair also wrote several songs for [Henri Salvador](http://www.last.fm/music/Henri+Salvador)’s best-selling, prize- winning 2000 comeback album, _Chambre avec vue_.      [Lady & Bird](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+&+Bird) is a collaboration with [Bardi Johannsson](http://www.last.fm/music/Bardi+Johannsson) of the Icelandic group [Bang Gang](http://www.last.fm/music/Bang+Gang).      _Not Going Anywhere_, which includes several songs from _La disparition_ re- sung in English, was her first U.S. release, but her American breakthrough came with its follow-up, _Nolita_. Recorded in Paris and New York, it is named for Nolita, her neighborhood in lower Manhattan; it is sung half in French and half in English.
