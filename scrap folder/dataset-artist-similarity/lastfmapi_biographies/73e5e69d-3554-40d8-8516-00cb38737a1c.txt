Robyn Rihanna Fenty (born February 20, 1988), known by her stage name, Rihanna, is a Bajan singer. Her song [Umbrella](http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Umbrella) was one of the highest-selling songs of 2007 and her 3rd album [Good Girl Gone Bad](http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/Good+Girl+Gone+Bad) was critically acclaimed, helping propel her to superstar status. She has attained thirteen Billboard Hot 100 number ones thus far and is the second Bajan artist to win a Grammy Award. She is also a cultural ambassador for Barbados.      Rihanna was born in Saint Michael, Barbados to Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor, and Monica Fenty, an accountant. Her mother, a native of Guyana, is Afro-Guyanese and her father is Bajan and Irish. She is the oldest of three siblings; two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty. She began singing at around the age of seven. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father’s addiction to crack cocaine and parent’s rocky marriage, which ended when she was fourteen years old. Rihanna attended Charles F. Broome Memorial School, a primary school in Barbados, and then the Combermere School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates at the age of fifteen. In 2004 she won the Miss Combermere Beauty Pageant. She was an army cadet in a sub-military programme that trained with the military of Barbados and Shontelle was her drill sergeant.      At the age of 15, she formed a girl group with two of her classmates. In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing in Barbados with his wife. The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that “the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn’t exist.” While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang Destiny’s Child’s cover of “Emotion”. Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with Rogers and his wife. Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad “[The Last Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/The+Last+Time),” a cover of [Whitney Houston](http://www.last.fm/music/Whitney+Houston)’s hit “[For the Love of You](http://www.last.fm/music/Whitney+Houston/_/For+the+Love+of+You)” and what would become her first hit, “[Pon de Replay](http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Pon+de+Replay)” to send to various recording companies. It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna’s demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her to audition for the label’s then-president, [Jay-Z](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay-Z), who quickly signed her.      Rihanna broke into the recording industry in 2005 with the release of her debut album [Music of the Sun](http://www.last
