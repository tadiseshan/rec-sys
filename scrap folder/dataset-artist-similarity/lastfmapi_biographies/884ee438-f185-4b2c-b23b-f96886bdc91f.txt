Trevor Charles Rabin (b. January 13, 1954) is South African-born American musician best known as a guitarist and songwriter for the British progressive rock band [Yes](http://www.last.fm/music/Yes) from 1983 - 1995, and since then, as a film composer.      Rabin comes from a family of classical musicians in Johannesburg, South Africa, where his father was lead violinist for the Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra. Educated at a public school in Johannesburg, he took formal piano training before discovering the guitar at age 12. His parents encouraged his talents toward rock music, although Rabin would maintain his interest in Classical music throughout his career. Rabin also briefly studied orchestration at the University of Johannesburg, and later arranged and conducted for many artists in South Africa.      Trevor Rabin’s early influences included [Arnold Schoenberg](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Arnold+Schoenberg), [Tchaikovsky](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Tchaikovsky), [Cliff Richard And The Shadows](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Cliff+Richard+And+The+Shadows), [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles) and [Jimi Hendrix](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix). He also dabbled with progressive and heavy rock with his first bands, The Conglomeration and [Freedom’s Children](http://www.last.fm/music/Freedom%27s+Children). The latter group were older musicians whose songs questioned the South African government, especially its racial policy of apartheid. During this same period, Rabin became a highly sought after session guitarist and bassist, playing with many jazz bands in South Africa. When Rabin fulfilled his obligation to the South African Army at age 19, he served with the entertainment division.      In 1974 Trevor Rabin formed his first major recording group, [Rabbitt](http://www.last.fm/music/Rabbitt) along with Neil Cloud (drums), Ronnie Robot (bass guitar) and Duncan Faure (keyboards, guitar, vocals). [Rabbitt](http://www.last.fm/music/Rabbitt) actually began just prior to Rabin’s year of military conscription in 1974, but it really took off in 1975 after their onstage popularity at Johannesburg’s “Take It Easy” club spread by word of mouth. Their first single, released in 1975, was a cover of [Jethro Tull](http://www.last.fm/music/Jethro+Tull)’s _”Locomotive Breath”_. It later appeared on their debut album, _Boys Will Be Boys_, which featured original songs penned by Trevor Rabin.      [Rabbitt](http://www.last.fm/music/Rabbitt)’s second album, _A Croak and a Grunt in the Night_, was released in 1977. Trevor Rabin would go on to win a South African music award for his co-production on the album. Momentum gained with a short-term record distribution deal with Capricorn in the United States, but [Rabbitt](http://www.last.fm/music/Rabbitt) were unable to tour abroad because of continuing international disapproval of South Africa’s apartheid policies
