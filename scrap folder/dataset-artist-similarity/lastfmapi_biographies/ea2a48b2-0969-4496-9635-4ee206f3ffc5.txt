**Eddi Reader** MBE (born 28 August 1959) is a Scottish singer, known both for her work with [Fairground Attraction](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction) and for an enduring solo career, which in 2003 saw her showcase the works of Scotland’s national poet, Robert Burns.      Reader was born in Glasgow, the daughter of a welder, and the eldest of seven children (her brother, Francis, is vocalist with the band [The Trash Can Sinatras](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Trash+Can+Sinatras)). She began playing the guitar at the age of ten, and started her musical career busking, first in Glasgow’s Sauchiehall Street, then in the early 1980s around Europe (where she also worked with circus and performance artists).      Back in Scotland, she joined the punk band [Gang of Four](http://www.last.fm/music/Gang+of+Four) as a backing singer which led to her first US tour. After leaving the band she started working as a session vocalist in London, singing with such acts as [Eurythmics](http://www.last.fm/music/Eurythmics), [Alison Moyet](http://www.last.fm/music/Alison+Moyet) and [Language](http://www.last.fm/music/Language).      In 1984, Reader sang for a brief time with disco group Outbar Squeek. Around the same time she teamed up with [Mark E. Nevin](http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+E.+Nevin), a guitarist and songwriter, to record a few of his songs. They subsequently formed [Fairground Attraction](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction), together with [Simon Edwards](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Edwards) and [Roy Dodds](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Dodds). In 1988 the band released their first single, [Perfect](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction/_/Perfect), which became a UK number one, winning best single at the 1989 Brit Awards. Their first album, [The First Of A Million Kisses](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairgrou nd+Attraction/The+First+Of+A+Million+Kisses), was also a success, reaching number two in the UK album chart, and winning best album at the 1989 Brit Awards.      This success was short-lived, however. In November, 1989, after a break, during which Reader had her first child, Charlie with her French-Algerian partner Milou, Mark Nevin abandoned a recording session for the second album, which would eventually lead to the splitting of the band. A makeshift second album, a collection of B-sides and live tracks, [Ay Fond Kiss](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction/Ay+Fond+Kiss) was rushed out the following year.      Reader returned to Scotland, but before she embarked on her solo career she took a temporary detour into acting. She played Jolene Jowett, a singer and accordionist, in John Byrne’s Your Cheatin’ Heart, a comedy-drama series for BBC television, set in the country music scene in Scotland.      Returning to London, Reader worked on new material with a backing band calling itself “The Patron Saints of Imperfection” (made up of Roy Dodds, Neill and Calum MacColl, and Phil Steriopoulos)
