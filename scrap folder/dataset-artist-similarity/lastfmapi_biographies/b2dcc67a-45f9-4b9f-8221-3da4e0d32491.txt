Albert Ayler (born July 13th, 1936 in Cleveland Heights, Ohio – New York City, November 1970) was the most primal of the [free jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/free%20jazz) musicians of the 1960s. He possessed a deep blistering tone—achieved by using the stiffest plastic reeds he could find on his [tenor saxophone](http://www.last.fm/tag/tenor%20saxophone)—and a broad, pathos-filled vibrato that came right out of church music. His trio and quartet records of 1964, like ‘[Spiritual Unity](http://www.last.fm/music/Albert+Ayler/Spiritual+Unity)’ and ‘[The Hilversum Sessions](http://www.last.fm/music/Albert+Ayler/The+Hilversum+Sessions)’, show him advancing the improvisational notions of [John Coltrane](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane) and [Ornette Coleman](http://www.last.fm/music/Ornette+Coleman) into abstract realms where timbre, not harmony and melody, is the music’s backbone. His ecstatic music of 1965 and 1966, like “[Spirits Rejoice](http://www.last.fm/music/Albert+Ayler/_/Spirits+Rejoice)” and “[Truth Is Marching In](http://www.last.fm/music/Albert+Ayler/_/Truth+Is+Marching+In)” has been compared by critics to the sound of a Salvation Army brass band, and involved simple, march-like themes which alternated with wild group improvisations and took [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) back to its pre-[Louis Armstrong](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Armstrong) roots.      Ayler remains something of a cult artist. “[Ghosts](http://www.last.fm/music/Albert+Ayler/_/Ghosts)”—with its bouncy, sing-song melody (rather reminiscent of a [nursery rhyme](http://www.last.fm/tag/nursery%20rhyme))—is probably his best known tune, and is something of a free jazz standard, having been covered by [Lester Bowie](http://www.last.fm/music/Lester+Bowie), [Gary Windo](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Windo), [Eugene Chadbourne](http://www.last.fm/music/Eugene+Chadbourne), [Joe McPhee](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+McPhee), [John Tchicai](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Tchicai) and [Ken Vandermark](http://www.last.fm/music/Ken+Vandermark), among others.      Saxophonist [Mars Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Mars+Williams) led a group called [Witches and Devils](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Witches+and+Devils), which was not only named after an Ayler song, but which covered several of his songs.      [Peter Brötzmann](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Br%C3%B6tzmann)’s [Die Like a Dog Quartet](http://www.last.fm/music/Die+Like+a+Dog+Quartet) is a group loosely dedicated to Ayler. A record called ‘[Little Birds Have Fast Hearts](h ttp://www.last.fm/music/Die+Like+A+Dog+Quartet/Little+Birds+Have+Fast+Hearts)’ references Ayler’s youthful nickname.      In 2005, guitarist [Marc Ribot](http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Ribot) (who has occasionally performed Ayler’s songs for some years) released an album dedicated to the ethic of collective improvisation, entitled ‘[Spiritual Unity](http://www.last
