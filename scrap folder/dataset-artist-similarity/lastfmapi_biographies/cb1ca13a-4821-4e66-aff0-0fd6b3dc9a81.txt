Kris Kristofferson (born 22 June 1936 in Brownsville, Texas, United States) is a singer/songwriter and actor. He is known for such hits as “Me and Bobby McGee”, “For the Good Times”, “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down”, and “Help Me Make It Through the Night”. Kristofferson is the sole writer of most of his songs, and he has collaborated with various other figures of the Nashville scene such as [Shel Silverstein](http://www.last.fm/music/Shel+Silverstein). In 1985, Kristofferson joined fellow country artists [Waylon Jennings](http://www.last.fm/music/Waylon+Jennings), [Willie Nelson](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson) and [Johnny Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash) in forming the country music supergroup [The Highwaymen](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Highwaymen). In 2004 Kristofferson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.      Kristoffer Kristofferson was born in Brownsville, Texas, to Mary Ann (née Ashbrook) and Lars Henry Kristofferson, a U.S. Army Air Corps officer (later a U.S. Air Force Major General). His paternal grandparents immigrated from Sweden, and Kristofferson’s paternal grandfather was an officer in the Swedish Army. When Kristoffer was a child, his father pushed him toward a military career. Like most “military brats”, Kristofferson moved around frequently as a youth, finally settling down in San Mateo, California, where he graduated from San Mateo High School. An aspiring writer, Kristofferson enrolled in Pomona College in 1954. He experienced his first dose of fame when he appeared in Sports Illustrated’s “Faces in the Crowd” for his achievements in collegiate rugby union, football, and track and field. He and fellow classmates revived the Claremont Colleges Rugby Club in 1958, which has remained a Southern California rugby dynasty.[clarification needed] Kris became a member of Kappa Delta at Pomona College, graduating in 1958 with a BA, summa cum laude in Literature. In a 2004 interview with Pomona College Magazine Kristofferson mentioned philosophy professor Frederick Sontag as an important influence in his life.      After leaving the Army in 1965, Kristofferson moved to Nashville. He worked at a variety of odd jobs while struggling for success in music, burdened with medical expenses resulting from his son’s defective esophagus. He and his wife soon divorced.      He got a job sweeping floors at Columbia Studios in Nashville. There he met Johnny Cash, who initially accepted some of Kristofferson’s songs but chose not to use them. During Kristofferson’s janitorial stint for Columbia, Bob Dylan recorded his landmark 1966 album Blonde on Blonde at the studio. Though he had the opportunity to watch some of Dylan’s recording sessions, Kristofferson never met Dylan out of fear that he would be fired for approaching him.      He also worked as a commercial helicopter pilot at that time for a south Louisiana firm called Petroleum Helicopters International (PHI), based in Lafayette, Louisiana
