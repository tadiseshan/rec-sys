Curtis Mayfield (June 3, 1942 – December 26, 1999) was an American [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul), [funk](http://www.last.fm/tag/funk) and [rhythm and blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/rhythm%20and%20blues), [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) and guitarist from Chicago, Illinois.      Mayfield is probably best known for his anthemic music with [The Impressions](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Impressions) and for the soundtrack to the [blaxploitation](http://www.last.fm/tag/blaxploitation) film Superfly.      Perhaps because he didn’t cross over to the pop audience as heavily as Motown’s stars, it may be that the scope of Curtis Mayfield’s talents and contributions have yet to be fully recognized. Judged merely by his records alone, the man’s legacy is enormous. As the leader of the Impressions, he recorded some of the finest soul vocal group music of the 1960s. As a solo artist in the 1970s, he helped pioneer funk and helped introduce hard-hitting urban commentary into soul music. “Gypsy Woman,” “It’s All Right,” “People Get Ready,” “Freddie’s Dead,” and “Superfly” are merely the most famous of his many hit records.      But Curtis Mayfield wasn’t just a singer. Born in in Chicago, IL, he wrote most of his material at a time when that was not the norm for soul performers. He was among the first — if not the very first — to speak openly about African-American pride and community struggle in his compositions. As a songwriter and a producer, he was a key architect of [chicago soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/chicago%20soul), penning material and working on sessions by notable Windy City soulsters like Gene Chandler, Jerry Butler, Major Lance, and Billy Butler. In this sense, he can be compared to Smokey Robinson, who also managed to find time to write and produce many classics for other soul stars. Mayfield was also an excellent guitarist, and his rolling, Latin-influenced lines were highlights of the Impressions’ recordings in the ’60s. During the next decade, he would toughen up his guitar work and production, incorporating some of the best features of psychedelic rock and funk.      Mayfield began his career as an associate of Jerry Butler, with whom he formed the Impressions in the late ’50s. After the Impressions had a big hit in 1958 with “For Your Precious Love,” Butler, who had sung lead on the record, split to start a solo career. Mayfield, while keeping the Impressions together, continued to write for and tour with Butler before the Impressions got their first Top 20 hit in 1961, “Gypsy Woman.”      Mayfield was heavily steeped in gospel music before he entered the pop arena, and gospel, as well as doo wop, influences would figure prominently in most of his ’60s work. Mayfield wasn’t a staunch traditionalist, however
