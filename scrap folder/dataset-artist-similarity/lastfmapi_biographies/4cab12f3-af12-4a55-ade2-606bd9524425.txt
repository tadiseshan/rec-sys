**Dannii Minogue** (born October 20, 1971, Melbourne, Australia) first tasted fame on the Oz TV show ‘Young Talent Time’ as well as playing the role of Emma in ‘Home & Away’. In 1990, her debut single, [Love and Kisses](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/_/Love+and+Kisses) made the top ten in Australia, and in the UK in 1991. She has since achieved a record thirteen consecutive #1 UK Club hits.      Dannii first broke out of her sister’s shadow in 1997 with the album _[Girl](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/Girl)_. Whilst [Kylie Minogue](http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue) was experimenting with dark lyrics, indie collaborations and moody images (_[Impossible Princess](http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue/Impossible+Princess)_), Dannii went out and out for the dancefloor with the huge hit [All I Wanna Do](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/_/All+I+Wanna+Do). Unfortunately, the album that it was from only reached No. 57. However, Dannii herself has said, “This was a big turning point for me. It has led me on to the album _[Neon Nights](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/Neon+Nights)_ and my collaborations with many club DJs and remixers”.      2001 was a success for Dannii, when her vocals were part of [Riva](http://www.last.fm/music/Riva)’s _Who Do You Love Now?_, which laid the foundations for her fourth album _[Neon Nights](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/Neon+Nights)_ released in March 2003.      Moving to London Records, Dannii made more credible dance tracks including [I Begin To Wonder](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/_/I+Begin+To+Wonder) and [Put the Needle on It](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/_/Put+the+Needle+on+It). In 2003, Dannii released her fourth album, _[Neon Nights](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/Neon+Nights)_. It was a surprise chart success, reaching no.8 in the UK charts and eventually achieving gold status, selling over 100,000 copies. The album also made gold certification in Australia. Dannii also teamed up with chill-out Ibiza stars [Afterlife](http://www.last.fm/music/Afterlife) for a collaboration on their _[Speck Of Gold](http://www.last.fm/music/Afterlife/Speck+Of+Gold)_ album. Dannii’s star was beginning to shine in its own right.      In 2004, after a top 10 album and four top 10 singles, Dannii moved to [All Around The World](http://www.last.fm/label/All+Around+The+World) Records. Her first single for AATW was [You Won’t Forget About Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/_/You+Won%27t+Forget+About+Me), which saw Dannii’s vocals layered on top of the instrumental hit _Flower Power_ and landed at no.7 in the UK charts, making it Dannii’s fifth consecutive top 10 hit. [You Won’t Forget About Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/_/You+Won%27t+Forget+About+Me) was followed up in 2005 by [Perfection](http://www.last.fm/music/Dannii+Minogue/_/Perfection), on which Dannii teamed up with the [Soul Seekerz](http://www.last
