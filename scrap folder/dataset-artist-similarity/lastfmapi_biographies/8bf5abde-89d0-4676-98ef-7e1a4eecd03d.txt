**Ralph McTell** is an English singer/songwriter and acoustic guitar player who has been an influential figure on the UK folk scene since the 1960s.   Ralph McTell is probably best known for the song Streets of London which has been covered by over a hundred artists around the world. From Clare to Here has proved almost as popular, during a long and continuing recording and performing career.   McTell’s guitar style has been influenced by many of the USA’s country blues ‘Piedmont- style’ guitar players of the early 20th century, including Blind Blake and Blind Willie McTell, from whom he took his name.
