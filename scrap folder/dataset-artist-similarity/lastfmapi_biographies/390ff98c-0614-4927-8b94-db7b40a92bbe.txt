Antonio Pecci Filho (born in São Paulo, Brazil on July 6, 1946), originally nicknamed “Toquinho” by his mother, is a Brazilian singer and guitarist. He is well-known for his collaborations, as composer and performer, with [Vinícius de Moraes](http://www.last.fm/music/Vin%C3%ADcius+de+Moraes). He began his guitar studies at the age of 14 with Paulinho Nogueira and went on to study harmony with Edgar Janulo, classical guitar with Isaias Sávio and orchestration with Léo Peracchi. He also studied with and befriended Oscar Castro-Neves.      Initially playing in colleges, Toquinho’s professional career took off in the 1960s at shows promoted by radio personality Walter Silva at the famous Paramount theater in São Paulo. He composed his first recorded song with Chico Buarque entitled “Lua Cheia” (Full Moon). His first big hit was composed in 1970 with Jorge Benjor, “Que Maravilha” (What a Wonder). That same year he was invited by Vinícius de Moraes, co-writer of the worldwide hit song “Garota de Ipanema” (The Girl from Ipanema), to participate in a series of shows in Buenos Aires, forming a solid partnership that would continue for 11 years and produce 120 songs, 25 records and over a thousand shows.      After the death of Vinícius de Moraes in 1980, he went on to pursue a solo career, often performing with other talented musicians like [Paulinho Da Viola](http://www.last.fm/music/Paulinho+Da+Viola), [Danilo Caymmi](http://www.last.fm/music/Danilo+Caymmi), [Paulinho Nogueira](http://www.last.fm/music/Paulinho+Nogueira) and [Chico Buarque](http://www.last.fm/music/Chico+Buarque).
