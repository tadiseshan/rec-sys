Stina Nordenstam (born Kristina Ulrika Nordenstam on 4 March 1969 in Stockholm, Sweden) is a Swedish singer, songwriter and musician.      In 1991, the year she released her first album _Memories of a Colour_, Nordenstam played at the Swedish parliament as part of the Year of Jazz. Her early work, including her second album, _And She Closed Her Eyes_, released in 1994, was significantly jazz-influenced, with only subtle elements of alternative rock. With 1997’s _Dynamite_ she started down a darker, more experimental path; most of the album was filled with processed, distorted electric guitars and unusual beats, but careful listening revealed her unique song-writing abilities.      An album of covers, _People Are Strange_, followed before she returned in 2001 with _This Is Stina Nordenstam_, an album with shorter songs and a more pop- like feel; ex-[Suede](http://www.last.fm/music/Suede) vocalist [Brett Anderson](http://www.last.fm/music/Brett+Anderson) featured on two tracks. In 2003 Nordenstam appeared in a duet with [Jonas Bjerre](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonas+Bjerre) from [Mew](http://www.last.fm/music/Mew) on Mew’s third album _Frengers_, with a song called “Her Voice Is beyond Her Years”. Between 2003 and 2004 she made the Swedish radio-theatre series called _The Fears of the Ice_, about one of the first polar expeditions.      Her 2004 album, _The World Is Saved_, continues the path set on _This Is…_, but presents a more realised sound and acknowledges her earlier jazz influences more.      In addition to being a musician, Nordenstam also works in other fields, such as photography and music-video directing.      Slightly reclusive, she gives very few interviews, rarely performs live and even alters her appearance using wigs and make-up for album covers and magazines. During the promotion for _The World Is Saved_, however, she gave more interviews than usual, and even talked about the possibility of future live performances.      In 2006, Nordenstam appeared on _Snow Borne Sorrow_, an album by the band [Nine Horses](http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Horses), singing duets with the band’s vocalist, [David Sylvian](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Sylvian).
