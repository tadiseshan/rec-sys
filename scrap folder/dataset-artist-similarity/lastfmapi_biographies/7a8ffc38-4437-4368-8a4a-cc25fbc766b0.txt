One of the defining elements of the Diplomats’ music is the innovative slang they have incorporated into their lyrics. The broader hip-hop community has accepted and utilized many of their terms, including “doggie,”, “no homo”, “piff,” “huff,” “u mad?”, “move the movement”, “off’ wit’ Ya’ Kufi Smacker”, “goonies goo goo,”, “duck tales”, “family matters”, and “coochie rap”. They also coined the greeting, “What’s Really Good?”. Many of the rappers were signed, and were premiered in mixtapes, but the Diplomats did not become exclusive until 2003 with their cd Diplomatic Immunity. In previous music videos when Cam’ron was starting his career you could see fellow diplomats like Jim Jones or Freeky Zeeky. The Diplomats have also gained notable street credability through their mixtapes, especially in New York, and have made a small fortune through mixtape sales. They also have their own brand of Liquor, Sizzurp.      2) The Dilpomats were a mid-90’s pop band from Roanoke, Virginia Heavily influenced by Big Star.      3) The Diplomats is also an avant jazz project consisting of:   Rob Brown (as)   Steve Swell (tb)   Harris Eisenstadt (d)
