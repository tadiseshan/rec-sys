Nikhil Banerjee (Bangla: নিখিল ব্যানার্জী) (14 October 1931–27 January 1986) was one of India’s most prominent sitar players of the second half of the 20th Century. He never achieved the glamour of [Vilayat Khan](http://www.last.fm/music/Vilayat+Khan) or his gurubhai [Ravi Shankar](http://www.last.fm/music/Ravi+Shankar), but Nikhil Banerjee did win great critical acclaim and the hearts of many music lovers. He is remembered as a musician’s musician.      Along with Ravi Shankar, [Vasant Rai](http://www.last.fm/music/Vasant+Rai), and [Ali Akbar Khan](http://www.last.fm/music/Ali+Akbar+Khan), he was trained by “Baba” [Ustad Allauddin Khan](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ustad+Allauddin+Khan) of the Maihar gharana (school).      Beginnings      Nikhil Banerjee was born in Calcutta into a Brahmin family, where music as a profession was discouraged, although his father, Jitendranath Banerjee, an amateur sitariya, taught him to play the instrument. Young Nikhil grew into a child prodigy, won an All-Bengal Sitar Competition at the age of 9 and soon was playing for All India Radio. At the time, his sister was a student of khyal great Amir Khan, who became a life-long influence. Jitendranath approached Mushtaq Ali Khan to take the boy as a disciple, but was turned down; instead Birendra Kishore Roy Chowdhury, the zamindar of Gouripur in present-day Bangladesh, was responsible for much of Nikhil’s early training.      In 1947 Banerjee met Allauddin Khan, who was to become his main guru. Allauddin played the sarod; Banerjee went to his concerts and followed him around, and in the end even went so far as to threaten to kill himself if he was not accepted as a disciple. Allauddin did not want to take on more students, but changed his mind after listening to one of Banerjee’s radio broadcasts.      Maihar gharana      The discipline under Allauddin Khan was legendary. For years, Nikhil’s practice would start at four in the morning, and with few breaks continue to eleven o’clock – at night[1] – a schedule which was naturally hard on his fingers. Among others, Allauddin also taught his son, Ali Akbar Khan, on the sarod; Ravi Shankar on the sitar; his daugther, Annapurna Devi on the surbahar, and Pannalal Ghosh on the flute.      Obviously, what Allauddin was passing on to most of his students was not playing technique but the musical knowledge and approach of the Maihar gharana (school); yet there was a definite trend in his teaching to infuse the sitar and sarod with the been-baj aesthetic of the Rudra veena, surbahar and sursringar – long, elaborate alap (unaccompanied improvisation) built on intricate meend work (bending of the note). Under his teaching, Shankar and Banerjee developed different sitar styles[2] [3], but to the uninitiated, Banerjee will sound like Ravi Shankar, similar but with a less buzzing sound. They played similar sitars, both with bass strings
