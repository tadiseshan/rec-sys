The Wailin’ Jennys is a Canadian folk music trio originating in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Their name is a pun on country singer [Waylon Jennings](http://www.last.fm/music/Waylon+Jennings). Since forming in 2002 when a local music shop brought together three solo acts for a performance, the trio has released a series of albums, two of which have won [Juno Awards](http://junoawards.ca), Canada’s top music industry award. Their album “40 Days” won the “Roots and Traditional Album of the Year by a Group” in 2005, as did their album “Bright Morning Stars” in 2012. They were also nominated for the same award in 2007 for “Firecracker”. Over the years, the group has featured regularly on [Garrison Keillor](http://www.last.fm/music/Garrison+Keillor)’s live radio variety show “A Prairie Home Companion”.      Three extraordinary voices, two founding singer-songwriters, one singular vision: The Wailin’ Jennys continue to evolve into far more than the melodious sum of their individual talents years after blowing in on a fresh acoustic breeze from Canada’s mid-western heartland.      Spurred onward by a growing fan base that swoons at their intuitive harmonies and revels in their engaging stage presence and uplifting repertoire, the Jennys embarked on a giddy blur of activity following the release of their second album, Firecracker, in August, 2006. Numerous head-turning reviews (“quiet, warm, subtle, mellifluous, almost too good to be true,” noted British daily The Independent) greeted a recording produced by David Travers-Smith ([Jane Siberry](http://www.last.fm/music/Jane+Siberry), [Harry Manx](http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Manx)) and featuring a crew of ace musicians led by guitarist Kevin Breit ([Norah Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Norah+Jones), [k.d. lang](http://www.last.fm/music/k.d.+lang)). The trio wooed progressively larger audiences throughout North America while also making successful forays to Australia, the U.K. and continental Europe.      Foremost among a series of uplifting life moments have been a second Juno Award, the continuation of a much-cherished relationship with A Prairie Home Companion ([Garrison Keillor](http://www.last.fm/music/Garrison+Keillor)’s popular National Public Radio show) and a memorable date alongside [Rosanne Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash) at the prestigious Celtic Connections festival in Glasgow.      “One Voice,” a live staple and highlight of the Jennys’ Juno- winning debut album 40 Days, remains a metaphoric statement of intent that to this day underlines the group’s original mandate: three individuals with unique gifts combining seamlessly into a single beatific entity. Soprano [Ruth Moody](http://www.last.fm/music/Ruth+Moody) (guitar, banjo, accordion, bodhran) and mezzo [Nicky Mehta](http://www.last.fm/music/Nicky+Mehta) (guitar, harmonica, ukulele, percussion) are charter members who’ve anchored the Jennys since the first line-up formed in their Winnipeg hometown
