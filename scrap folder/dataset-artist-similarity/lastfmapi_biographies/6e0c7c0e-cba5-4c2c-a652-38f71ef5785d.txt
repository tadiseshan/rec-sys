She is the daughter of [Keith Allen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Allen_%28actor%29) and film producer [Alison Owen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Owen). Allen left school when she was 15 and concentrated on improving her performing and compositional skills. She started her musical career in 2002 by signing to [London Records](http://www.last.fm/label/London+Records). In 2005, she made some of her recordings public on [Myspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) and the publicity resulted in airplay on [BBC Radio 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_1) and a contract with [Regal Recordings](http://www.last.fm/label/Regal+Recordings).      Her first mainstream single, “[Smile](http://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Allen/_/Smile)”, reached number one on the [UK Singles Chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart) in July 2006. Her debut record, [Alright, Still](http://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Allen/Alright,+Still), was well received, selling over 2.6 million copies worldwide and brought Allen a nomination at the [Grammy Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards), [BRIT Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIT_Awards) and [MTV Video Music Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Awards). She began hosting her own talk-show, [Lily Allen and Friends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Allen_and_Friends), on [BBC Three](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Three).      Her second studio album, [It’s Not Me, It’s You](http://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Allen/It%27s+Not+Me,+It%27s+You), saw a genre shift, having more of an [electropop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electropop) feel, rather than the [ska](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska) and [reggae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae) influences of the first one. The album debuted at number one on the [UK Albums Chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Albums_Chart) and the [Australian ARIA Charts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARIA_Charts) and was well received by critics, noting the singer’s musical evolution and maturity. It spawned the hit singles “[The Fear](http://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Allen/_/The+Fear)” and “[Fuck You](http://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Allen/_/Fuck+You)”, popular mostly in Europe. Allen and [Amy Winehouse](http://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Winehouse) have been credited with starting a process that led to the media-proclaimed “year of the women” in 2009 that saw five female artists making music of “experimentalism and fearlessness” nominated for the [Mercury Prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Prize).
