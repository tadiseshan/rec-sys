American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) Dar Williams lives at the intersection of [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) and [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk). She fuses many genres (blues, rock, jazz), resulting in a rather organic sound. She has been making music for over a decade.      Her studio album [My Better Self](http://www.last.fm/music/Dar+Williams/My+Better+Self) finds Dar at an unequivocally brazen crossroads. Reflecting on American politics, the disillusionment and apathy of youth, and the female experience, Dar makes no apology for her outspoken beliefs.      Her 2008 album, entitled [Promised Land](http://www.last.fm/music/Dar+Williams/Promised+Land). indieduck.com notes that “Williams turns over relationships in all their misunderstood, misconnected glory, and embraces religion, gender and other complications in her very wise songs. Promised Land draws in themes of nature, as well, and on the whole is a pretty piece of work that ends up feeling upbeat despite itself.”      Her most recent album, 2012’s [In The Time of the Gods](http://www.last.fm/music/Dar+Williams/In+The+Time+of+the+Gods), has a theme of Greek mythology running through it. The [You Will Ride With Me Tonight Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=25899) reports that Williams got the idea whilst driving on an isolated highway, during a trip from New York to Ontario.
