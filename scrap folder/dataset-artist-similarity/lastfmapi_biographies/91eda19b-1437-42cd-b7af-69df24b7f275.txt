Jacques Brel (8 April 1929 – 9 October 1978) was a Belgian singer and songwriter who composed and performed literate, thoughtful, and theatrical songs that generated a large, devoted following in Belgium and France initially, and later throughout the world. He was widely considered a master of the modern chanson. Although he recorded most of his songs in French, he became a major influence on English-speaking songwriters and performers such as David Bowie, Alex Harvey, Leonard Cohen, Marc Almond and Rod McKuen. English translations of his songs were recorded by many top performers in the United States, including Ray Charles, Judy Collins, John Denver, the Kingston Trio, Nina Simone, Frank Sinatra, Scott Walker, and Andy Williams. In French- speaking countries, Brel was also a successful actor, appearing in ten films. He also directed two films, one of which, Le Far West, was nominated for the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973. Jacques Brel has sold over 25 million records worldwide, and is the third best-selling Belgian recording artist of all time.      Brel was born on 8th April 1929 in Schaarbeek, a district of Brussels, and lived half of his life in Paris. He died of lung cancer on 9th October 1978 in Bobigny in the suburbs of Paris, and is buried in the Marquesas Islands.      Although the Brels spoke French, they were of Flemish descent, with some of the family originating from Zandvoorde, near Ieper. Brel’s father was co-owner of a cardboard factory and Brel started his professional life at that firm, apparently destined to follow in his father’s footsteps. However he had no interest in it, showing instead an interest in the arts, having joined the Catholic-humanist youth organisation Franche Cordée, where he did some singing and acting. At Franche Cordée he met Thérèse Michielsen (‘Miche’), and they married in 1950.      In the early 1950s Brel achieved some minor success in Belgium, singing his own songs. A 78rpm record (“La foire”/”Il y a”) was released as a result. From 1954 Brel seriously pursued a singing career. He quit his job and moved to Paris, writing music and singing in the city’s cabarets and music-halls… In January 1955 he supported in the [ancienne belgique](http://www.last.fm/music/ancienne+belgique) in Brussels the performances of the Belgian pop and variety pioneer [Bobbejaan Schoepen](http://www.last.fm/music/Bobbejaan+Schoepen). After some success his wife and daughters joined him from Belgium. By 1956 he was touring Europe and he recorded the song “Quand on n’a que l’amour”, which brought him his first major recognition. He appeared in a show with [Maurice Chevalier](http://www.last.fm/music/Maurice+Chevalier) and [Michel Legrand](http://www.last.fm/music/Michel+Legrand).      By the end of the 1950s Miche and Brel’s three daughters moved to Brussels. He and his family led separate lives from then on.
