**Greg Howe** (b. 1964) is a U.S. rock and jazz-rock guitarist, producer, and teacher.      Originally from Easton, Pennsylvania, he started his career as a shredder on [Mike Varney](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Varney)â€™s Shrapnel label in the 1980s, and became one of the founding fathers of the [shred](http://www.last.fm/tag/shred) trend alongside players such as [Marty Friedman](http://www.last.fm/music/Marty+Friedman), [Jason Becker](http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Becker), [Paul Gilbert](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Gilbert), [Richie Kotzen](http://www.last.fm/music/Richie+Kotzen), [Tony MacAlpine](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+MacAlpine), and [Vinnie Moore](http://www.last.fm/music/Vinnie+Moore), among others.      However, Howe soon developed a more distinctive style that was more rooted in jazz fusion than the neoclassical leanings of his contemporaries. His style borrows heavily from the jazz sensibilities of [Allan Holdsworth](http://www.last.fm/music/Allan+Holdsworth), but also mixes in a bluesy, groove-laden vibe and frequent use of unusual time signatures.      Apart from his solo career, Howe has established himself as a highly sought after session musician, being hired by mainstream acts such as [Michael Jackson](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson), [Enrique Iglesias](http://www.last.fm/music/Enrique+Iglesias), [*NSYNC](http://www.last.fm/music/*NSYNC), and [Justin Timberlake](http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Timberlake) to perform with them on tour.      Howe currently lives in Southern California.
