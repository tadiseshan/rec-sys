**Oysterband** (or **The Oyster Band**, as it used to be) are one of the few outfits still burning with the fire of punk, but managing to combine it with the ideals and knowledge of English folk music - a balancing act they’ve made into a fine art over the years. And they have deep roots in the U.K. folk scene, emerging from both the Whitstable Oyster Co. Ceilidh Band, which formed in 1975, and [Fiddler’s Dram](http://www.last.fm/music/Fiddler%27s+Dram), a group put together in 1973 by Dave Arbus, whose fiddle work had graced releases by [East of Eden](http://www.last.fm/music/East+of+Eden) and [The Who](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who).       Prosser, Telfer, and Taylor were also in Fiddler’s Dram, whose moment of fame arrived in 1979 with the British hit single “Day Trip to Bangor” - released after they’d split up. They reconvened for a last album when Kearey joined them. He also became part of the band’s alter ego, the roots-oriented [Oyster Ceilidh Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Oyster+Ceilidh+Band), as they’d now become. With Fiddler’s Dram no longer extant, the members put their energies in the newly renamed Oyster Band in 1981, playing gigs around England and self-releasing albums on their own Pukka label.      The band returned in 2003 after the longest recording layoff of its career with _Rise Above_, which included eight originals and two English traditional numbers, and featured the work of Irish piper James O’Grady throughout.      In 1990, the band collaborated with renowned folk singer [June Tabor](http://www.last.fm/music/June+Tabor) for the album _Freedom and Rain_ and a tour.
