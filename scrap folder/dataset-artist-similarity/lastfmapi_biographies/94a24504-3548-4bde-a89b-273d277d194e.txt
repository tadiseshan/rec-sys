Jack Bruce (born John Symon Asher Bruce on 14 May 1943 in Bishopbriggs, Lanarkshire, Scotland; died 25 October 2014 in Suffolk, England) was a Scottish musician and composer, known as a founder member of the seminal British psychedelic rock power trio, [Cream](http://www.last.fm/music/Cream), in the mid-to-late 1960s.      Widely considered to be one of the greatest bass players of all time, Bruce maintained a solo career that spanned several decades, and also played in several musical groups. Known as a vocalist and bass guitarist, Bruce was also a songwriter. Though trained as a classical cellist, and while he considered himself a jazz musician, much of his catalogue of compositions and recordings tended toward blues and rock and roll.      Beginning in 1962, Bruce started as double bass player with [Graham Bond](http://www.last.fm/music/Graham+Bond) in the [Graham Bond Organisation](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Graham+Bond+Organisation), which played a mixture of jazz, blues, and R&B. It was at this time that he met drummer [Ginger Baker](http://www.last.fm/music/Ginger+Baker). After stints with [John Mayall](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Mayall) and [Manfred Mann](http://www.last.fm/music/Manfred+Mann), he formed [Cream](http://www.last.fm/music/Cream) with Baker and guitarist [Eric Clapton](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton). Cream had numerous hits during its existence, most of them written by Bruce with lyricist [Pete Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Brown).      In the years since Creamâ€™s breakup in 1968, Bruce has released a number of solo albums, mostly in a more experimental vein, and worked with a wide variety of musicians in many genres. The list includes [Robin Trower](http://www.last.fm/music/Robin+Trower), [Tony Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Williams), [John McLaughlin](http://www.last.fm/music/John+McLaughlin), [Carla Bley](http://www.last.fm/music/Carla+Bley), [Allan Holdsworth](http://www.last.fm/music/Allan+Holdsworth), [Ringo Starr](http://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Starr) and [Frank Zappa](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Zappa). He was also a member of the band [West, Bruce And Laing](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/West,+Bruce+And+Laing).      In 1994 he had an album under the band name BBM (Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and Gary Moore) called Around the Next Dream.      Bruce released a new studio album Silver Rails in March 2014 on the Esoteric Antenna, his first solo studio album in over a decade.
