Micky Green, a.k.a. Michaela GehrÂ­mann, is an Australian pop singer now living in Paris. She has Dutch and German origins. She left home at 18 to be a model. She still models from time to time while she works on her music.      She played drums in a band in high-school. As a teenager, she was already writing. She always keeps a notebook and wrote most of her songs in airports and hotel rooms. Her first demos were recorded on her computer. To beat time, she used the sound of a pen on the table, a box, or her leg. She released her first album White T-Shirt in 2007, with the help of the producer Renaud Letang. Her music could be described as colorful, rhythmic and vocal pop.
