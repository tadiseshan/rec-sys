Born Louise Amanda Harman in Wembley, Lady Sovereign was raised on the Chalkhill estate. When she was 13, after having a liking for popular 90s artist, Ms. Dynamite, she started practicing rapping in the mirror with a hair brush. She left school when she was 16 and at the age of 17 she became one of the UK’s few white female MCs. She has been cited often as part of the rising British grime scene, and has received outside appreciation from moviegoers for her relation to Rupert Grint. Lady Sovereign cites Ms. Dynamite as an influence.      Lady Sovereign now resides in North London, England.      Career   Lady Sovereign first received attention when she recorded “The Battle”, a freestyle girls versus boys battle rap with [Shystie](http://www.last.fm/music/Shystie), Suz Rock and [Frost P](http://www.last.fm/music/Frost+P). Each rapper who participated in the recording of “The Battle” has since been signed to a record deal.      Lady Sovereign signed to Island Def Jam Music Group in 2005, after auditioning for Def Jam Recordings president and CEO, [Jay-Z](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay-Z) and The Island Def Jam Music Group chairman, Antonio “L.A.” Reid.      Shortly afterwards, “[Random](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Sovereign/_/Random)” was released. This was followed by “[9 to 5](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Sovereign/_/9+to+5)” which entered the UK Top 40 at number 33. The follow-up single, “[Hoodie](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Sovereign/_/Hoodie)” - produced by dance act [Basement Jaxx](http://www.last.fm/music/Basement+Jaxx) \- failed to reach the top 40, peaking at number 44. Lady Sovereign has since recorded with [Adrock](http://www.last.fm/music/Adrock) from the American rap group the [Beastie Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/Beastie+Boys) and American producer [Dr. Luke](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Luke).      When [The Ordinary Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ordinary+Boys) released the single “[Boys Will Be Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ordinary+Boys/_/Boys+Will+Be+Boys)”, Lady Sovereign came back with her own reply remix, featuring the music and chorus of the original, but with mostly her own vocals to the tune of “girls will be girls”. In May 2006, the favor was returned when she was featured on The Ordinary Boys single, “[Nine2Five](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ordinary+Boys/Nine2Five),” a remixed version of her own “9 to 5,” credited as “The Ordinary Boys vs Lady Sovereign.” “Nine2Five” entered at number 38 in the UK top 40 singles on downloads only, and jumped to #6 upon availability as a CD and 7” vinyl single during the week commencing May 22, 2006. This was her highest chart position to date and has helped to increase the media attention garnered by Lady Sovereign.      Lady Sovereign is the first non-American female to appear on the Def Jam label. Her former lack of success in the UK may be due in part to her stigma as representative of chav culture
