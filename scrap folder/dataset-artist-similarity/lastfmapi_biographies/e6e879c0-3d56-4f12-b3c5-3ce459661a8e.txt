**Jeffrey Scott “Jeff” Buckley** (born in Anaheim, California, USA on 17 November 1966 – 29 May 1997), raised as Scotty Moorhead, was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. He was the son of musicians [Tim Buckley](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Buckley) and Mary Guibert.      He had emerged in New York City’s [avant-garde](http://www.last.fm/tag/avant- garde) club scene in the 1990s as one of the most remarkable musical artists of his generation, acclaimed by audiences, critics, and fellow musicians alike. His first commercial recording, the four-song EP [Live at Sin-é](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley/Live+at+Sin-%C3%A9), was released in December 1993 on [Columbia](http://www.last.fm/label/Columbia) Records. The EP captured Buckley, accompanying himself on electric guitar, in a tiny coffeehouse in New York’s East Village, the neighbourhood he’d made his home.      Buckley made his public singing début at a tribute concert for his father called “Greetings from Tim Buckley”. The event, produced by show business veteran Hal Willner, was held at St. Ann’s Church in Brooklyn on 26 April 1991.      By the time of the EP’s release during the fall of 1993, Buckley had already entered the studio with Mick Grondahl (bass), Matt Johnson (drummer), and producer Andy Wallace and recorded seven original songs (including “Grace” and “Last Goodbye”) and three covers (among them Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, Benjamin Britten’s “Corpus Christi Carol”) that comprised his debut album Grace. Guitarist Michael Tighe became a permanent member of Jeff Buckley’s ensemble and went on to co-write and perform on Grace’s “So Real” just prior to the release of the album.      In early 1994, not long after Live At Sin-é appeared in stores, Jeff Buckley toured clubs, lounges, and coffeehouses in North America as a solo artist from January 15th to March 5th as well as in Europe from March 11th to 22th. Following extensive rehearsals in April to May of 1994, Buckley’s “Peyote Radio Theatre Tour” found him on the road with his band from June 2nd to August 16th. His full-length full-band album, [Grace](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley/Grace), was released in the United States on August 23rd, 1994, the same day Buckley and band kicked off a European tour in Dublin, Ireland; the 1994 European Tour ran through September 22nd, with Buckley and band performing at the CMJ convention at New York’s Supper Club on September 24. The group headed back into America’s clublands for a Fall Tour lasting from October 19th until December 18th.      On New Year’s Eve 1994-95, Buckley returned to Sin-é to perform a solo set; on New Year’s Day, he read an original poem at the annual St. Mark’s Church Marathon Poetry Reading. Two weeks later, he and his band were back in Europe for gigs in Dublin, Bristol, and London before launching an extensive tour of Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Holland, Belgium, and the United Kingdom which lasted from January 29th to March 5th
