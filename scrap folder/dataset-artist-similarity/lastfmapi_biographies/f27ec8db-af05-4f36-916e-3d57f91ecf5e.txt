He is also credited for popularizing many physically complicated dance moves, such as the robot and the moonwalk, and has influenced and spawned a whole generation of a wide variety of artists including [Justin Timberlake](http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Timberlake), [Mariah Carey](http://www.last.fm/music/Mariah+Carey) and [Usher](http://www.last.fm/music/Usher), among others.      Jackson’s musical career began in 1967 as lead singer of [The Jackson 5](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jackson+5), when the group made their first recording with a local label before signing up with Motown Records in 1968. He made his first solo recordings in 1971 while still a member of the group. But it was _[Off the Wall](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Off+the+Wall)_ (1979) which marked the start of his full-fledged solo career, and he formally parted with his siblings in 1984. In his solo career, Jackson recorded and co- produced the best-selling album of all time, _[Thriller](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Thriller)_ (with worldwide sales over 100 million), received thirteen Grammy awards and charted thirteen #1 singles in the U.S. Throughout his four-decade career, Michael Jackson has been awarded numerous honors, including the World Music Awards Best-selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium. He is also a double-inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997, and in 2001 as a solo artist. He is also a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the mid-1980s, _TIME_ magazine described Jackson as “the hottest single phenomenon since [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley)”. He has had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world while also tearing down racial barriers and paving the way for modern pop music.      From 1988 to 2005, Jackson lived on his Neverland Ranch property, on which he built an amusement park and private zoo for the enjoyment of economically disadvantaged and terminally ill children. In 1993 and 2003, separate accusations of child molestation that allegedly occurred in Neverland were made against Jackson, which drew intense negative media coverage. While he was never charged for the first case, Jackson was tried and vindicated in 2005 of the latter allegation, but moved out of the US shortly thereafter. He later returned to Las Vegas in early 2007
