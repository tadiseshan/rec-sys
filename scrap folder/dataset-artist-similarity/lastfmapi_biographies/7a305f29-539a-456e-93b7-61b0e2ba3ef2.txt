Famed rapper, singer, model and actress Dana Elaine Owens, better known by her stage name **Queen Latifah**, was born on March 18, 1970, in Newark, New Jersey. Her debut album _All Hail to the Queen_ sold more than 1 million copies, and the single _U.N.I.T.Y._ earned Latifah her first Grammy Award. Latifah has also garnered acclaim for acting; she earned her first Oscar nomination (best supporting actress) for her performance in the blockbuster musical Chicago. She has also earned a Golden Globe award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, two Image Awards, six additional Grammy nominations, an Emmy Award nomination and an Academy Award nomination.      Latifah was born and raised in the public housing projects of Newark, New Jersey, the daughter of Rita, a schoolteacher who worked at Irvington High School, and Lancelot Owens, a policeman. Her parents divorced when Latifah was ten. Latifah performed the number “Home” from the musical _The Wiz_ in a high school play. Her stage name, Latifah (لطيفة), meaning “kind” in Arabic, was given to her when she was eight by her cousin. Latifah was raised in the Baptist church, and, while in high school, was a power forward on her basketball team.      She started her career beatboxing for the rap group _Ladies Fresh_. Latifah was one of the members of the original version of the [Flavor Unit MC’s](http://www.last.fm/music/Flavor+Unit+MC%27s), which, at that time, was a crew of MC’s grouped around producer DJ Mark [The 45 King](http://www.last.fm/music/The+45+King). In 1988, DJ Mark the 45 King heard a demo version of Latifah’s single _Princess of the Posse_ and gave the demo to [Fab 5 Freddy](http://www.last.fm/music/Fab+5+Freddy), who was the host of _Yo! MTV Raps_. The recording captured the attention of Tommy Boy Music employee Dante Ross, who immediately signed Latifah, and in 1988 issued her first single, _Wrath of My Madness_. The track met with a positive response and afforded her the opportunity to launch a European tour, and to perform at the Harlem’s famed Apollo Theater. The next year Latifah released her first album, _All Hail the Queen_, which went on to sell more than 1 million copies.      As she began to earn money, Latifah displayed an interest in investment, putting money into a delicatessen and a video store on the ground floor of the apartment in which she was living. She came to realize that she had a knack for business, and realized that there was an opening for her in record production. In 1991, Latifah organized and became chief executive officer of the _Flavor Unit Records_ and Management Company, headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. In the same year she was released her sophomore album, called _Nature of a Sista’_. It was the final album on Tommy Boy Records. By late 1993, the company had signed 17 rap groups, including the very successful [Naughty By Nature](http://www.last.fm/music/Naughty+By+Nature)
