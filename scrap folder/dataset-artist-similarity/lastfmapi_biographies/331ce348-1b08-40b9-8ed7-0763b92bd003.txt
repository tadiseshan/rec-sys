Roxy Music is a British [art rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/art%20rock) group which formed in 1971 in London, England. Led throughout by [Bryan Ferry](http://www.last.fm/music/Bryan+Ferry) (vocals, keyboards), the band attained popular and critical success in Europe and Australia during the 1970s and early 1980s, beginning with their 1972 eponymous debut album. Over its time, the band has been highly influential as leading proponents of the more genre-bending, musically-sophisticated elements of [glam rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/glam%20rock), as well as providing a model for many [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) acts and [experimental](http://www.last.fm/tag/experimental) [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) groups of the early 1980s.      The band’s original lineup consisted of [Bryan Ferry](http://www.last.fm/music/Bryan+Ferry) (vocals, keyboards), [Phil Manzanera](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Manzanera) (guitar), [Andy Mackay](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Mackay) (saxophone, oboe), [Brian Eno](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno) (synthesizer, “treatments”), Graham Simpson (bass) and Paul Thompson (drums, percussion). Simpson left the band in 1972, and Eno left in 1973. After Eno left the band, he was replaced by Eddie Jobson (synthesizer, violin).      Roxy Music were a significant influence on the early English punk movement, as well as providing a model for many “New Wave” acts and the subsequent New Romantic and experimental electronic groups of the early 1980s. Ferry and co- founding member Brian Eno have also had broadly influential solo careers. Brian Eno has emerged as one of the most significant record producers of the late 20th century, with credits including landmark albums by [David Bowie](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie), [Devo](http://www.last.fm/music/Devo), [Talking Heads](http://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads), [The Slits](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Slits), and [U2](http://www.last.fm/music/U2). Eno is widely credited for coining the term - [ambient music](http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient%20music) \- and has collaborated with, and/or produced such important artists as [Daniel Lanois](http://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Lanois),[Harold Budd](http://www.last.fm/music/Harold+Budd), [David Byrne](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Byrne), [Robert Fripp](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Fripp) ([King Crimson](http://www.last.fm/music/King+Crimson) ), [Cluster](http://www.last.fm/music/Cluster), [Jon Hassell](http://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Hassell), and [Jah Wobble](http://www.last.fm/music/Jah+Wobble), among many others.      The group’s name was partly an homage to the titles of old cinemas and dance halls, and partly a pun on the word ‘rock’. Ferry had first named the band Roxy, but learning of an American band with the same name prompted the alteration of the name
