**Betty Davis** is a pseudonym of **[Betty Mabry](http://www.last.fm/music/Betty+Mabry)** (b. 26 Jul 1945 in New York City, NY, USA), a [funk](http://www.last.fm/tag/funk), [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) and [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) singer-songwriter. **Mabry**’s début was as a songwriter, with [The Chambers Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chambers+Brothers)’s **[Uptown](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chambers+Brothers/_/Uptown)** (1967, [Columbia](http://www.last.fm/label/Columbia)).      When **Betty** turned sixteen, she moved to New York and met several musicians including [Jimi Hendrix](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix) and [Sly Stone](http://www.last.fm/music/Sly+Stone). She met [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis) in 1967 and married him in 1968. As he stated in his autobiography, in addition to creating turmoil in his personal life, his wife helped him to explore music by introducing him to psychedelic rock guitarist Hendrix and funk innovator Stone. There is plenty of circumstantial evidence, though seemingly no credible documentation, to support the idea that Miles Davis named his masterpiece jazz-fusion album _[Bitches Brew](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/Bitches+Brew)_ after Betty.      After the breakup of her marriage, Davis moved to London to pursue her modelling career. She wrote music - a passion since childhood - while in the U.K. and returned to the U.S. with the intention of recording songs with [Santana](http://www.last.fm/music/Santana) and [The Commodores](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Commodores). When those projects didn’t work out, she organised a group of talented West Coast funk musicians and recorded the songs under her own name.      Her first album, _Betty Davis_, was released in 1973 and her band included members of [Sly and the Family Stone](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sly+and+the+Family+Stone), [Graham Central Station](http://www.last.fm/music/Graham+Central+Station), [The Pointer Sisters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pointer+Sisters), [Tower of Power](http://www.last.fm/music/Tower+of+Power), and [Neil Schon](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Neil+Schon) who came from [Santana](http://www.last.fm/music/Santana), but went on to form [Journey](http://www.last.fm/music/Journey). Davis released two more studio albums: _They Say I’m Different_ (1974) and _Nasty Gal_ (1975). Her backing band, Funkhouse,consisted of her cousin, Larry Johnson on bass, Fred Mills on keyboards, double-platinum artist Carlton Morales on guitar, and Nikki Neal on drums. None of the three albums was a commercial success, and Davis’s 1976 album _[Is It Love or Desire](http://www.last.fm/music/Betty+Davis/Is+It+Love+or+Desire)_ remained unreleased until 2009.      Davis remained a cult figure as a singer, due in part to her open sexual attitude, which was controversial for the time and remains so thirty years later
