William “Bootsy” Collins (born October 26, 1951 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is a pioneering funk bassist, singer, and songwriter. Bootsy was instrumental in [Parliament](http://www.last.fm/music/Parliament) and [Funkadelic](http://www.last.fm/music/Funkadelic) together with [George Clinton](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Clinton) and [Bernie Worrell](http://www.last.fm/music/Bernie+Worrell). He is well known as one of the founding members of the ‘P-Funk’ sound. He also played a major part in resurrecting [James Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown)’s career in the late 60s and early 70s, co-writing some of Brown’s greatest hits along with his brother, Phelps “Catfish” Collins.With his older brother Catfish Collins, and Kash Waddy and Philippé Wynne, Collins formed a group called The Pacesetters in 1968.      In March 1970, after most of the members of James Brown’s band quit over a pay dispute, The Pacesetters were hired as Brown’s backing band and they became known as The J.B.’s. (They are often referred to as the “original” J.B.’s to distinguish them from later line-ups that went by the same name.) Although they worked for Brown for only 11 months, the original J.B.’s played on some of Brown’s most intense funk recordings, including “Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine”, “Super Bad”, “Soul Power”, and “Talkin’ Loud and Sayin’ Nothing”.      It is known that the young Bootsy clashed several times with the rigid system Brown used to discipline the young band whenever he felt they stepped out of line. After leaving the band Collins then moved to Detroit, following the advice of singer and future Parliament member Mallia Franklin      After parting ways with James Brown, Bootsy returned to Cincinnati and formed House Guests with his brother Phelps Collins, Rufus Allen, Clayton “Chicken” Gunnels, Frank Waddy, Ronnie Greenaway and Robert McCullough. The House Guests released two singles on the House Guests label as well as a third as The Sound of Vision on the House Guess label.      Franklin introduced both Collins brothers to George Clinton, and 1972 saw both of the Collins brothers, along with Waddy, join Funkadelic. Bootsy played on the subsequent Funkadelic album ‘America Eats Its Young’, but it would be a another couple of years before he really began to make his mark on the P-Funk mob. Appearing on Funkadelic’s ‘Let’s Take It To The Stage’ and Parliament’s ‘Up For The Down Stroke’ Bootsy soon became a defining member, both in sound and song-writing and is credited on all of the late 70s classics.      In 1976 Bootsy, Catfish, Waddy, Joel Johnson, Gary “Mudbone” Cooper, Robert Johnson and The Horny Horns formed Bootsy’s Rubber Band, a separate touring unit of Clinton’s P-Funk collective. The group recorded four albums together, the first three of which are often considered to be among the quintessential P-Funk recordings
