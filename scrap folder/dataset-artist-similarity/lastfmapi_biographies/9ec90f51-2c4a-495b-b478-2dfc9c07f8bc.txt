Cerrone (full name: Jean-Marc Cerrone) (born 24 May 1952, Vitry-sur-Seine, near Paris, France) is an iconic and influential French European [disco](http://www.last.fm/tag/disco) and [dance pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/dance%20pop) drummer, singer, and music producer. Marc Cerrone has sold over thirty million albums. He claims, and it is often credited by others, that he was “the first” to put the kick drum (or bass drum) into the foreground of modern [eurodance](http://www.last.fm/tag/eurodance) music. At the age of 12, he started playing drums and listening to [Otis Redding](http://www.last.fm/music/Otis+Redding)’s songs. His passion for music scared his father, who tried to distract him from his obsession. By the end of the [60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s), he was fascinated by, among others, [Jimi Hendrix](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix), [Carlos Santana](http://www.last.fm/music/Carlos+Santana), and [Blood, Sweat & Tears](http://www.last.fm/music/Blood,+Sweat+&+Tears).      At the age of 17, he convinced Gilbert Trigano to hire rock bands for his famous holiday clubs: Club Med (Club Mediterranée). Cerrone became the A&R (artist and repertoire) scout for 40 Club Med vacation villages around the world. His first recordings as a part of Kongas were released on Barclay, where he released his first hit, Boom. He is most famous from the Kongas days for “Anikana-O”, co-written and produced by Alec R. Costandinos. A remix done by the legendary Tom Moulton was done for the US release on Salsoul Records. This mix was also used on international releases as well.      Based in Paris, Cerrone recorded, composed and performed his solo debut “Love In C Minor”, again with Costandinos. Released on his own Malligator imprint, and distributed by Warner Filipacci in France, it immediately shocked audiences with its erotic flavour and controversial cover, which was soon to be a Cerrone trademark. It was later released with a new, tamer cover that took flashes of nude women into the background and replaced them with four arms clenched instead for the American release. Additionally, label censors edited out the infamous bar conversation at the beginning of the 17 minute masterpiece in the U.S., with the girls in conversation cheekily talking about Cerrone’s perceived endowment. It also featured a cover of Los Bravos’ “Black Is Black” and “Midnite Lady”, a dramatic and anthemic, almost soundtrack directed instrumental piece that closed his brilliant debut. Cotillion Records released the album through Warner distribution in the U.S. The album was released un-edited in Canada, using the original master tapes. The album was recorded and mixed at Trident Studios in London, which was to become the mainstay of French disco producers for the year that follows as it was one of the first 48 track recording studios in the world
