Princess Superstar (born Concetta Kirschner) is an American rapper of Jewish- Italian heritage from the suburbs of Philadelphia. She calls her music - a mixture of hip hop, rock and electronica -“flip flop.”      After graduating from high school, she moved to New York City and studied acting at New York University. She also learned to play the guitar and sent a demo tape to the College Music Journal and Grand Royal, a record label headed by the Beastie Boys. Her debut album, Strictly Platinum, gained her some notoriety for being one of very few white rappers, as well as for her openness regarding her Jewish heritage and gender-related issues.      Princess Superstar has collaborated with Kool Keith, Jon Spencer, MC Paul Barman, the High and Mighty, The Prodigy, Moby, Disco D and others. Some of the producers that worked with her include Prince Paul, Curtis Curtis, Beth Orton, Arthur Baker, Jacques Lu Cont, Junior Sanchez, Todd Terry, and DJ Mighty Mi from the High and Mighty.      Her biggest single so far has been “Bad Babysitter,” which was chart position #11 in the UK. In 2007, a mash-up was created using Princess Superstar’s “Perfect” and “Exceeder” by DJ Mason. The resulting track was called “Perfect Exceeder.” It has become another one of Princess Superstar’s top songs.
