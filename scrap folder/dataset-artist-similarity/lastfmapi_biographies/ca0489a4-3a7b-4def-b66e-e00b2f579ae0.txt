Daniel Lanois (born September 19, 1951 in Hull, Québec is a Canadian record producer and [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter). He has produced albums for a wide variety of artists and released a number of albums of his own work. Artists he has worked with include [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan), [U2](http://www.last.fm/music/U2), [Brian Eno](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno), [Peter Gabriel](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel), [Robbie Robertson](http://www.last.fm/music/Robbie+Robertson), [Chris Whitley](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Whitley), [Ron Sexsmith](http://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Sexsmith) and [Nash The Slash](http://www.last.fm/music/Nash+The+Slash).      He started his production career working in his own studio, Grant Avenue Studios in Hamilton, Ontario. He worked with a number of local bands, most notably [Martha and the Muffins](http://www.last.fm/music/Martha+and+the+Muffins), for whom his sister Jocelyne played bass, [Ray Materick](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Materick), as well as the Canadian children’s singer [Raffi](http://www.last.fm/music/Raffi).      After being discovered by Brian Eno and working collaboratively with him on some of Eno’s own projects, his career was given a huge boost when Eno invited him to co-produce U2’s album [The Unforgettable Fire](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Unforgettable+Fire). Along with Eno, he went on to produce U2’s [The Joshua Tree](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Joshua+Tree), the 1987 Grammy Winner for Album of the Year. [Bono](http://www.last.fm/music/Bono) of U2 recommended Lanois to Bob Dylan in the late 1980s; in 1989 Lanois produced Dylan’s [Oh Mercy](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Oh+Mercy), widely considered one of Dylan’s greatest later albums. Eight years later Dylan and Lanois worked together on [Time Out of Mind](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Time+Out+of+Mind), Dylan’s first studio album of original material since 1990, which won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997.      Wrecking Ball, his 1995 collaboration with [Emmylou Harris](http://www.last.fm/music/Emmylou+Harris), received almost unanimous critical praise (many critics placed the album on their year-end “best albums of the year” lists), and revived the aging country artist’s career, bringing her to the attention of much younger rock audiences.      As well as being a producer, singer and songwriter, Daniel Lanois plays the guitar, pedal steel and drums. His desire is to bring out the best in the artists he works with and produces, with his wide range of talents and musical ideas. He often leaves an atmospheric and emotionally resonant sound on the projects he produces, which some say has become his ‘signature sound’.      Daniel founded Red Floor Records to release his own music albums and DVD films that he sells direct to consumers from his website in high resolution downloads and traditional formats: [www.DanielLanois.com](http://www.DanielLanois
