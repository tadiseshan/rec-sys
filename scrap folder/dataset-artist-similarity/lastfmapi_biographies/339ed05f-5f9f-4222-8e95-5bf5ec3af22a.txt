Sean D. Jacobs (born November 9, 1976 in Brooklyn, New York), better known as Sheek Louch, is a rapper and member of The Lox, founded in 1994 which includes [Jadakiss](http://www.last.fm/music/Jadakiss) and [Styles P](http://www.last.fm/music/Styles+P).      After appearing on two Lox albums, 1998’s platinum debut Money, Power & Respect, and 2000’s follow-up We Are The Streets, Sheek became a business man. First, he bought a recording studio in his hometown city of Yonkers, NY, and then founded the record label D-Block with lifelong friends Jadakiss and Styles P.      When Jadakiss feuded with Beanie Sigel, the battle also brought along Sheek Louch and Styles P. Shortly before Beans went to jail, however, Sigel and Kiss made up definitively, performing together at a show; after his release from jail, the two did a remix on a Sheek Louch song and appeared on a track on a Funkmaster Flex compilation.      When The Lox left Bad Boy Records, the group and each of its members’ publication was still owned by label head Sean Combs. The group fought with him over royalties, debt issues and other things until 2005 when they briefly put their differences aside to perform with Jay-Z at his I Declare War concert.Combs still owned The Lox’s publishing because they only completed one album on their contract. Afterward they went on New York radio station Hot 97 bashing Diddy about taking all their money.      Sheek Louch has played a supporting role in D-Block’s battle with 50 Cent. Originally, after a guest appearance in Ja Rule’s single “New York”, Jadakiss was insulted on 50 Cent’s track “Piggy Bank” on the 2005 album The Massacre. Sheek has in turn insulted 50 Cent and other members of G-Unit on tracks on various mixtapes, including ones by Big Mike and DJ Clue.         Shame on you for ever underestimating Sheek. Shame on you for thinking that his membership in the LOX is all he had and all he’d ever be. After dropping two LOX albums, 1998’s platinum debut Money, Power & Respect, and 2000’s chart topping follow up We are the Streets, Sheek became a business man. First, he bought a recording studio in his hometown town of Yonkers, NY. Then, he founded the record label D-Block with lifelong friends Jadakiss and Styles P. Sheek has been quietly focused. While Jadakiss and Styles were busy making guest appearances with everyone from Mary J. Blige to Jennifer Lopez, Sheek was planning and securing the foundation for what will undoubtedly become one of hip hop’s greatest classics, “D Block.” As the first artist signed to D-Block, Sheek’s debut Walk Witt Me takes hip hop back to the good days when MCs rapped with the kind of passionate power that could move entire coasts. After listening to Walk Witt Me, you’ll never sleep on Sheek again. In fact, you’ll be excitedly waiting for the next 16 bar ride through his life. “This album is all me,” says Sheek. “With the LOX, I have to write about the topic agreed on by all three of us
