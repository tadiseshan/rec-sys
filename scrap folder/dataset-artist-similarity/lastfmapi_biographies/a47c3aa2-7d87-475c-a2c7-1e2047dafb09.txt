**Gnarls Barkley** is an alternative/soul group which formed in 2003 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The group consists of [CeeLo Green](http://www.last.fm/music/CeeLo+Green) (vocals) and Brian “[Danger Mouse](http://www.last.fm/music/Danger+Mouse)” Burton (multiple instruments). The group is best known for the international smash hit “[Crazy](http://www.last.fm/music/Gnarls+Barkley/_/Crazy)”.       “Crazy” - which was their first single - debuted at #1 on the British pop charts on April 2, 2006. It was the first #1 UK single to be obtained solely through Internet downloads. The success of the single in the UK was due largely to its use in a promotional trailer for Radio 1 across all of the BBC TV channels prior to the single’s release. ‘Crazy’ stayed at #1 for almost 9 weeks.      The buzz for “Crazy” helped generate a lot of press coverage of their debut album, [St. Elsewhere](http://www.last.fm/music/Gnarls+Barkley/St.+Elsewhere), which was released on May 9, 2006.      The album is seen as a cross-over between hip-hop, rock and soul. Both artists have previously been known to have a quirky experimental side, moving between different genres of music.      Producer [DJ Danger Mouse](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/DJ+Danger+Mouse) began his career doing remixes of [indie rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rock) artists like [Neutral Milk Hotel](http://www.last.fm/music/Neutral+Milk+Hotel) and [downbeat](http://www.last.fm/tag/downbeat) [instrumental](http://www.last.fm/tag/instrumental) music under the ‘[Pelican City](http://www.last.fm/music/Pelican+City)’ alias. He later went on to emphasize more [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) production: most notably his _[The Grey Album](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/DJ+Danger+Mouse/The+Grey+Album)_, a remix of [Black Album](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay-Z/Black+Album), with samples exclusively from [The White Album](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/The+White+Album); 2005’s [DANGERDOOM](http://www.last.fm/music/DANGERDOOM) collaboration with [MF DOOM](http://www.last.fm/music/MF+DOOM); and, most recently, the double platinum [Demon Days](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/Demon+Days).      Gnarls Barkley singer [Cee Lo Green](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Cee+Lo+Green) started out in the classic [southern rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/southern%20rap) group [Goodie Mob](http://www.last.fm/music/Goodie+Mob), but later developed a unique [funk](http://www.last.fm/tag/funk)-inspired soulful style of singing which developed on his solo albums.      Their new album The Odd Couple was released March 18, 2008.
