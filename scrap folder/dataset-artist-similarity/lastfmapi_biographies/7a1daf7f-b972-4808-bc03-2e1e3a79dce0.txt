At the age of 14, the Belgian-Italian Lara Fabian was unknowingly setting the stage for an impressive international career by singing in Brussels’s clubs. A few years later, after winning many European contests and gaining some popularity, she launched her first single, followed by her first self-titled album…   Three years after the release of her first album, which went gold and platinum, she released her second album, Carpe Diem, which launched the career of this singer-songwriter in French-speaking countries, especially in Quebec. Within three weeks, the album went gold. She then took her music on tour, performing to over 150,000 admirers, while her album went three times platinum. She was especially appreciated by the Canadian public and music industry. In 1995, she was awarded two FÃ©lix awards by Quebec’s association of recording artists (ADISQ), namely Best Female Vocalist of the year (by popular vote), and Best Live Performance of the year.   Then, things began to pick up!   In 1996, Walt Disney Studios immortalized Lara’s voice. In addition to incarnating Esmeralda, the heroine of the animated feature The Hunchback of Notre Dame, she sang the theme song (“Que Dieu aide les exclus”) on the film’s soundtrack.   In October, her third album “Pure” went platinum in less than two weeks. Thanks to this album, she won the 1997 Félix for Album of the Year. The same year, “Pure” was launched in France where over two million albums were sold within two years. Thanks to this resounding success, which eloquently expressed the affection of her loving and faithful fans, Lara was awarded the prize for New Artist of the Year at the prestigious French gala Les Victoires de la Musique. This was in February 1998, a few months before the concert tour in several French cities that led to the recording of an album (Lara Fabian Live) in March 1999 which went platinum a few months later. Lara Fabian was praised by music lovers and critics alike…   In addition to receiving the Félix for Quebec Artist Having the Most Impact Outside Quebec, she was voted Personality of the Year by the magazine Paris Match, which featured her on its front cover. While her fame grew, she was honored at the World Music Awards for Best Selling Artist for “Pure”. Between appearances in Europe, Lara often returned to New York City and San Francisco to record her first album in English. She wrote or co-wrote most of the songs, working with Rick Allison and producers Walter Afanasieff (Mariah Carey), Pat Leonard (Madonna), Sam Watters (ex-Color Me Badd) and Brian Rawling (Cher’s “I Believe”).   Produced by Sony Records, the self-titled album was launched in May 2000 on America’s most popular morning television show, NBC’s Today Show. Invitations poured in, and Lara Fabian appeared on The Tonight Show, The View, Access Hollywood, Craig Kilborn, Entertainment Tonight…   The album’s first excerpt, I will Love Again, hit No
