[Patti Austin](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+Austin) (born August 10, 1950, in Harlem New York) is a Grammy Award winning singer who records in various styles of secular music including Adult Contemporary, Dance-pop, Pop, Soul, R&B, and Jazz. She made her debut at the Apollo Theater at age four and had a contract with [RCA Records](http://www.last.fm/label/RCA+Records) when she was only five. [Quincy Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Quincy+Jones) and [Dinah Washington](http://www.last.fm/music/Dinah+Washington) have proclaimed themselves as her godparents.      By the late 1960s Austin was a prolific session musician and commercial jingle singer. By the 1980s she was signed to Jones’s Qwest Records and she began having hits. She charted twenty R&B songs between 1969 and 1991 and had success on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where she hit number one in 1981 with “[Do You Love Me?](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+Austin/_/Do+You+Love+Me%3F)” / “[The genie](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+Austin/_/The+genie).”      The album containing that hit, [Every Home Should Have One](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+Austin/Every+Home+Should+Have+One), also produced her biggest mainstream hit. “[Baby, Come To Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+Austin/_/Baby,+Come+To+Me),” a duet with [James Ingram](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Ingram), peaked at number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1982. After being featured as the love theme in a prominent storyline on the soap opera General Hospital, the song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart in October and went to number one in early 1983.      Next Austin released her third album in three years entitled “Gettin’ Away With Murder”. In addition to the title track, she had two more hit singles, “Honey For The Bees” (#24 R&B and #6 Dance) and “The Heat of Heat”. Produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, noted for their later work with Janet Jackson, the latter track returned Austin to the top 15 of the R&B charts for what would be the last time to date. It would also be her last Hot 100 charting to date, peaking at number 55, although she would score a top-5 dance hit with the single Reach that appeared originally on her 1994 CD That Secret Place (GRP Records). “Gettin’ Away With Murder” used producers Russ Titelman, Tommy LiPuma, Monte Moir (of “The Time”), and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Billy Joel (Austin sang background on his “Just The Way You Are”), Dan Hartman, friends Luther Vandross and Jocelyn Brown, along with Chaka Khan were among the background vocalists on the project, with successful songwriters, Randy Goodrum, Michael Bolton, Jam & Lewis plus several other big name writers offering up their best compositions on what was likely a big budget affair. She next appeared with Jeff Bridges and Joan Allen in Francis Ford Coppola’s critically acclaimed period piece Tucker: The Man and his Dream (1988)
