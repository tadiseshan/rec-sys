**Jefferson Airplane** was a [psychedelic rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/psychedelic%20rock) group formed in San Francisco. It was the first of several Bay Area psychedelic groups of the 1960s to become internationally known. The band was founded by singer [Marty Balin](http://www.last.fm/music/Marty+Balin) and guitarist [Paul Kantner](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Kantner) in 1965. With the addition of Signe Anderson, their male-female singing style showed their folk music roots plus Balin’s love of R&B singing styles. In fact their dual lead vocals were a hallmark of their sound throughout the Airplane’s career, as confirmed (to international acclaim) after [Grace Slick](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Slick) replaced Signe Anderson as the female singer. The other members of the band were guitarist [Jorma Kaukonen](http://www.last.fm/music/Jorma+Kaukonen), bassist [Jack Casady](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Casady) and drummer [Alexander “Skip” Spence](http://www.last.fm/music/Alexander+%22Skip%22+Spence).      After the release of their first studio album, _[Takes Off](http://www.last.fm/music/Jefferson+Airplane/Takes+Off)_ (only released in the USA), Anderson and Spence left the band. They were replaced by [Grace Slick](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Slick) and [Spencer Dryden](http://www.last.fm/music/Spencer+Dryden), respectively. Grace Slick brought with her an amazing voice, attitude and two songs from her former band [The Great Society](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Great+Society). Both songs, “[Somebody to Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Jefferson+Airplane/_/Somebody+to+Love)” and “[White Rabbit](http://www.last.fm/music/Jefferson+Airplane/_/White+Rabbit)”, received much airplay and helped make the band’s second album _[Surrealistic Pillow](http://www.last.fm/music/Jefferson+Airplane/Surrealistic+Pillow)_ a big seller, and also to pretty much define San Francisco’s “Summer of Love” zeitgeist, just as the psychedelic era was coming into full bloom.      _Surrealistic Pillow_ is an interesting mixture of largely folk-rock vocals, acoustic guitar and songs that reflected the changes emerging in youth culture as the world was beginning to become aware of the Haight-Ashbury scene.      Influenced by the new sounds of [Jimi Hendrix](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix) and [Cream](http://www.last.fm/music/Cream), their next album After Bathing at Baxter’s swung radically toward a heavier electric and much more experimental sound, largely provided by guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and bass guitar player Jack Casady.      On the next couple of albums, Crown of Creation and Volunteers, Kantner and Slick’s influence came to the foreground and these albums included political, anthemic songs strongly critical of mainstream social values
