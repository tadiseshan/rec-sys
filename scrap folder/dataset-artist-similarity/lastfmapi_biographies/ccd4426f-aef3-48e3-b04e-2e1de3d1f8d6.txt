A Fine Frenzy is a band led by [Alison Sudol](http://www.last.fm/music/Alison+Sudol) (born December 23, 1984 in Seattle, Washington), an American singer, songwriter and pianist. They released their first studio album [One Cell in the Sea](http://www.last.fm/music/A+Fine+Frenzy/One+Cell+in+the+Sea) on July 17, 2007.      Born in Seattle to dramatic-arts teacher parents, Alison moved to Los Angeles, US at the age of five. With her newly single mother, Alison moved frequently around the city. She developed a strong love for the fantastic literary worlds of CS Lewis, EB White, Lewis Carroll and Charles Dickens, while becoming a passionate author in her own right.      In an interview with [www.spinner.com](http://www.spinner.com) Alison Sudol shares how she came up with the band’s name “(I) had a bunch of books open on a table, “a fine frenzy” jumped off a page of ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ [Shakespeare] and it was just right, though every now and then I wonder if it’s a bit … flowery.”      Alison also immersed herself in classical music, [Motown](http://www.last.fm/music/Motown), [Aretha Franklin](http://www.last.fm/music/Aretha+Franklin), swing bands, [Ella Fitzgerald](http://www.last.fm/music/Ella+Fitzgerald), [Elton John](http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John), [Louis Armstrong](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Armstrong), [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles), Technicolor movies and classic 1950’s television.      After teaching herself to play piano, Alison increasingly invested her internal narratives into song form. She found solace in the melodic melancholia of new global British bands [Aqualung](http://www.last.fm/music/Aqualung), [Radiohead](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead), [Coldplay](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay), [Keane](http://www.last.fm/music/Keane), etc… She was also moved by the diatonic minimalism of [Philip Glass](http://www.last.fm/music/Philip+Glass) and the transportive allure of Icelandic music ([Björk](http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk), [Sigur Rós](http://www.last.fm/music/Sigur+R%C3%B3s)). She graduated from Delphi Academy Los Angeles in 2001. Inspired, Alison Sudol developed the sound of A Fine Frenzy - hypnotic piano arrangements under classic American melody fused into irresistible, atmospheric songs with the power to reach around the world.
