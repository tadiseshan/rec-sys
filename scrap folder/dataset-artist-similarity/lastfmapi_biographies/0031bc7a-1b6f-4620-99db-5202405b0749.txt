**Lena Mary Calhoun Horne** (June 30, 1917 â€“ May 9, 2010) was an American singer, actress, civil rights activist and dancer. She was born in Brooklyn, New York. She had recorded and performed extensively, both independently, and with other jazz notables, including [Artie Shaw](http://www.last.fm/music/Artie+Shaw), [Teddy Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Wilson), [Billy Strayhorn](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Strayhorn), [Duke Ellington](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Ellington), [Charlie Barnet](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Barnet), [Benny Carter](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Carter), and [Billy Eckstine](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Eckstine).      In her biography she stated that on the day she was born, her father was in the midst of a card game trying to get money to pay the hospital costs. Her parents divorced while she was still a toddler. Her mother left later in order to find work as an actress and Lena was left in the care of her grandparents. When she was seven her mother returned and the two traveled around the state, which meant that Lena was enrolled in numerous schools (for a time she also attended schools in Florida, Georgia and Ohio). Later she returned to Brooklyn.      She quit school when she was 14 and got her first stage job at 16, dancing and later singing at the famed [Cotton Club](http://www.last.fm/music/Cotton+Club) in Harlem (a renowned theatre in which black performers played before white audiences, immortalized in the film - The Cotton Club (1984)). She was in good hands at the club, especially when people such as [Cab Calloway](http://www.last.fm/music/Cab+Calloway) and [Duke Ellington](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Ellington) took her under their wings and helped her over the rough spots.      Before long her talent resulted in her playing before packed houses. If she had never made a film, her music career would have been enough to have ensured her legendary status in the entertainment industry, but films were icing on the cake. After she made an appearances on Broadway, Hollywood came calling.      At 21 years of age Lena made her first film, The Duke Is Tops (1938). It would be four more years before she appeared in another, Panama Hattie (1942), playing a singer in a nightclub. By now Lena had signed with MGM but, unfortunately for her, the pictures were shot so that her scenes could be cut out when they were shown in the South, since most theatres in the South refused to show films that portrayed blacks in anything other than subservient roles to whites, and most film studios did not want to take a chance on losing that particular source of revenue. Lena did not want to appear in those kinds of stereotyped roles (and who could blame her?).      In 1943 MGM loaned her to 20th Century-Fox to play the role of Selina Rogers in the all-black musical Stormy Weather (1943), which did extremely well at the box-office. Her rendition of the title song became a major hit on the musical charts
