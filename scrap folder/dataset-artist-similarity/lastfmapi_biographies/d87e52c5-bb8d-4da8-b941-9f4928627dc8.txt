**ABBA** was a [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) music group that formed in Stockholm, Sweden in November 1970. The band consisted of [Anni-Frid Lyngstad](http://www.last.fm/music/Anni-Frid+Lyngstad) ([Frida](http://www.last.fm/music/Frida)), [Björn Ulvaeus](http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rn+Ulvaeus), [Benny Andersson](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Andersson), and [Agnetha Fältskog](http://www.last.fm/music/Agnetha+F%C3%A4ltskog). (See also [Björn Ulvaeus & Benny Andersson](http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rn+Ulvaeus+&+Benny+Andersson), as well as Benny’s previous band [Hep Stars](http://www.last.fm/music/Hep+Stars).)      They topped the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982 with eight studio albums, achieving twenty-six #1 singles and numerous awards. They also won the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with “[Waterloo](http://www.last.fm/music/ABBA/_/Waterloo)”.      A [jukebox musical](http://www.last.fm/tag/jukebox%20musical) based on the music of ABBA titled _[Mamma Mia!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamma_Mia!)_ opened in London’s West End in 1999 and has since become one of the most popular musicals in the world. In 2008, a movie version was made with [Meryl Streep](http://www.last.fm/music/Meryl+Streep) among the cast.      The recent [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2010 Induction Ceremony](http://rockhall.com/inductees/abba/), held on March 15 in New York, recognized the huge contribution of ABBA. Represented by Anni-Frid Lyngstad “Frida” and former husband/band member Benny Andersson, it was perhaps the crowning acknowledgment of the phenomenal success of Sweden’s most famous four.
