Giorgio Gaber, true name Giorgio Gaberscik, born January 25, 1939 in Milan, died January 1, 2003 in Montemagno near Camaiore (Lucca), was an Italian actor, composer, and musician. But truly, no definition can completely suit a personality like Gaber, affectionately called “il Signor G” (Mister G) by his fans. He was also a good guitar player, and author of the first rock song in Italian (Ciao ti dirò, 1958).      Very appreciated have been his performances like author and actor of theatre: he was father, together with Sandro Luporini, to the musical genre called teatro canzone.      After a first period in which Giorgio was looking for his own style, he seemed to have found it in political songs that portrayed the society he was living in.      To Giorgio Gaber is dedicated the new subterranean auditorium of the Pirelli Tower, in Milan.      He died, after a long disease (cancer to the legs), the 1 January 2003 in his country house in Tuscany. He is buried in the Cimitero Monumentale in Milan.
