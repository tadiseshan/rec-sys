Steve “Luke” Lukather (born 21st October 1957 in San Fernando Valley, California) is a session musician, songwriter, arranger, producer and guitar player, best known for his work with pop/prog-rock band Toto. In addition to his work with Toto, Lukather has released several solo albums.      Lukather made himself famous by being the most sought-after session guitarist in LA in the 70s and 80s. He would walk into a studio last minute and lay down perfect tracks the first time, in whatever style required.      Known to his friends as “Luke” he still records and tours with Toto (2005) and continues to be an in-demand studio player and producer.      Influenced by the blues-rock pioneers such as Hendrix, and Jimmy Page, jazz guitarists such as Larry Carlton, and funk/fusion virtuosos such as Al Di Meola, Lukather’s style is unique. He is known for fast, melodic, yet bluesy lines. His vibrato is very pronounced and steady. In interviews, he explains how he thinks of the guitar in a ‘chordal cluster’ format, and not the typical linear ‘scale format’.      In addition to the high level of ability Steve Lukather has developed over the years, he also has built one of the largest effects rack of any rock guitarist. His tone is very ‘signature’, with a smooth overdrive/distortion, deep stereo delay, and all sorts of various effects on tap.
