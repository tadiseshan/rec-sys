Stephen (“Stevie”) Ray Vaughan, born in Dallas, Texas (October 3, 1954 – August 27, 1990) was an American blues guitar legend, and is known as one of the most influential [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) musicians in history.      Stevie Ray had been in numerous bands before joining [blues rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock) combo [Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Ray+Vaughan+and+Double+Trouble) in the late 1970’s.      [Stevie Ray Vaughan](http://www.srvofficial.com) and Double Trouble’s debut album was released in 1983. The critically acclaimed [Texas Flood](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Ray+Vaughan/Texas+Flood) (1983) featured the top-20 hit [Pride And Joy](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Ray+Vaughan/_/Pride+And+Joy) and sold well in both blues and rock circles.      Stevie Ray Vaughan died August 27th, 1990 when his helicopter crashed into the Alpine Valley ski hill. He was on his way back from playing a guest appearance at an Eric Clapton concert at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin.      Adult life and career      Vaughan’s first recording band was called Paul Ray and the Cobras. They played at clubs and bars in Austin during the mid-1970s, and released one single.[2] Vaughan later recorded two other singles under the band name The Cobras.[3] Stevie left the Cobras, leaving Denny Freeman still in his role of original lead guitarist, and formed Triple Threat in late 1975, which included bassist Jackie Newhouse, drummer Chris Layton, vocalist Lou Ann Barton, and sax player Johnny Reno. Barton left the band in 1978 to pursue a solo career, followed by Reno in 1979. The three remaining members started performing under the name Double Trouble, inspired by an Otis Rush song of the same name. Vaughan became the band’s lead singer.      Tommy Shannon, the bass player on Johnny Winter’s early albums, replaced Newhouse in 1981. A popular Austin act, Vaughan soon attracted the attention of musicians David Bowie and Jackson Browne. Both Browne and Bowie first caught Vaughan at the 1982 Montreux Jazz Festival, where some members of the audience booed the band because they disliked Double Trouble’s hard blues sound; the crowd response was quite different when they were subsequently invited to headline “Blues Night” at the festival in 1985.      In November, 1982, Vaughan recorded in Jackson Browne’s studio in downtown Los Angeles. The recordings were brought to the attention of A&R man John Hammond and became Double Trouble’s critically acclaimed first album, Texas Flood (1983), produced by Hammond; it featured the Top 20 hit “Pride and Joy” and sold 500,000 copies, earning the band a gold record. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award, and its song “Rude Mood” was nominated for “Best Rock Instrumental”. Vaughan won three categories in Guitar Player’s readers poll: “Best New Talent”, “Best Blues Album”, and “Best Electric Blues Guitarist”
