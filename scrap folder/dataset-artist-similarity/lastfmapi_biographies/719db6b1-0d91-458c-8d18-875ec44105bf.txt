**David Sylvian** (born, David Alan Batt, 23rd of February 1958, in Beckenham, Kent, UK) is an English singer, musician and [composer](http://www.last.fm/tag/composer) who first rose to fame as the lead vocalist and main songwriter of the band [Japan](http://www.last.fm/music/Japan), and whose subsequent solo career has been influenced by a variety of musical styles and genres, including [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz), [ambient](http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient) music and [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) music.      Japan - which also included [Mick Karn](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Karn), [Rob Dean](http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Dean), [Richard Barbieri](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Barbieri) and Sylvian’s brother [Steve Jansen](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Jansen) \- started out as a confusing hybrid rock/sleaze outfit in the mould of [David Bowie](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie) and [The New York Dolls](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+New+York+Dolls). Their music quickly evolved as, at least to begin with, they drew heavily on the influence of [Roxy Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music)’s [art rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/art%20rock) stylings. Their visual image developed in parallel and the band were (unwillingly) tagged as forerunners of the [new romantic](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20romantic) movement.      Japan recorded five studio albums between March 1978 and November 1981. Their biggest hit single, the minimalist [Ghosts](http://www.last.fm/music/Japan/_/Ghosts), which reached the Top 5 in the UK charts in 1982, was a clear pointer to Sylvian’s future direction. After a successful tour, the band split in late 1982, and Sylvian embarked upon a solo career.      Around the time of Sylvian’s first solo album he collaborated with [坂本龍一](http://www.last.fm/music/%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E9%BE%8D%E4%B8%80) (Ryuichi Sakamoto) on the soundtrack music for the Nagisa Oshima film _Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence_ (1983), which produced a Top 20 hit single, [Forbidden Colours]( http://www.last.fm/music/%E5%9D%82%E6%9C%AC%E9%BE%8D%E4%B8%80/_/Forbidden+Colo urs).      Sylvian’s debut solo album, the jazz and ambient-influenced _[Brilliant Trees](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Sylvian/Brilliant+Trees)_ (1984), met with critical acclaim and yielded the single [Red Guitar](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Sylvian/_/Red+Guitar), another Top 20 hit. Guest artists included [Jon Hassell](http://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Hassell) and [Holger Czukay](http://www.last.fm/music/Holger+Czukay). His follow-up was an instrumental EP _[Alchemy](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Sylvian/Alchemy)_ which cemented his drift away from commercial pop      The EP was in turn followed by the double album _[Gone To Earth](http://www.last
