Growing up in Royal Oak, Michigan, Frey became part of the mid-[60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s), Detroit rock scene. His first professional recording experience was performing acoustic guitar and background vocals on [Bob Seger](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Seger)’s songs “Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man” in 1968. Frey and Seger would remain friends and occasional songwriting partners in later years. Frey then moved to Los Angeles. His first recording as an artist was while fronting [Longbranch Pennywhistle](http://www.last.fm/music/Longbranch+Pennywhistle), a duo with [J.D.

After a stint in 1971 backing [Linda Ronstadt](http://www.last.fm/music/Linda+Ronstadt), Frey helped form Eagles, playing guitar and keyboards. Frey wrote or co-wrote (often with [Don Henley](http://www.last.fm/music/Don+Henley)) many of the group’s songs, and sang lead vocal on a number of Eagles hits such as “Take It Easy,” “Tequila Sunrise,” “Lyin’ Eyes,” “New Kid in Town,” and “Heartache Tonight”.
