M.O.P., short for _Mash-Out Posse_, is an American [hip hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip%20hop) group from Brooklyn, New York. Comprised of rappers [Lil’ Fame](http://www.last.fm/music/Lil%27+Fame) aka Fizzy Womack and [Billy Danze](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Danze), the group is best known for frenetic singles such as 2000’s [Ante Up (Robbin Hoodz Theory)](http://www.last.fm/music/M.O.P./_/Ante+Up+\(Robbin+Hoodz+Theory\)).      Throughout their whole career M.O.P. deliver the most hard, vicious and violent music hip hop could ever offer. They struck out in 1994. with [To the Death](http://www.last.fm/music/M.O.P./To+the+Death), a dark, slow and raging LP that was fully produced by DR Period and featured one of the biggest hardcore [rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/rap) anthems of the nineties, [How About Some Hardcore](http://www.last.fm/music/M.O.P./_/How+About+Some+Hardcore), that’s put by any hardcore rap fan in the same category with [Onyx](http://www.last.fm/music/Onyx)’s [Slam](http://www.last.fm/music/Onyx/_/Slam), [Jeru the Damaja](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeru+the+Damaja)’s [Come Clean](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeru+the+Damaja/_/Come+Clean) and [Wu-Tang Clan](http://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan)’s [Shame on a Nigga](http://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan/_/Shame+on+a+Nigga).      In 1996 MOP released their second effort, the totally-sophomore-slump-free [Firing Squad](http://www.last.fm/music/M.O.P./Firing+Squad). Despite totally changing their production sources (the album was mostly produced by [Gang Starr](http://www.last.fm/music/Gang+Starr)’s [DJ Premier](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Premier) and Fizzy Womack himself), M.O.P. continued torturing fans’ ears with extremely hard, rhinocerously slow beats and ecstatic, rampant delivery. Subject matter is either battling with heavy use of criminal associations or serious talk about life in the ghetto.      Two years later M.O.P. hit the fans with a starter - an EP called [Handle Ur Bizness](http://www.last.fm/music/M.O.P./Handle+Ur+Bizness) and later that year released [First Family 4 Life](http://www.last.fm/music/M.O.P./First+Family+4+Life), working on the same formula as ever, again with heavy percentage of DJ Preemo’s production, more gems produced by group member Lil Fame and proving that M.O.P.’s trademark is not only the hardest hardcore you can get but also consistency.      Most of M.O.P.’s work was considered underground until 2000, when they released [Warriorz](http://www.last.fm/music/M.O.P./Warriorz), their best work yet. Mainstream got the first hint with “Ante Up”, a track produced by DR Period for first time in 6 years. But with self-produced [Cold As Ice](http://www.last.fm/music/M.O.P./_/Cold+As+Ice), a track that featured a rock-song sample (Cold As Ice by [Foreigner](http://www.last.fm/music/Foreigner)), M.O.P
