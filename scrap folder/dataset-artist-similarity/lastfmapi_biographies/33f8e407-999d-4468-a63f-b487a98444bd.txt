**The Rutles** is a [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) group from London, England. A spoof of the massively popular and influential rock group [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles), The Rutles was the brainchild of [Neil Innes](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Innes), former member of [The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bonzo+Dog+Doo-Dah+Band), and ex-[Monty Python](http://www.last.fm/music/Monty+Python) member [Eric Idle](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Idle). The four official members of The Rutles were [Dirk McQuickly](http://www.last.fm/music/Dirk+McQuickly) (Eric Idle), [Ron Nasty](http://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Nasty) (Neil Innes), Stig O’Hara (Ricky Fataar) and Barry Wom (John Halsey), parodies of [Paul McCartney](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney), [John Lennon](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon), [George Harrison](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison) and [Ringo Starr](http://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Starr), respectively. However, Eric Idle did not contribute to the actual musical recordings. The “Paul” vocals were performed by Ollie Halsall, who was glimpsed shortly in the mockumentary The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash as “Leppo,” the “fifth Rutle.” Idle lipsynced to the music skits featured in the film.      The Rutles originated as a sketch filmed for Idle’s _Rutland Weekend Television_ in the mid-1970’s, albeit with a different cast of characters: Idle, for instance, portrayed the character “Dirk,” which was at that time the parody equivalent of George Harrison, not Paul McCartney. The sketch was originally aired on _Saturday Night Live_; producer Lorne Michaels enjoyed the sketch so much that he produced a TV movie that became known as _The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash_, a mockumentary which is regarded as a precursor to such films as _This Is [Spinal Tap](http://www.last.fm/music/Spinal+Tap)_. The film parodied all aspects of The Beatles’ career, such as the _[Yellow Submarine](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Yellow+Submarine)_ animated film and the “Paul is Dead” rumors. Ex-Beatle George Harrison, a fan of Monty Python (and later executive producer for Monty Python’s _Life of Brian_) appeared as a reporter interviewing the press manager for The Rutles, played by Idle’s Monty Python colleague Michael Palin. Originally aired on television in 1978, the film was ignored upon its initial release, but became a home video sales success.      Neil Innes, under the pseudonym Nasty/McQuickly (a parody of Lennon/McCartney, whom a majority of Beatles compositions are attributed to), wrote all The Rutles’ songs, borrowing heavily from Beatles riffs, chord formations, and lyrics. Additionally, songs were also written using the pseudonyms of Stig O’Hara and Barry Wom. Their first studio album, _[The Rutles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rutles/The+Rutles)_, was released as the soundtrack for _All You Need Is Cash_ in 1978
