There are 3 artists with this name, 1. Experimental artist Louis Hardin, 2. A project of [Walter Schreifels](http://www.last.fm/music/Walter+Schreifels), 3. A short lived band fronted by [James Freud](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Freud) formerly of [Models](http://www.last.fm/music/Models).      1) Moondog was the pseudonym of Louis T. Hardin (May 26, 1916 – September 8, 1999).      He was a New York City street musician and former beat poet who was blinded as a young adult. From the late 1940s until 1974, he was a permanent fixture, busking on 54th Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan. He was known not only for his music and poetry, but also for the distinctive Viking garb that he wore, including a horned helmet. He routinely gave away copies of his work to anybody who would take them. In this way, he came to the attention of producer James William Guercio, who took him into the studio to record an album, released as “_[Moondog](http://www.last.fm/music/Moondog/Moondog)_” (1969) on the CBS label. The track [Stamping Ground](http://www.last.fm/music/Moondog/_/Stamping+Ground), with its odd preamble of **Moondog** saying one of his epigrams, was featured on the sampler double album “_Fill Your Head with Rock_”. A brief phrase of another track on the album, [Bird’s Lament](http://www.last.fm/music/Moondog/_/Bird%27s+Lament) (In memory of [Charlie Parker](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker)) was sampled by [Mr. Scruff](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Scruff) as the basis for his 7-minute track [Get a Move On](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Scruff/_/Get+a+Move+On)      A second album produced with Guercio, and featuring both himself and his daughter as vocalists, contained song compositions in the forms of canons and rounds. It did not make an impression on popular music as the first had. The two CBS albums were re-released as a single CD in 1989.      In a search for new sounds, **Moondog** also invented several musical instruments, such as the “Oo”, a small triangular shaped harp, and the “Trimba”, a triangular percussion instrument invented in the late 40s. The Original Trimba today is still played by [Stefan Lakatos](http://www.last.fm/music/Stefan+Lakatos), Swedish percussionist, close friend and pupil of **Moondog**, who also taught him how to build the instrument.      **Moondog** had an idealised view of Germany (“The Holy Land with the Holy River” — the Rhine), where he settled in 1974. A young German student named Ilona Goebel accommodated him, first in Oer-Erkenschwick, and later on in Muenster in Westphalia, Germany, where he spent the remainder of his life.      **Moondog** visited America in 1989, at the invitation of the New Music America Festival in Brooklyn, stimulating a renewed interest in his music.      He recorded many albums, and toured both in the US and in Europe — France, Germany and Sweden
