He has also organized and produced recordings with master musicians from around the world, having logged extensive travel in Morocco and West Africa, India, Japan, Cuba, Australia, Brazil, and numerous other locations throughout Asia, Africa and South America. In the United States and abroad, his name has become synonymous with a commitment to creativity, integrity and daring — whether in the recording studio or on stage — that has earned him the respect (and often lifelong friendship) of all the artists with whom he has worked.      Bill Laswell was born in Salem, Illinois in 1955 and fell into music originally for social rather than aesthetic reasons; he has often been quoted as saying “a band was like a gang.” He started on guitar but soon switched to electric bass, and in his earliest groups played soul and funk music inspired by the likes of [James Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown) and [Johnny “Guitar” Watson](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+%22Guitar%22+Watson). In the early ’70s he toured the “chitlin circuit” with cover bands that played [Al Green](http://www.last.fm/music/Al+Green), [O’Jays](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/O%27Jays) and [Meters](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Meters) material, while back home he was constantly making pilgrimages to Detroit for live performances of groups as diverse as [The Stooges](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stooges), [The MC5](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+MC5) and [Parliament- Funkadelic](http://www.last.fm/music/Parliament-Funkadelic) — sometimes all on the same stage. Laswell was deeply into Black music but was also absorbing the tenets of protopunk and rock; the rhythmic assurance and aggressiveness that are the cornerstone of virtually all his work have their genesis in this early training.
