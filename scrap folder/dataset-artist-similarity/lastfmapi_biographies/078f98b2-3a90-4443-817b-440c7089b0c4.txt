**Irwin Goodman** (real name: Antti Yrjö Hammarberg, 14 September 1943, Hämeenlinna – 14 January 1991, Hamina) was a popular Finnish singer.   He recorded over 200 songs, most of which were his own compositions, with lyrics written by [Vexi Salmi](http://www.last.fm/music/Vexi+Salmi) (Alias Emil “von” Retee).   Irwin Goodman started as a protest song singer in the folk boom of the mid- 1960s,   his humorous songs often mocking any authorities becoming evergreens among Finnish people.   Irwin got into continuing troubles with Finnish tax authorities, had ever- worsening problems with alcohol,   and his escapades were eagerly followed by such sensationalist magazines as [Hymy](http://www.hymy.fi/).
