**Swing Out Sister** are a British pop musical group best known worldwide for their 1986 hit single [Breakout](http://www.last.fm/music/Swing+Out+Sister/_/Breakout).      The group presently comprises [Andy Connell](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Connell) (born Andrew John Connell, Jul 26, 1961, Nottingham; keyboards) and [Corinne Drewery](http://www.last.fm/music/Corinne+Drewery) (born Sep 21, 1959, Nottingham; vocals), though it began as a trio in the [United Kingdom](http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom). The group was initially formed by Connell and Martin Jackson (drums), in 1985 who were later joined by Drewery. The group’s name came from a 1945 movie called _Swing Out, Sister_, and they reportedly chose the name because there was only one thing they could agree on: they all hated it! Both Connell and Jackson had been playing in other bands prior to forming SOS, while Drewery was actually a fashion designer and model before she became the band’s lead vocalist and lyricist.      **_It’s Better To Travel_ (1987, debut album)**   Together with their producer, Paul Staveley O’Duffy, they signed with [Mercury Records Limited](http://www.last.fm/label/Mercury+Records+Limited). Prior to their first album, they released the single [Blue Mood](http://www.last.fm/music/Swing+Out+Sister/_/Blue+Mood) in the UK in November 1985. However, it did not chart. In late 1986, the single “Breakout” was released. It peaked at #4 on the UK charts, and #6 in the [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States). Consequently, when they released their debut album, _[It’s Better To Travel](http://www.last.fm/music/Swing+Out+Sister/It%27s+Better+To+Travel)_, on May 11, 1987, it reached #1 on the UK album charts.      The album registered with listeners for its mix of [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) and [electropop](http://www.last.fm/tag/electropop), a genre often also referred to as [sophisti-pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/sophisti-pop), with a blend of real horns, synths (arranged subtly, to sound like strings), drums, and xylophones, scored by producer-arranger Richard Niles. The follow-up single to the effervescent “Breakout” was the brooding [Surrender](http://www.last.fm/music/Swing+Out+Sister/_/Surrender), which featured a trumpet solo performed by John Thirkell. It rose to #7 on the UK charts in January 1987. The next single was the more serious and jazzy [Twilight World](http://www.last.fm/music/Swing+Out+Sister/_/Twilight+World). This song was the subject of many remixes and was a dance club favorite worldwide. The final single [Fooled By A Smile](http://www.last.fm/music/Swing+Out+Sister/_/Fooled+By+A+Smile) returned to the upbeat pop orientation characteristic of “Breakout”.      The group was subsequently nominated for two American Grammy Awards in 1988: Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Group or Duo (for “Breakout”)
