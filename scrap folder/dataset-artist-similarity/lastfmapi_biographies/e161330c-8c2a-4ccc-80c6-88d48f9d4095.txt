**Chris Montez** (born January 17, 1943) is a Mexican-American [singer](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer). Initially known as a [rock n roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20n%20roll) artist, Montez became one of the most important [chicano](http://www.last.fm/tag/chicano) rockers following the tragic passing of [Ritchie Valens](http://www.last.fm/music/Ritchie+Valens), his mentor. Montez had a #4 hit in the US with the 1962 single “[Let’s Dance](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Montez/_/Let%27s+Dance)”. Later, he was reinvented as a middle of the road [easy listening](http://www.last.fm/tag/easy%20listening) singer, boasting a slew of Hot 100/Adult Contemporary crossover hits, predominantly renditions of [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) standards such as “[The More I See You](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Montez/_/The+More+I+See+You)”, “[There Will Never Be Another You](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Montez/_/There+Will+Never+Be+Another+You)”, and “[Time After Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Montez/_/Time+After+Time)”.      Born Ezekiel Christopher Montanez in Los Angeles, California, Montez was brought up in Hawthorne, California. His early musical influences included the [latino](http://www.last.fm/tag/latino) music played and performed by residents of his neighborhood, as well as Ritchie Valens. After the release of the highly successful “Let’s Dance” on [Monogram Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Monogram+Records), Montez spent several years touring with artists such as [Sam Cooke](http://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Cooke), [The Platters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Platters), and [Smokey Robinson and The Miracles](http://www.last.fm/music/Smokey+Robinson+and+The+Miracles), as well as [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles), then relatively unknown outside of Liverpool.      Early in 1963, Montez would score another hit with “[Some Kinda Fun](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Montez/_/Some+Kinda+Fun)”. Reaching #43 on the charts, the song utilized the same catchy keyboard instrumentation as did “Let’s Dance”; fittingly, both were million sellers, and were awarded gold discs. 1963 also saw the release of Montez’s only album on Monogram, _[Let’s Dance and Have Some Kinda’ Fun!!!](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Montez/Let%2 7s+Dance+and+Have+Some+Kinda%27+Fun!!!)_. Shortly before Monogram folded, Montez was paired up with [Kathy Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Kathy+Young), releasing two singles as the duo [Chris & Kathy](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+&+Kathy), most notably [surf rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/surf%20rock) classic “[Shoot That Curl](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+&+Kathy/_/Shoot+That+Curl)”. While at Monogram, Montez wrote, or co-wrote, several of his own songs, such as “[Chiquita Mia](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Montez/_/Chiquita+Mia)”, “[Let’s Do the Limbo](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Montez/_/Let%27s+Do+the+Limbo)” and “[No No No](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Montez/_/No+No+No)”
