Early life      Max Pezzali was born on the 14th November 1967 in Pavia, Italy. His parents owned a florists near the family home. During his high school years Pezzali was held back for one year because he did not achieve the required pass grades. It was in this class that he would meet his best friend and future band mate, Mauro Repetto. Pezzali and Repetto both shared a love for rock and roll music and it was this which led to the initial idea of starting a band. Together they went on holiday to China. During their stay they purchased a cheap synthesizer, and on their return to Pavia, immediately began writing music with it.      883      Being a big fan of motorbikes, especially “Harley Davidsons”, it was decided to name the group 883, after one of the models of these motorbikes. Pezzali and Repetto started their singing career at the famous Castrocaro Festival, in 1991, with the song “Hanno Ucciso L’Uomo Ragno”, and became popular the next year. In 1994 Repetto left the band on good terms to pursue his dream of becoming a movie director in America. The band continued without him until 2002 when Pezzali anounced his plans to begin a solo career and to take full credit for his songs. During their career (1992 - 2002), “883” published 9 studio albums, released over 25 music videos and frequently toured Italy.      Solo career      In 2002 Pezzali began work on his first solo album which was released in 2004. His style of writing differed very little from his music with “883”. The main themes in his songs were still friendship, honesty, and relationships. In 2005 an “883” and “Max Pezzali” greatest hits album was released which included a DVD with all the music videos to date. His latest album, “Time Out”, was released during the summer of 2007. It proved a great success with the most popular songs remaining at the top of the charts throughout the summer. Pezzali is well accepted by his fans for his friendly approach, great stage performances, and his commitment to his music.
