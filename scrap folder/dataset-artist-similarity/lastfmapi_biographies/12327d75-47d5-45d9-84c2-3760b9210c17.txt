Roger Keith “Syd” Barrett (born 6 January 1946 in Cambridge, England; died 7 July 2006 in Cambridge, England) was an English musician, singer, songwriter, guitarist, and painter, best remembered as a founder member of the legendary rock band [Pink Floyd](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd). He was the lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter during the band’s psychedelic years, providing major musical and stylistic direction in their early work; he is also credited with naming the band. Barrett left the group in April 1968 amid speculations of mental illness exacerbated by drug use.      Barrett’s innovative guitar work and exploration of experimental techniques such as using dissonance, distortion, and feedback had an enormous legacy, with a wide variety of musicians from David Bowie to Brian Eno to Jimmy Page and more drawing influence. In his post-musician life, Barrett continued with his painting and dedicated himself to gardening, never to return to the public eye. A number of biographies have been written since the 1980s, and Pink Floyd wrote and recorded several tributes to him after he left, most notably the 1975 track “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”.      Barrett acquired the nickname “Syd” at the age of fifteen, a reference to an old local Cambridge drummer, Sid Barrett. Syd changed the spelling in order to differentiate himself from his namesake. Starting in 1964, the band that would become Pink Floyd underwent various line-up and name changes such as “The Abdabs”, “The Screaming Abdabs”, “Sigma 6”, and “The Meggadeaths”. In 1965, Barrett joined them as The Tea Set (sometimes spelled T-Set), and when they found themselves playing a concert with a band of the same name, Barrett came up with the name “The Pink Floyd Sound” (also known as “The Pink Floyd Blues Band”, later “The Pink Floyd”), possibly after two obscure [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues)men, [Pink Anderson](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Anderson) and [Floyd Council](http://www.last.fm/music/Floyd+Council). While the band began by playing cover versions of American R&B songs (much in the same vein as contemporaries [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones), [The Yardbirds](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Yardbirds), and [The Kinks](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks)), they carved out their own style of improvised rock and roll by 1966, which drew as much from improvised jazz as it did from British [pop-rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop-rock), such as that championed by [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles). In that year, a new rock concert venue, the UFO, opened in London and quickly became a haven for British [psychedelic](http://www.last.fm/tag/psychedelic) music. Pink Floyd became their most popular attraction, and, after making appearances at the rival Roundhouse, became the most popular musical group of the so-called London Underground psychedelic music scene
