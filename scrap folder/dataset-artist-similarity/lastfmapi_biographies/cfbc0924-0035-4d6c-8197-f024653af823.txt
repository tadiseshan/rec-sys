Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones, more commonly known as Nas (formerly Nasty Nas and Escobar), born September 14, 1973 in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York, is a prominent American MC. The son of jazz musician [Olu Dara](http://www.last.fm/music/Olu+Dara), he was raised in the infamous Queensbridge housing projects in Queensbridge, New York. According to the [Nasty Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=23248), as a teenager rapper, Nasir first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas. By the time he released his landmark solo debut album [Illmatic](http://www.last.fm/music/Nas/Illmatic) in 1994, Jones was known as Nas.      Illmatic was a critically acclaimed bestseller and is widely considered one of the greatest rap albums of all time. He married R&B singer [Kelis](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelis) in 2005, they have one son together, and she filed for divorce on the 29th of April 2009. Nas was also a part of hip hop supergroup [The Firm](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Firm), which released one album.      In the years following the release of _Illmatic_, Nas pursued a more [commercial](http://www.last.fm/tag/commercial) direction, which resulted in wider success but decreased artistic credibility among critics and hip-hop purists. Furthermore, Nas’ increased commercial success was accompanied by stylistic changes that fostered accusations of “selling out”. Nevertheless, the LP [Stillmatic](http://www.last.fm/music/Nas/Stillmatic) is often credited for restoring Nas’ credibility among fans. Since the success of _Stillmatic_, Nas continues to maintain a high profile within the hip hop community, and has pursued a decidedly progressive and personal aesthetic. While Nas’ current artistic direction differs greatly from his most successful work, it has ensured that he remains one of the most respected and acclaimed contemporary rappers.      **1973–1992: Childhood and early career**      Nas was born in [Brooklyn](http://www.last.fm/tag/brooklyn), [New York](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20york), as the elder of Olu Dara and Fannie Ann Jones’s two children; his brother Jabari (nicknamed “[Jungle](http://www.last.fm/music/Jungle)” because he was born in the [Congo](http://www.last.fm/place/Congo)) is the younger of the two. The family lived for a time in Brooklyn, before moving to Queensbridge, the largest public housing project in the [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States). Olu Dara left the household in 1986, when Nas was 13, and Ann Jones raised her two boys on her own. Nas dropped out of school in the eighth grade and began selling drugs on the streets of New York. He educated himself, reading about [African](http://www.last.fm/tag/african) culture and civilization, the Qur’an, the Bible and the [Five Percent Nation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Percent_Nation).
