Tuomari Nurmio is the artist name of Hannu Nurmio (b. 1950 in Helsinki), a Finnish rock singer and songwriter.      Since his debut album, Nurmio has been regarded as one of the most original Finnish singer-songwriters. His lyrics are filled with peculiar and arresting metaphors and expressions, some of which have made their way into the vernacular Finnish language. Especially the first four albums are now seen as classic works.      Musically the first albums draw on the traditions of American country, blues and roots music, combining them with new wave quirkiness and energy. The lyrics have a romantic, humorous undertones, with occasional glimpses of the dark side of urban life. In the 1990s Nurmio’s sound has moved towards a scratchy, rugged sound somewhat reminiscent of Tom Waits. In the 2000s he has often performed in a duo with a guitar and Markku Hillilä playing drums. In 2007 a collaboration named [Tuomari Nurmio & Kongontien Orkesteri](http://www.last.fm/music/Tuomari+Nurmio+&+Kongontien+Orkesteri) released the Album “Tangomanifesti”. One of his recent collaborations is that with the band [Alamaailman Vasarat](http://www.last.fm/music/Alamaailman+Vasarat).      About his nick name -   “Tuomari” means a judge in Finnish. Nurmio adopted this nickname, since he has a higher degree in law and could theoretically work as a judge
