Emerging from the English-Indian underground, Sean’s first album featured [political](http://www.last.fm/tag/political) content as well as emotional songwriting baring his personal insecurities and struggles, all of it drawing influence from the traditional pop music of India (such as [bhangra](http://www.last.fm/tag/bhangra)). Released 8 November 2004 in the U.K., January 2005 in Malaysia, and February 2005 in India on 2Point9 Records, Relentless Records, and Virgin Records, ‘_[Me Against Myself](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Sean/Me+Against+Myself)_’ achieved highly supportive critical reviews, with Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music praising Sean’s work as “an album of phenomenally accomplished R&B”. His release was certified as multi-platinum in his native India and gold in the U.K. His three singles (composed with help from Sean’s mentor [Rishi Rich](http://www.last.fm/music/Rishi+Rich)) also met with British chart success: “[Dance With You](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Sean/_/Dance+With+You)” (#12), “[Eyes on You](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Sean/_/Eyes+on+You)” (#6), and “[Stolen](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Sean/_/Stolen)” (#4).      Sean’s touring, as well as the success of his singles in clubs, led Tareck Ghoneim of Contactmusic.com to call Sean an “Asian sensation”. Still, he had his eyes on breaking into the U.S. while also keeping his stride with the U.K. charts, and he wanted as well to incorporate more of a slick pop sound to his coming work. His sophomore release, ‘_[My Own Way](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Sean/My+Own+Way)_’, featured him on the cover looking as dapper in his light brown suit as a master of business
