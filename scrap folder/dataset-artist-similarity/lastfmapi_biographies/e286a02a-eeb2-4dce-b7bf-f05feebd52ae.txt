The Bothy Band was an Irish traditional band from the 1970s, one of the most prominent from the roots revival of that era. Its members were: [Matt Molloy](http://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Molloy) \- flute and tin whistle; [Paddy Keenan](http://www.last.fm/music/Paddy+Keenan) \- uillean pipes and tin whistle; [Dónal Lunny](http://www.last.fm/music/D%C3%B3nal+Lunny) \- bouzouki, guitar, and production; [Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill](http://www.last.fm/music/Tr%C3%ADona+N%C3%AD+Dhomhnaill) \- harpsichord, clavinet and vocals; and [Mícheál Ó Domhnaill](http://www.last.fm/music/M%C3%ADche%C3%A1l+%C3%93+Domhnaill) \- guitar and vocals. The initial lineup had [Paddy Glackin](http://www.last.fm/music/Paddy+Glackin) on fiddle as well as [Tony Mac Mahon](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Tony+Mac+Mahon) on accordion. The band turned professional in November of 1975, with [Tommy Peoples](http://www.last.fm/music/Tommy+Peoples) replacing Glackin on fiddle, to be replaced in turn by [Kevin Burke](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Burke) in May of 1976.      Their eponymous first album from 1975 (re-released as [1975: The First Album](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bothy+Band/1975:+The+First+Album)) established their critical renown. Their second, [Old Hag You Have Killed Me](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bothy+Band/Old+Hag+You+Have+Killed+Me), from 1976, only increased their audience. This was followed by [Out Of The Wind Into The Sun](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bothy+Band/Out+Of+The+Wind+Into+The+Sun). That was to be their last studio release, however, and it was followed by a live album recorded in Paris, [Afterhours](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bothy+Band/Afterhours). In 1994 some previously unreleased concerts from 1976 & 1978 were released as [Live in Concert](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bothy+Band/Live+in+Concert). After the band’s dissolution, the various members joined such bands as [Nightnoise](http://www.last.fm/music/Nightnoise), [Moving Hearts](http://www.last.fm/music/Moving+Hearts), [The Chieftains](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chieftains), [Patrick Street](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrick+Street) and [Touchstone](http://www.last.fm/music/Touchstone).
