The group disbanded when Thorn decided to concentrate on [Everything But the Girl](http://www.last.fm/music/Everything+But+the+Girl).      Thorn’s first solo work was a solo mini-album in 1982 entitled _[A Distant Shore](http://www.last.fm/music/Tracey+Thorn/A+Distant+Shore)_. A re-recorded version of the track [Plain Sailing](http://www.last.fm/music/Tracey+Thorn/_/Plain+Sailing) was released as a single, and was included on the ‘Pillows & Prayers’ Cherry Red records compilation album.      Thorn and [Ben Watt](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Watt) met at University when they were both signed separately, as solo artists, to [Cherry Red](http://www.last.fm/label/Cherry+Red) Records.
