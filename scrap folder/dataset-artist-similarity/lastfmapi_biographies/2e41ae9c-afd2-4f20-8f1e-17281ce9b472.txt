Since 1986 she fronts the [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band [No Doubt](http://www.last.fm/music/No+Doubt), whose 1995 release _[Tragic Kingdom](http://www.last.fm/music/No+Doubt/Tragic+Kingdom)_ \- which spawned the singles [Just a Girl](http://www.last.fm/music/No+Doubt/_/Just+a+Girl), [Spiderwebs](http://www.last.fm/music/No+Doubt/_/Spiderwebs), and [Don’t Speak](http://www.last.fm/music/No+Doubt/_/Don%27t+Speak) \- propelled them into stardom with sales of 16 million copies worldwide.       In 2004, Stefani released her first solo album _[Love. Angel. Music. Baby.](http://www.last.fm/music/Gwen+Stefani/Love.+Angel.+Music.+Baby.)_ The album featured several collaborations with producers and other artists, including No Doubt bandmate [Tony Kanal](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Kanal), [Linda Perry](http://www.last.fm/music/Linda+Perry), [André 3000](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Andr%C3%A9+3000), [Nellee Hooper](http://www.last.fm/music/Nellee+Hooper), and [The Neptunes](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Neptunes). It was primarily inspired by [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) and [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) music of the 1980s, and emerged an international success with sales of over seven million copies. The third single [Hollaback Girl](http://www.last.fm/music/Gwen+Stefani/_/Hollaback+Girl) became the first U.S. digital download to sell one million copies.      The debut album also drew attention to the Harajuku Girls, Stefani’s entourage of four Japanese backup dancers named for the fashionable suburb in Tokyo. Originally hired in 2004 for the album, the Girls continued to appear alongside Stefani, and are featured in these music videos: “[What You Waiting For?](http://www.gwenstefani.com/player/default.aspx?mid=33)”, “[Rich Girl](http://www.gwenstefani.com/player/default.aspx?mid=34)”, “[Hollaback Girl](http://www.gwenstefani.com/player/default.aspx?mid=35)”, “[Luxurious](http://www.gwenstefani.com/player/default.aspx?mid=1306)”, “[Crash](http://www.gwenstefani.com/player/default.aspx?mid=37)”, “[Wind It Up](http://www.gwenstefani.com/player/default.aspx?mid=744)”, “[The Sweet Escape](http://www.gwenstefani.com/player/default.aspx?mid=743)”, and “[Now That You Got It](http://www.gwenstefani.com/player/default.aspx?mid=723)”.
