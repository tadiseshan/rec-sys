Gary Moore (born April 4, 1952 as Robert William Gary Moore in Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom; died February 6, 2011 in Malaga, Spain) is acknowledged as one of the finest guitarists to have originated in Ireland. He was a virtuoso guitarist and is considered by his fans to be one of the best guitar players ever.      In a career dating back to the 1960s he has played with bands including [Thin Lizzy](http://www.last.fm/music/Thin+Lizzy), [Colosseum II](http://www.last.fm/music/Colosseum+II), [Greg Lake](http://www.last.fm/music/Greg+Lake) and [Skid Row](http://www.last.fm/music/Skid+Row) as well as having a successful solo career.      Moore started performing from a young age and got his first good guitar at the age of 14. In a career lasting over 30 years he has demonstrated that he is a fine musician, and his unique style of playing has adapted to very different music genres, including jazz rock jazz, blues, electric blues, hard rock, celtic rock and heavy metal.      One of his most famous non-blues records is Wild Frontier, his first studio album after a trip back to his native Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1985, this album has several songs about Ireland and even the music itself is steeped in Celtic roots. The title track was intended to be sung by Phil Lynott, however Lynott’s death in January 1986 prevented that. The album is dedicated to Lynott’s memory, with the words “For Philip” on the rear cover.      Wild Frontier contains the hit “Over the Hills and Far Away”, which reached #20 in the UK as well as a cover of the Australian band The Easybeats’ hit of the middle of the 1960s, “Friday on My Mind”. The Max Middleton-penned “The Loner” was originally recorded by Cozy Powell for his Over the Top album in 1979 (which Moore did perform on, albeit not on Powell’s recording of “The Loner”), but was substantially altered by Moore for his own recording, thus he was credited as a co-writer.      For blues fans, Moore’s best recorded, live performance on video is “LIVE BLUES” recorded in a small night club in London and was released in 1992 on VHS. It is now available on DVD as well. “LIVE BLUES” also features two songs with [B.B. King](http://www.last.fm/music/B.B.+King) appearing on stage with Moore. “The Thrill Is Gone” on this recording is probably the best version of this, complete with More’s Midnight Horns, female backup singers and dueling guitars. Many of Moore’s standard songs are on this 90 minute show and were mixed better than most of the studio versions of the same tunes for a very rich and full sound. Even Moore’s voice sounds better than it usually does in the studio. Moore does not seem interested in touring the United States.      Connection with [Peter Green](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Green)      According to numerous interviews he has given to guitar magazines, he was the protege of British Blues pioneer Peter Green, whom he had always admired ever since the Bluesbreakers days
