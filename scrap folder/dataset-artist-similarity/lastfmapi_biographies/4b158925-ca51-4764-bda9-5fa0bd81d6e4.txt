Florent Marchet is a Paris-based French singer-songwriter, originally from the rural area of Berry.      His first LP ‘Gargilesse’ was published in 2005. It was named after his hometown in Berry. ‘Gargilesse’ was widely praised by the French critic, rarely enthusiastic with newcomers.      His second album ‘Rio Baril’ was released in early 2007 to mixed reviews. Most reviewers regretted that Marchet was just repeating ‘Gargilesse’ in a slightly less interesting manner, despite ‘Rio Baril’ being a concept album about a fictional village in the countryside.      His songs blend british-influenced tunes and bittersweet or sometimes cynic lyrics (in French) about the boredom of the countryside, the loneliness of the big cities and the melancholy of being a thirtysomething, exploring thus Marchet’s intimate universe.      Marchet’s voice and singing technique strangely recall French veteran singer Alain Souchon’s, but Marchet’s songs point to another direction of the French singer-songwriter scene.
