**Lisa Germano** is a multi-instrumentalist, singer, writer and arranger from Mishawaka, Indiana.      After years playing violin as a session musician with the likes of **[John Mellencamp](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Mellencamp)**, **[Indigo Girls](http://www.last.fm/music/Indigo+Girls)** and **[Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan)**, Germano embarked on a solo career in 1991 with the understated but occasionally brilliant _[On the Way Down From the Moon Palace](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Germano/On+the+Way+Do wn+From+the+Moon+Palace)_ on her own label, which led to a deal with [Capitol](http://www.last.fm/label/Capitol), who released her second album. Although _[Happiness](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Germano/Happiness)_ was a massive step up in terms of confidence and songwriting, troubles at the label led to her buying back the rights. In 1994 [4AD](http://www.last.fm/label/4AD) released a re-sequenced and remixed version of _[Happiness](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Germano/Happiness)_ with a new sleeve and a few different tracks (including a gloomy version of the formerly scintillating ‘… Dresses’).      She turned out to be not just a great musician (she plays most of the instruments: piano, guitar, percussion and tape effects, as well as her trademark violin) and a wittily melancholy if kooky songwriter (‘I Love A Snot’, indeed), but a phenomenal arranger whose innovation and breadth of expression is comparable to **[PJ Harvey](http://www.last.fm/music/PJ+Harvey)** at her tape-mangling best.      As her style developed, so the music’s potential commercial appeal increased without compromising its uniqueness. Bright kaleidoscopes during an otherwise dark time in 4AD’s history, the following three albums, _[Geek the Girl](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Germano/Geek+the+Girl)_, _[Excerpts from a Love Circus](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Germano/Excerpts+from+a+Love+Circus)_ and _[Slide](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Germano/Slide)_ all won critical acclaim, but sadly failed to reach the wide audience they deserved; Germano was dropped in 1998, and announced her retirement from the music business.      (In 1997, she also released a collaboration with **[Giant Sand](http://www.last.fm/music/Giant+Sand)** and future members of **[Calexico](http://www.last.fm/music/Calexico)** under the name **[OP8](http://www.last.fm/music/OP8) Featuring The Ilk Of Lisa Germano**).      Retirement didn’t suit her, and she was soon out on tour again, sessioning for **[David Bowie](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie)** and **[Neil Finn](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Finn)**, before, in 2003, releasing the self-funded _[lullaby for liquid pig](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Germano/lullaby+for+liquid+pig)_ on ArtistDIRECT imprint [Ineffable](http://www.last.fm/label/Ineffable). A return to the woozy, after-the-carnival soundworld of _…Love Circus_, the album was made with help from collaborators Finn, **[Johnny Marr](http://www.last
