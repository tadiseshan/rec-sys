Belinda Carlisle (born August 17, 1958 in Hollywood, California) is the lead vocalist and a founding member of the all-female New Wave band Go-Go’s. She is also a successful solo artist.      A former high school cheerleader, Carlisle is the eldest of seven children.      **Early Career and The Go-Go’s**      Carlisle’s first venture into music was a brief stint as drummer for the punk band The Germs under the name Dottie Danger, although illness prevented her from ever performing with them live. Soon after leaving this band she founded the Go-Go’s (originally named [The Misfits](http://www.last.fm/group/The+Misfits)) with friend and fellow music novice [Jane Wiedlin](http://www.last.fm/music/Jane+Wiedlin). With bassist- turned-guitarist [Charlotte Caffey](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Caffey), guitarist-turned-bassist [Kathy Valentine](http://www.last.fm/music/Kathy+Valentine), and drummer [Gina Schock](http://www.last.fm/music/Gina+Schock), the Go-Go’s became one of the most successful American bands of the early 80’s, helping to usher “new wave music” into popular American radio and becoming the first all-female band in rock history to achieve a #1 album, who also wrote their own music and played their own instruments. The Go-Go’s recorded two more studio albums (including [VACATION](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Go+Go%27s/VACATION), which went gold thanks to the title track). “Head over Heels,” from the album [Talk Show](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Go+Go%27s/Talk+Show), made it to #11, but they never repeated the success of their multi-platinum debut, [Beauty and the Beat](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Go+Go%27s/Beauty+and+the+Beat), which featured the hits “[We Got the Beat](http://www.last.fm/music/Belinda+Carlisle/_/We+Got+the+Beat)” and “[Our Lips Are Sealed](http://www.last.fm/music/Belinda+Carlisle/_/Our+Lips+Are+Sealed)”.      The antics of the Go-Go’s in the early- to mid-1980s contrasted with their public image. Since then, the group’s notoriety from that time period had become something of a legend, involving drugs and sex. Years later, in a 2007 interview with PlanetOut, Carlisle said that the band had female groupies and said, “Well, without going into too much detail … I think all of us in the band, we’ve all had … we’ve all seen the experience you are probably wondering about. And, yeah, like I said, without going into too much detail, we’ve all been there and done that.”      **Solo career**      The Go-Go’s broke up in 1985, and Carlisle embarked on a solo career (although she continued to work with fellow Go-Go [Charlotte Caffey](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Caffey)). Carlisle’s first album, [Belinda](http://www.last.fm/music/Belinda+Carlisle/Belinda), was released on [I.R.S. Records](http://www.last.fm/label/I.R.S.+Records) in 1986.
