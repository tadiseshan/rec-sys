Formed in Adelaide, South Australia in 2004.      The Audreys play [alternative](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative) [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) music. They have released three records, one in 2006 called [Between Last Night and Us](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Audreys/Between+Last+Night+and+Us), another in 2008 called [When The Flood Comes](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Audreys/When+The+Flood+Comes), and in 2010 [Sometimes The Stars](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Audreys/Sometimes+The+Stars). Their first two records won the ARIA Award for Best Blues and Roots Album.      After their debut album, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Taasha Coates says it took her and fellow songwriter/guitarist Tristan Goodall an age to get back to writing: “We were just a little Adelaide band that made an album, then suddenly we were touring constantly and playing on bigger and bigger stages… It was all so overwhelming and took up so much of our time that is was 18 months before we wrote another song”.      The Audreys are currently comprised of Taasha Coates (voice, piano, melodica, ukulele) and Tristan Goodall (acoustic and electric guitars, banjo). Former members include [Michael Green](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Green) (violin, lap steel, backing vocals), [LYNDON GRAY](http://www.last.fm/music/LYNDON+GRAY) (upright and electric bass) and [Toby Lang](http://www.last.fm/music/Toby+Lang) (drums).      <http://www.theaudreys.com.au>
