The late Dan Fogelberg (August 13, 1951, Peoria, Illinois – December 16, 2007, Deer Isle, Maine) was an American singer/songwriter who had several gold and platinum releases in the late 1970’s and early 80’s. During his solo career, under assistance of [Eagles](http://www.last.fm/music/Eagles) manager Irving Azoff, he rose to prominence and epitomized the [soft rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/soft%20rock) 70s sound. He also voiced his concerns on social and ecological issues, including the No Nukes concerts, and worked in the studio with a diverse variety of musicians including [Van Morrison](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Morrison), [Joe Walsh](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Walsh), [Tim Weisberg](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Weisberg) and [Ricky Skaggs](http://www.last.fm/music/Ricky+Skaggs).      The youngest of three sons, Dan was born in Peoria, Illinois, the son of Margaret (née Irvine), a classically-trained pianist, and Lawrence Peter Fogelberg, a high school band director, who spent most of his career at Peoria Woodruff High School and Pekin High School. Dan Fogelberg’s mother was a Scottish immigrant and his father was of Swedish descent. His father would later be the inspiration for the song [Leader Of The Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Fogelberg/_/Leader+Of+The+Band). Using a Mel Bay course book, Dan taught himself to play a Hawaiian slide guitar his grandfather gave to him; he also learned to play the piano. He started his music career at age 14 when he joined his first band, The Clan, which paid homage to [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles). His second band was another cover combo, [The Coachmen](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Coachmen), which in 1967 released two singles on Ledger Records: “[Maybe Time Will Let Me Forget](http://www.last.fm /music/The+Coachmen/_/Maybe+Time+Will+Let+Me+Forget)” and “[Don’t Want To Lose Her](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Coachmen/_/Don%27t+Want+To+Lose+Her).” Another was the blues band, Frankie and the Aliens, who toured regionally during the 1980s covering songs by [Cream](http://www.last.fm/music/Cream) and [Muddy Waters](http://www.last.fm/music/Muddy+Waters), among others.      After graduating from Woodruff High School in 1969, he studied theater arts and painting at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and began performing as a solo acoustic player in area coffeehouses including the Red Herring Coffeehouse where he made his first solo recordings as part of a folk festival recording in 1971. There, he was discovered in 1971 by Irving Azoff. Fogelberg and Azoff – who started his music-management career promoting another Champaign-Urbana act, [REO Speedwagon](http://www.last.fm/music/REO+Speedwagon) – moved to California to seek their fortunes. Fogelberg became a session musician who played with pop- folk artists like [Van Morrison](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Morrison). In 1972, he released his debut album _Home Free_ to lukewarm response
