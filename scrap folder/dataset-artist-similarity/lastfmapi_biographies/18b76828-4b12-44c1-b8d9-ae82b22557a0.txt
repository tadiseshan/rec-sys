He received a BA in English with a minor in Philosophy. After serving in the U.S. Army, he moved to New York City and launched his music career.      Allison’s first exposure to blues on record was through [Louis Jordan](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Jordan) recordings, including “Outskirts of Town” and “Pinetop Blues.” Allison credits Jordan as being a major influence on him, and also credits [Nat King Cole](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole), [Louis Armstrong](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Armstrong) and [Fats Waller](http://www.last.fm/music/Fats+Waller).

Allison also credits the songwriter [Percy Mayfield](http://www.last.fm/music/Percy+Mayfield) , “The Poet Laureate of the Blues,” as being a major inspiration on his songwriting.      After a stint in college and the Army, Allison’s first professional gig was in Lake Charles, LA, in 1950.
