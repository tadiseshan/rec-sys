Jimmy Ruffin (born 7 May 1939 in Collinsville, Mississippi; died 17 November 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada) was an American soul singer. His 1966 hit “What Becomes of the Brokenhearted” was a major success and his most well-known song. He was offered a chance to sing with [The Temptations](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Temptations), but he politely declined in favor of his younger brother, [David Ruffin](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Ruffin) (born 1941; died 1991).      After the success of “What Becomes of the Brokenhearted”, the intended follow- up, “East Side West Side”, was released only in Australia due to an argument with Motown head Berry Gordy. The song was written by Ron Welser and [Flamingos](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Flamingos)’ member Terry Johnson.      With his brother [David Ruffin](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Ruffin), Jimmy Ruffin released a popular cover version of “Stand By Me” (by [Ben E. King](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King)), taken from [The Ruffin Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ruffin+Brothers)’ album, I Am My Brother’s Keeper.      Jimmy Ruffin’s other hits include “I’ve Passed This Way Before”, “Gonna Give Her All The Love I’ve Got”, “Don’t You Miss Me A Little Bit Baby”, “I’ll Say Forever My Love”, “It’s Wonderful To Be Loved By You” and “Tell Me What You Want”.      In 1980 he collaborated with the [Bee Gees](http://www.last.fm/music/Bee+Gees)’ musician [Robin Gibb](http://www.last.fm/music/Robin+Gibb), who produced his album Sunrise. From it came the single which would be his last Top 10 UK and U.S. hit: “Hold On To My Love”. In 1986 Jimmy Ruffin collaborated with the British pop group [Heaven 17](http://www.last.fm/music/Heaven+17), singing “A Foolish Thing To Do” and “My Sensitivity” on a 12” EP record.      In the 1980s, Ruffin moved to live in Britain, where he continued to perform successfully. In December 1984 he collaborated with Paul Weller of The Style Council for his benefit single “Soul Deep.” This went under the name of The Council Collective.      Following the 2010 release of his album I Am My Brother’s Keeper, Ruffin began writing and recording songs for a new album that was never issued.      In 2012, a compilation album entitled, “There Will Never Be Another You”, including his hit songs “What Becomes of The Broken Hearted”, and “Hold On To My Love” had been released.      In addition to his brother [David Ruffin](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Ruffin) (deceased), Jimmy Ruffin had three other siblings: Quincy, Rita Mae (deceased) and Rosa (deceased).
