**Art Garfunkel** (born Arthur Ira Garfunkel on 5 November 1941 in Forest Hills, Queens, NYC, USA) is an American singer and actor, best known as half of the folk duo [Simon & Garfunkel](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+&+Garfunkel). He is of Romanian Jewish ancestry.      He met his future singing partner, [Paul Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon), in the sixth grade. Between 1956 and 1962, the two had performed together as Tom & Jerry. Garfunkel (“Tom Graph”) chose his nickname because he liked to track, or “graph” hits, on the pop charts. Garfunkel attended Columbia University in the early sixties, where he sang with the Kingsmen, an all-male a cappella group. While at Columbia, he was also a Brother of the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity. In 1962 Garfunkel earned a Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in art history, followed eventually by a Master’s degree in mathematics.      In 1963 he and Simon reformed the duo under their own names as Simon and Garfunkel and released their first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. on Columbia Records in October 1964. It was not a critical success, and the duo effectively split again after recording. The next year their producer Tom Wilson lifted the song “The Sound of Silence” from the record, redubbed an electric backing onto it, and released it as a single, which eventually went to #1 on the Billboard pop charts. They reunited and went on to become two of the most popular artists of the 1960s, releasing a total of five studio albums. However, citing personal differences and divergence in career interests, they split following the release of their most critically acclaimed album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, in 1970.      **Solo career**      In the 1970s, Garfunkel released a few solo albums, and although he did not reach the heights that Simon and Garfunkel had reached, he still scored hits with “I Only Have Eyes For You” (a 1934 song originally written by Harry Warren [1]) and “Bright Eyes” (both British #1 hit singles), and “All I Know” (#9 in the United States). A version of “Bright Eyes” also appeared in the movie Watership Down. He briefly reunited with Paul Simon in the 1975 hit “My Little Town”.

Following disappointing sales of his 1981 album Scissors Cut, Garfunkel reunited with Paul Simon for the famous concert in Central Park. The subsequent world tour went well musically, but they had disagreements during the tour, with the disappointment for Art Garfunkel that Paul Simon excluded Art’s voice from the new album that was announced as a S&G album and came out as a new Paul Simon solo album Hearts and Bones
