Edwin Starr (January 21, 1942 – April 2, 2003) was an American soul music singer. Born Charles Edwin Hatcher in Nashville, Tennessee, Starr is most famous for his Norman Whitfield produced Motown singles of the 1970s, most notably the number one hit [War](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+Starr/_/War).      Edwin Starr was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1942. He and his cousins (soul singers Roger and Willie Hatcher) moved to Cleveland, Ohio where they were raised.      In 1957 Starr formed a doo-wop group [The Future Tones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Future+Tones) and began his singing career. Starr lived in Detroit, Michigan in the 1960s and recorded at first for the small record label Ric-Tic, and later for the famed [Motown](http://www.last.fm/label/Motown) after it absorbed Ric-Tic in 1968.      The song which began his career was “[Agent Double’O’Soul](http://www.last.fm/ music/Edwin+Starr/_/Agent+Double%27O%27Soul)” (1965), a take-off on the James Bond films which were popular at the time.      He recorded more soul music for the next three years before having an international chart-topper in “25 Miles” (1968). As of 2005 it is one of only two Starr songs on oldies radio.      The biggest hit of his career, which cemented his reputation as a great soul artist, was the anti-Vietnam War protest song “War” (1970). A rousing tour-de- force, the vocals to “War” were - according to Starr - recorded in one take: an accomplishment which might make modern artists quail with apprehension. In explanation, Starr remained characteristically modest, explaining that he’d been allocated little studio time, so had to give each song his best shot.      Starr’s intense vocals transformed a Temptations album track into a #1 chart success, which spent three weeks in that top position on the US Billboard charts, an anthem for the antiwar movement and a cultural milestone that continues to resound a generation later in movie soundtracks and hip hop music samples.      “War” appeared on both Starr’s [War And Peace](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+Starr/War+And+Peace) LP and its follow- up, [Involved](http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+Starr/Involved). Involved also featured another song of very similar construction titled “Stop the War Now”, which was a minor hit in its own right.      Moving to England in 1973, Starr continued to record music into the 1970s, most notably recording the song “Hell Up In Harlem” for the 1974 film, Hell Up In Harlem, which was the sequel to Black Caesar, an earlier hit with a soundtrack by James Brown.      In 1979 Starr reappeared on the charts with a pair of disco hits, titled “(Eye-To-Eye) Contact” and “H.A.P.P.Y. Radio”. By now he had joined the well- established disco boom, and had further singles out on the record label 20th Century Records. Over the years he released tracks on many labels including Avatar, Calibre, 10 Records, Motown (a return to his former label for a 1989 remix of “25 Miles”), Streetwave and Hippodrome
