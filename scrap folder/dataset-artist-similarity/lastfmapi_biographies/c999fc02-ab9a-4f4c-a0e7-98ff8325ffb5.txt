After 23 years in the business Gary Barlow (with Take That) has sold over 50 million records including: eight No.1 albums, fifteen No.1 singles, seven million concert tickets as well as being the proud recipient of six Ivor Novello Awards. Together with Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen and Robbie Williams he is a member and main vocalist of one of the biggest British bands of all time.      Always driven by a determination that is equalled only by his talent, 2014 is set to be a phenomenal year for Mr Barlow. He is set to release his first solo studio album in over 14 years entitled ‘Since I Saw You Last’ through Polydor Records. Both the album and its lead single ‘Let Me Go’ are to be released in November. The video for ‘Let Me Go’ was filmed on the streets of New York City and was directed by Ben Winston who worked with Gary on the Diamond Jubilee documentary ‘Gary Barlow: On Her Majesty’s Service’. The anticipated album will also feature a duet with Elton John written by Gary entitled ‘Face To Face’. Gary wrote all the songs for ‘Since I Saw You Last’ in London and recorded them mainly between his own Future Studios and producer Steve Power’s TOP Studios, with the strings arrangements captured at Abbey Road Studios.      Gary’s last solo album ‘Twelve Months, Eleven Days’ was released in 1999, with his debut solo record ‘Open Road’ hitting the No.1 spot in May 1997.      Gary will be embarking on a full solo tour in April 2014. He last toured as a solo artist in 2012 with acclaim from fans and critics alike, demand was so great he could have sold certain venues out more than six times over. The ‘Since I Saw You Last’ tour will see Gary perform at some of the biggest venues he has ever played independently, including London’s O2 Arena, Birmingham’s LG Arena, Glasgow’s SSE Hydro and Manchester’s Phones 4U Arena.      Gary is one of Britain’s most accomplished songwriters and to no surprise was recently named in the Queen’s birthday honours list and was awarded an OBE for his huge contribution to British music as well as his significant charitable endeavors.         He also received the highly prestigious Music Industry Trust Award which was presented to him by Sir Elton John. Gary helped to organise two BBC Children in Need concerts: 2009, 2011 (the latter of which helped bring in the most donations ever for the charity) and will be organising another series of concerts for them in November 2013. He also recently coordinated the hugely successful Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace, gathering together some of the biggest names from the last 60 years to perform including: Paul McCartney, Elton John, Robbie Williams, Stevie Wonder, Tom Jones, Kylie Minogue and Grace Jones.      Gary’s headline tour is preceded by BBC Children In Need Rocks 2013 where he will be bringing some of the biggest names from the music industry together in two concerts this November
