**Peps Persson** (Per-Åke Tommy Persson), born December 20, 1946 in Tjörnarp, Scania, south [Sweden](http://www.last.fm/place/Sweden)), is a singer, guitarist, harmonicist and text writer. His main genres are rhytm & blues and reggae, and he introduced reggae in Sweden during the early 1970s.       Peps’s sound is very personal, thanks to his Scanian dialect and special voice. Peps has impressed black blues musicians from Chicago, something which should be seen as most unusual.      In 1973 he renamed his band Peps Bloodsband (previously known as Peps Bluesband), when the style got more and more reggae inspired. In the 1970s he made Swedish versions of classic Jamaican reggae tunes like “Small Axe,”, “Stir it up,” and “Talking Blues” ([Bob Marley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley)) ; “Mark of the Beast” ([Peter Tosh](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Tosh)); “Tenement Yard” ([Jacob Miller](http://www.last.fm/music/Jacob+Miller)); “Country Boy” ([The Heptones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Heptones)).                                       je Heptones.
