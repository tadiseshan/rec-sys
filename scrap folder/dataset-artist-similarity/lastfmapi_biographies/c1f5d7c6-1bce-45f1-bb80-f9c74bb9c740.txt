Rapper Bun B (born Bernard Freeman) rose to fame in the duo [UGK](http://www.last.fm/music/UGK). Bun B and [Pimp C](http://www.last.fm/music/Pimp+C) formed UGK in the late ’80s when their former crew, Four Black Ministers, fell apart. Based in Port Arthur, Texas, UGK signed with Jive and with 1992’s ‘[Too Hard To Swallow](http://www.last.fm/music/UGK/Too+Hard+To+Swallow)’ began a series of Southern [gangsta rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/gangsta%20rap) albums that were successful sellers. Bun B formed the side project [Mddl Fngz](http://www.last.fm/music/Mddl+Fngz) in 2000, but his main concern was still UGK. Things came to halt in 2003 when Pimp C was sentenced to eight years in prison on an aggravated gun assault charge. Bun B carried on solo, making numerous appearances on other artists’ tracks and then in 2005 releasing both the mixtape Legends and his debut album, [Trill](http://www.last.fm/music/Bun+B/Trill), a Top Ten hit. With Pimp C seeing early release in late 2005, Bun B returned to UGK and a self-titled double album from the duo dropped in 2007. Tragedy struck in late 2007 when Pimp C died suddenly, leaving Bun B to return to a solo career. His second solo album, [II Trill](http://www.last.fm/music/Bun+B/II+Trill), arrived in May of the next year. [Trill O.G.](http://www.last.fm/music/Bun+B/Trill+O.G.), his third solo album, was released in August of 2010.
