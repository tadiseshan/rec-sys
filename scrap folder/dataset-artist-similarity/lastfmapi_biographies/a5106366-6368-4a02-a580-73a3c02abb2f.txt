Bobbie Gentry (born July 27, 1944) is an American singer-songwriter. She was born Roberta Lee Streeter to Portuguese parents in Chickasaw County, Mississippi. She shot to international fame in the summer of 1967 with the quirky and intriguing [Ode to Billie Joe](http://www.last.fm/music/Bobbie+Gentry/_/Ode+to+Billie+Joe), written by Gentry and sung in her warm, captivating style. “Ode” was listed as the most popular single of the year in many U.S. record surveys and was admired by Frank Sinatra and other singers.      **Early years**      Gentry spent her childhood living with her father in Greenwood, Mississippi, where she attended elementary school and began teaching herself to play the guitar, the bass guitar, and the banjo. In her early teens, she moved to Palm Springs, California, to live with her mother, Ruby Bullington Streeter, graduating from Palm Springs High School in 1962. It was during this time that the teenage Roberta settled on the stage name “Bobbie Gentry,” and began performing at local country clubs, encouraged by no less a Palm Springs celebrity than Bob Hope.      After a short career as a Las Vegas showgirl, Gentry moved to Los Angeles, attended UCLA (where she was a philosophy major) and worked clerical jobs while occasionally performing in local nightclubs. She later transferred to the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music to hone her composition and performing skills.      **Rise to fame**      In 1967, Gentry recorded a demo and submitted it to Capitol Records executive Kelly Gordon, who quickly signed her to a recording contract and produced her first album. A 45 rpm “single” of two of her songs—”Mississippi Delta” and “Ode to Billie Joe”—was the first issue from this first effort, and even though “Mississippi Delta” was chosen for the “A” side, radio stations were quickly enamored with the quirky tale of Billie Joe McAllister and the mystery of his fate, as hauntingly performed and recorded on the “B” side. Bobbie Gentry had a monster hit on her hands, and Capitol Records had its newest superstar. Gentry went on to win three Grammy Awards that year, including “Best Vocal Performance by a Female”, and “Best New Artist.”      Gentry’s follow-up albums, The Delta Sweete and Local Gentry, both produced by Gordon, were issued in 1968. Though critically acclaimed, neither album garnered the kinds of sales figures that were realized with Gentry’s debut effort. The year 1968 also saw the release of an album of duets that paired Gentry with fellow Capitol alumnus Glen Campbell. Gentry and Campbell’s harmonies resulted in a gold record and three hit singles, including a cover of the Everly Brothers hit “All I Have to Do Is Dream”, which rose to No. 6 on the country charts in the winter of 1969.      Gentry toured briefly with Campbell and performed on a number of U.S. television programs and specials in the late 1960s
