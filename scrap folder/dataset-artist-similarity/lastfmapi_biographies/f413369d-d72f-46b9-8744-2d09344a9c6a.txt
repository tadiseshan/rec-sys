[Jeremy Soule](http://www.jeremysoule.com/) (b. December 19, 1975) is an award-winning American composer from Keokuk, Iowa and a prolific composer of orchestral videogame scores. Soule’s soundtracks are often critically acclaimed as being among the best in the computer and video games industry and as rivaling the quality of many orchestral film soundtracks. A large percentage of Soule’s music is done electronically and emulates real orchestral music so well that it is frequently indistinguishable from the real thing. He often collaborates with his brother, [Julian Soule](http://www.last.fm/music/Julian+Soule), with whom he also founded DirectSong; a company that sells DRM-free downloads of several classical composers, including Jeremy’s own compositions.      Soule has been working in the music industry since 1994 when he became an employee of Square. He then left to join Humongous Entertainment, where he composed for several children’s games as well as Total Annihilation, his first award-winning score. He left to form his own music production company, Soule Media in 2000, now called Artistry Entertainment. Through this company Soule has created several award-winning soundtracks. In 2005 he founded DirectSong. Soule’s works have been played in several live concerts such as the Symphonic Game Music Concert in Germany and the international Play! A Video Game Symphony concert series.      He has produced and composed music for:      * Armies of Exigo   * Azurik: Rise of Perathia   * Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance   * Company of Heroes   * Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts   * Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor   * Dungeon Siege   * Dungeon Siege II   * The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind   * The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion   * The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim   * Final Four   * Giants: Citizen Kabuto   * Guild Wars   * Guild Wars: Factions   * Guild Wars: Nightfall   * Guild Wars: Eye of the North   * Guild Wars 2   * Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s/Sorcerer’s Stone   * Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets   * Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban   * Icewind Dale   * Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter   * Impossible Creatures   * IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey   * Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events   * Mass Effect 3   * Neverwinter Nights   * Prey   * Secret of Evermore   * SOCOM   * Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic   * Star Wars: Bounty Hunter   * Supreme Commander   * Total Annihilation: Kingdoms   * Total Annihilation: The Core Contingency   * Total Annihilation    * Unreal II   * Warhammer: Mark of Chaos   * Warhammer40K: Dawn of War      Jeremy Soule recently took legal action against KHInsider, a website dedicated to keeping rare soundtracks online. The owner of the site decided to remove the offending material in order to avoid being sued by Soule, who was not only trying to have his own music removed, but all the music on the site.
