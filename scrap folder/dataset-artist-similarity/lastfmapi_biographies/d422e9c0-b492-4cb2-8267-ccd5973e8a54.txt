**Silje Nergaard** (born June 19, 1966 in Steinkjer, Norway) is a Norwegian pop and jazz vocalist based in Oslo. While her music early in her career (e.g. _Si det, si det_ from 1985) may have had a distinct pop feel, she has since moved on, and virtually all of her later releases consist of jazz-oriented tunes.       Nergaard’s musical journey began early. At age 16, she stepped on stage joining a jam session at _[Moldejazz](http://www.moldejazz.no/)_, Norway’s international jazz festival, with a band comprised of musicians from the band of the late jazz bass virtuoso [Jaco Pastorius](http://www.last.fm/music/Jaco+Pastorius). The country’s jazz journalists applauded the young talent. Since that day, she has steadily developed as a composer and become popular for her unique voice and talent for songwriting.      Since her 1990 inaugural jazz album, _Tell Me Where You’re Going_, produced by jazz guitar maestro [Pat Metheny](http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Metheny), Nergaard has become one among very few Norwegian artists to have had commercial releases in major music markets around the globe - including Brazil, Germany, the U.S., and the United Kingdom - and doing so with great success.      Her later albums, _[Port Of Call](http://www.last.fm/music/Silje+Nergaard/Port+Of+Call)_ (2000), _[At First Light](http://www.last.fm/music/Silje+Nergaard/At+First+Light)_ (2001), and _[Nightwatch](http://www.last.fm/music/Silje+Nergaard/Nightwatch)_ (2003), have all proved resounding commercial successes and received rapturous critical praise. With _Nightwatch_ she also made history: no other jazz artist before her had shot straight into the Norwegian sales charts twice to reach #1 within the first week of release. In 2004 she received a Norwegian music award for Musician of the Year.      With the 2007 release of her critically-acclaimed _[Darkness Out of Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Silje+Nergaard/Darkness+Out+of+Blue)_, Nergaard finally realized her dream of working with Grammy Award winner and renowned arranger [Vince Mendoza](http://www.last.fm/music/Vince+Mendoza), ([Elvis Costello](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello), [Joni Mitchell](http://www.last.fm/music/Joni+Mitchell), [Herbie Hancock](http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock)), who contributed string arrangements to two songs in the album, [Paper Boats](http://www.last.fm/music/Silje+Nergaard/_/Paper+Boats) and [Let me be troubled](http://www.last.fm/music/Silje+Nergaard/_/Let+me+be+troubled), with his beautiful sound and touch.      A year or two earlier, Nergaard had already decided to make a change in her music, which meant having to change some of her musicians, who had been touring with her for the past several years. As much as the style and ‘voice’ they had developed together were important to her, she came to realize that “you come to a point where you know you need to have a new challenge
