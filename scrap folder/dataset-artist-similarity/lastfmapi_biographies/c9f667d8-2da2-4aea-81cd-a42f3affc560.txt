Heltah Skeltah is a Hip Hop duo consisting of members Rock aka Da Rockness Monstah and Ruck aka [Sean Price](http://www.last.fm/music/Sean+Price). The two are members of Brooklyn hip hop supergroup [Boot Camp Clik](http://www.last.fm/music/Boot+Camp+Clik), along with [Black Moon](http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Moon), [Smif-n-Wessun](http://www.last.fm/music/Smif-n-Wessun), and [O.G.C.](http://www.last.fm/music/O.G.C.). Heltah Skeltah was formed in 1995.      Heltah Skeltah first appeared on Smif-N-Wessun’s album Dah Shinin’ in 1995, appearing on the tracks “[Wontime (LP Version)](http://www.last.fm/music/Smif-n-Wessun/_/Wontime+\(LP+Version\))”, “[Cession At Da Doghillee (LP Version)](http://www.last.fm/music/Smif-n-Wessun /_/Cession+At+Da+Doghillee+\(LP+Version\))” and “[Let’s Git it on](http://www.last.fm/music/Smif-n-Wessun/_/Let%27s+Git+it+on)”. Later in 1995, they grouped up with fellow Boot Camp members O.G.C. to form The Fab 5 (another nod to [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles)), and released a surprise hit single, “Leflaur Leflah Eshkoshka”. Out of The Fab 5 members, Rock and Ruck received the most amount of attention, due to their notable charisma and chemistry. The duo released their anticipated debut [Nocturnal](http://www.last.fm/music/Heltah+Skeltah/Nocturnal) in June 1996, which included “Leflah”, as well as the singles “[Operation lock down](http://www.last.fm/music/Heltah+Skeltah/_/Operation+lock+down)” and “[Therapy](http://www.last.fm/music/Heltah+Skeltah/_/Therapy)”. The album sold over 250,000 copies in the [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States), and has become a classic in the underground hip hop scene because of its grimy, basement sound and strong lyrics.      The duo released a group album with the Boot Camp Clik in 1997, then followed in 1998 with their second effort [Magnum Force](http://www.last.fm/music/Heltah+Skeltah/Magnum+Force). The album’s lead single, “[I Ain’t Havin’ That](http://www.last.fm/music/Heltah+Skeltah/_/I+Ain%27t+Havin%27+That)” (sampled from the [A Tribe Called Quest](http://www.last.fm/music/A+Tribe+Called+Quest) track “[Hot Sex](http://www.last.fm/music/A+Tribe+Called+Quest/_/Hot+Sex)”), became a Hot 100 hit. Despite the single’s success, most critics slammed the album due to its lighter content. Ruck and Rock seemed disillusioned with their lack of sales, and split in 2000. Rock began having problems with Duck Down Records, and split with the label, signing to [DJ Lethal](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Lethal)’s Lethal Records. He planned to release an album titled Planet Rock, but the label folded and the album disappeared. Sean Price stuck with the Boot Camp for their second group effort [The Chosen Few](http://www.last.fm/music/Boot+Camp+Clik/The+Chosen+Few) in 2002.      Heltah Skeltah reunited in 2005, making appearances on Sean Price’s solo album [Monkey Barz](http://www.last.fm/music/Sean+Price/Monkey+Barz) and Smif-N-Wessun’s [Reloaded](http://www.last
