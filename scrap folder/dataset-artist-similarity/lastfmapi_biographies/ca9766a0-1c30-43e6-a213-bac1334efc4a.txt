Steve Lacy (July 23, 1934 – June 4, 2004), born Steven Norman Lackritz in New York, was an innovative [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) [soprano saxophonist](http://www.last.fm/tag/soprano%20saxophonist).      Lacy began his career working with [dixieland](http://www.last.fm/tag/dixieland) music with masters such as [Henry “Red” Allen](http://www.last.fm/music/Henry+%22Red%22+Allen), [George “Pops” Foster](http://www.last.fm/music/George+%22Pops%22+Foster) and [Zutty Singleton](http://www.last.fm/music/Zutty+Singleton) and then with Kansas City jazz players like [Buck Clayton](http://www.last.fm/music/Buck+Clayton), [Dicky Wells](http://www.last.fm/music/Dicky+Wells), and [Jimmy Rushing](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Rushing) before jumping into the heart of the [avant-garde](http://www.last.fm/tag/avant-garde) by performing on the debut album of [Cecil Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Cecil+Taylor), and making a notable appearance on an early [Gil Evans](http://www.last.fm/music/Gil+Evans) album. His most enduring relationship, however, has been with the music of [Thelonious Monk](http://www.last.fm/music/Thelonious+Monk): Lacy recorded the first all- Monk album ([Reflections](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Lacy/Reflections), [Prestige](http://www.last.fm/label/Prestige), 1958) and played in Monk’s band briefly in 1960 and on Monk’s Big Band/Quartet album ([Big Band And Quartet In Concert](http://www.last.fm/music/Thelonious+Monk/Big+Band+And+Quartet+In+Conc ert), [Columbia](http://www.last.fm/label/Columbia), 1963). Monk tunes became a permanent part of his repertoire, making an appearance in virtually every concert appearance and on albums.      Lacy was interested in all the arts: the visual arts and poetry in particular became important sources for him (he frequently made musical settings of his favourite writers: [Robert Creeley](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Creeley), [Tom Raworth](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Raworth), [Brion Gysin](http://www.last.fm/music/Brion+Gysin) and other Beat writers, haiku, [Herman Melville](http://www.last.fm/music/Herman+Melville)…). He also collaborated with a truly extraordinary range of musicians, from [traditional jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/traditional%20jazz) to the [avant- garde](http://www.last.fm/tag/avant-garde) to [contemporary classical](http://www.last.fm/tag/contemporary%20classical) music. Outside of his regular sextet, his most important regular collaborator was probably the pianist [Mal Waldron](http://www.last.fm/music/Mal+Waldron), with whom he recorded a classic series of duet albums (notably [Sempre Amore](http://www.last.fm/music/Mal+Waldron%2FSteve+Lacy/Sempre+Amore), a collection of [Duke Ellington](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Ellington) and [Billy Strayhorn](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Strayhorn) material, [Soul Note](http://www.last.fm/label/Soul+Note), 1987).He also played with pianist [Eric Watson](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Watson)
