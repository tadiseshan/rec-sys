Chick Corea Elektric Band, led by renowned pianist Chick Corea, is one of the most critically acclaimed jazz fusion bands of the past two decades. Following the demise of Return to Forever, Corea established the musical ensemble in 1986. The Elektric Band is greatly different in style in comparison with Return to Forever in that it signified a move away from rock-oriented fusion into a more Post-bop style. Following a long hiatus, the band reunited to produce “To the Stars” in 2004.      Text taken from <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Corea_Elektric_Band>
