James Lewis Carter Ford (born Forest, Mississippi, 1924 - died Greenville, Mississippi, 16 July 2013) was an American ‘Mississippi Delta Blues’ musician better known by his stage name, T-Model Ford. Unable to remember his exact date of birth, he began his musical career in his early seventies, recording for the Fat Possum Records label.      His musical style melded traditional Chicago blues and juke joint blues styles with the rawness of Delta blues and a rebellious attitude. Also known as “The Taildragger”, Ford, in reference to his age, was known to tell studio musicians, “T-Model Ford is going to remember you sorry fuckers how it’s done.”
