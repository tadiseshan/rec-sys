Kirill “Kirka” Babitzin (September 22, 1950 - January 31 2007) was one of Finland’s most famous musicians.      Kirill Babitzin was born in Helsinki in 1950 to a Russian emigrant family. His musical career originally began at the age of five when his grandmother gave him an accordion. He later won an accordion competition at the age of ten but left the accordion playing for rock’n’roll.   His first band was The Creatures in which he joined in 1964, under his artist name Kirka.      Babitzin got his breakthrough in 1967 when he joined the band called The Islanders (originally led by Ilkka “Danny” Lipsanen as the major vocalist) and began touring in Finland. Kirka also recorded some singles with Blues Section.      In 1978, Babitzin released a duet album with his sister Anna, and the next year their sister Muska joined in. Kirka’s brother was the popular musician Sammy Babitzin, who was killed in a car crash in 1973.      Kirka represented Finland at the Eurovision Song Contest 1984, finishing as a strong 9th with the song Hengaillaan. His biggest hit was tune Surun pyyhit silmistäni that won the finnish song contest Syksyn Sävel. English version, made by artist himself, was successful in Greece. Foreign artists have recorded it successfully too in other languages. Kirka made the big success of course in Finland with a few albums.      Babitzin was awarded with the Emma award for best male singer twice, first in 1981 and then in 2000. He died suddenly on January 31 2007 at his home of undisclosed acute illness.
