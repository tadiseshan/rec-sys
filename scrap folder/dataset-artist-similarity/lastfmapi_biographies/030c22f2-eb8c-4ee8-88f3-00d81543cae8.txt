Bronze Nazareth was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan where his love for hip-hop was fostered by a group of friends wanting to escape their humble existence through the power of music. At sixteen, Bronze formed a group with his high school friends that planted the seeds for his future in music. He and his group ‘The South House Click’ attempted to work on their music, but lacking resources, never got the chance to record their dreams. While no actual recordings materialized, it was in this inner city home that Bronze’s creative spark was cultivated.      Bronze Nazareth is a Hip-Hop producer and MC associated with the [Wu-Tang Clan](http://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan). He is regarded as the new generation torchbearer of the Wu-Tang sound. He has a solo career as an emcee and is also the head of his Detroit based group the [Wisemen](http://www.last.fm/music/Wisemen).      After becoming a Wu Element in 2002 and moving to Detroit, two of Bronze’s beats were chosen by The RZA for his album [Birth of a Prince](http://www.last.fm/music/RZA/Birth+of+a+Prince). The album’s title track, on which RZA retired the popular Bobby Digital alter ego, was produced by Bronze as was the sonically brilliant ‘A Day to God is a Thousand Years’. In 2005, Bronze introduced a younger generation to Wu-Tang via the Source’s Independent Album of the Year (2005) [Wu Tang Meets the Indie Culture](http:// www.last.fm/music/Bronze+Nazareth/Wu+Tang+Meets+the+Indie+Culture). Garnering critical acclaim for his work on the album Nazareth found himself with a Babygrande Records recording contract. 2006 saw Bronze release his first solo album [The Great Migration](http://www.last.fm/music/Bronze+Nazareth/The+Great+Migration) where he proved his lyrical deft was on par with his production. Again, Nazareth’s album received critical acclaim.      Detroit, Michigan to New York City is a 15 hour one-way bus trip. It took Bronze Nazareth four of such round trips on a Greyhound bus from Detroit to New York to finally meet [RZA](http://www.last.fm/music/RZA), the abbot of the [Wu-Tang Clan](http://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan); the man responsible for selling millions of records, selling out arenas, scoring wildly successful movies and, generally, changing the course of popular culture. On the fourth trip, Bronze was able to use his talent to get inside 36 Chambers, ended up doing three tracks for one of Rza’s groups that was recording and then Rza arrived.      As Bronze recalls: “When he walked in I noticed he was nodding his head to the beats. After vibing for awhile in the studio, Rza and crew were about to go to the club, and I was like, ‘yo RZA, let me get just five minutes, that’s all I need!’ He graciously gave me those five minutes. I showed him one song, and it was Wu-Tang from then on.”      Upon hearing the song ‘Blowgun,’ The RZA immediately asked Bronze Nazareth to join his production group, The Wu Elements
