Kevin Moore is an ambient/experimental artist. While best known as the founding keyboardist of the progressive metal band [Dream Theater](http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater), the music he has since released under his own name has included film scores and avant-garde sound collages. After leaving Dream Theater around 1994, he traveled around the US writing and demoing much of the material for his debut [Chroma Key](http://www.last.fm/music/Chroma+Key) album, [Dead Air For Radios](http://www.last.fm/music/Chroma+Key/Dead+Air+For+Radios).      After moving to Costa Rica, he conducted a biweekly program on Radio for Peace International, a small shortwave activist radio station. From this venture into radio, Kevin took the material for his download-only release [Memory Hole 1](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Moore/Memory+Hole+1). Ever the pilgrim, Kevin then moved to Istanbul, Turkey where he worked on the soundtrack to the movie Okul, the result of which is the album [Ghost Book: Soundtrack to the Film Okul](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Moore/Ghost+Book:+Soundtrack+to+the+ Film+Okul). While in Turkey and collaborating with local musicians, he released the third Chroma Key album, [Graveyard Mountain Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Chroma+Key/Graveyard+Mountain+Home). He also worked on the soundtrack to the movie Küçük Kıyamet.      By March 2007, Kevin Moore has officially teamed up with Turkish industrial rock band [Makine](http://www.last.fm/music/Makine) for pre- and master- production of their debut album, which is planned to be released in the end of 2007.      **Discography:**      **With [Dream Theater](http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater):**   1989 - [When Dream And Day Unite](http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater/When+Dream+And+Day+Unite)   1992 - [Images and Words](http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater/Images+and+Words)   1993 - [Live at the Marquee](http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater/Live+at+the+Marquee)   1993 - Images and Words: Live in Tokyo (DVD)   1994 - [Awake](http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater/Awake)      **As [Chroma Key](http://www.last.fm/music/Chroma+Key):**   1998 - [Dead Air For Radios](http://www.last.fm/music/Chroma+Key/Dead+Air+For+Radios)   1999 - [Colorblind](http://www.last.fm/music/Chroma+Key/Colorblind) (single)   2000 - [You Go Now](http://www.last.fm/music/Chroma+Key/You+Go+Now)   2004 - [Graveyard Mountain Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Chroma+Key/Graveyard+Mountain+Home)      **As a solo artist (released as Kevin Moore):**   1999 - [This Is A Recording](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Moore/This+Is+A+Recording)   2004 - [Memory Hole 1](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Moore/Memory+Hole+1)   2004 - [Ghost Book: Soundtrack to the Film Okul](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevi n+Moore/Ghost+Book:+Soundtrack+to+the+Film+Okul)      **With [OSI](http://www.last.fm/music/OSI):**   2003 - [Office of Strategic Influence](http://www.last.fm/music/OSI/Office+of+Strategic+Influence)   2006 - [Free](http://www.last
