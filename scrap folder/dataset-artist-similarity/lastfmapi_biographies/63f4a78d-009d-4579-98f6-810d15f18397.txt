**Fairground Attraction** were a Scottish [acoustic pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/acoustic%20pop) group from Glasgow, best-known for the hit single “[Perfect](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction/_/Perfect)”, and for helping to launch the career of its lead singer, [Eddi Reader](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddi+Reader).      After the usual career-beginning playing in local clubs and pubs, in 1987 **Fairground Attraction** were signed to RCA, and released their first single, “Perfect”, in April 1988. It was an immediate success, reaching number one on the UK singles chart. Their album [The First Of A Million Kisses](http://www.l ast.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction/The+First+Of+A+Million+Kisses) was a characteristic blend of folk, jazz, country, and cajun elements (all but one of its songs being written by [Mark Nevin](http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Nevin)). Released in May 1988, it followed the success of “Perfect” by entering the album chart at number three, and rising to number two; it was eventually certified platinum. Three other singles were released from the same album: “[Find My Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction/_/Find+My+Love)” (which reached number seven on the UK chart), “[A Smile In A Whisper](http://www.last .fm/music/Fairground+Attraction/_/A+Smile+In+A+Whisper)”, and “[Clare](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction/_/Clare)”.      At the 1989 Brit Awards “Perfect” won the award for best single, and _The First of a Million Kisses_ won best album.      Although they were popular in European countries, and toured the United States, their main success outside the UK was in Japan, where they toured in 1989 (a tour that produced their only live album, [Kawasaki Live In Japan 02.0 7.89](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction/Kawasaki+Live+In+Japan+02 .07.89)).      In September 1989, however, during the recording of a second album, rumours of arguments circulated, and in January 1990 the rumours were confirmed when the band split up. The album [Ay Fond Kiss](http://www.last.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction/Ay+Fond+Kiss) was released in 1990, and one of its songs, “[Walking After Midnight](http://www.l ast.fm/music/Fairground+Attraction/_/Walking+After+Midnight)”, became their last single.
