Steve Goodman (July 25, 1948 – September 20, 1984) was an American folk music singer-songwriter from Chicago, Illinois. The writer of “City of New Orleans”, made popular by [Arlo Guthrie](http://www.last.fm/music/Arlo+Guthrie), Goodman won two Grammy Awards.      The Chicago-born singer-songwriter, was discovered by [Kris Kristofferson](http://www.last.fm/music/Kris+Kristofferson). He collaborated with close friend [John Prine](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Prine) throughout his career. His superb guitar ability (honed at Chicago’s Old Town School of Folk Music) and creative songwriting ability led him to success in the 1970s folk scene. Often funny, sometimes heartbreaking, always unpredictable, Steve Goodman was the consummate performer whether in a small Chicago venue, Austin City Limits, or opening for Steve Martin (and often stealing the show!). Steve is probably best known for his song “City of New Orleans”, which was later covered by [Arlo Guthrie](http://www.last.fm/music/Arlo+Guthrie) among others. He has also been covered by Jimmy Buffett and many others. Steve was the ultimate suffering Chicago Cub fan, writing the songs “Go, Cubs, Go” and the unfortunately very true “A Dying Cub Fans Last Request”.      Steve’s life was cut short in 1984 by leukemia, but fortunately an extensive catalog remains, including the recently released, “Live at the Earl” as well as the DVD “Steve Goodman Live at Austin City Limits and More.”
