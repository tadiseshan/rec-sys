**Juha Vainio** (born May 5, 1938 in Kotka, Finland; died October 29, 1990) was a Finnish singer, songwriter and translator of song lyrics. His body of work comprises more than 100 tunes and translations or original lyrics for well over 1000 songs recorded by countless Finnish singers. He was also a recording artist since his debut single of 1963, continuing his performing career well into the 1980s.      The themes for many of Vainio’s best-loved songs can be traced back to his childhood experiences in the coastal town of Kotka, presenting a melancholic juxtaposition of youthful memories and the feeling of aging. This can be witnessed in tunes such as “Kotkan poikii ilman siipii” and “Albatrossi”. A lot of his ealier work from the ’60s and ’70s shows a more rakish, good- humoured side of his personality.      Vainio’s work continues to have major relevance in Finnish popular music, an example of which being a Vainio cover album by Vesa-Matti Loiri in late 2003.
