Craig Morgan (born July 17, 1965) is an American neotraditional country music singer. He is noted for writing homey lyrics that focus on traditional values and the simpler pleasures of life.      Morgan was born in Kingston Springs, Tennessee and grew up in rural Tennessee. He became an Emergency medical technician at age 18. A few years later, he joined the Army and was stationed in South Korea. He would later see combat as part of Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989. During his deployment in Korea, Morgan wrote a number of songs and won various military singing and songwriting contests. He is a vocal supporter of the US military, performing for service-personnel in the Middle East and elsewhere.      Upon his return home to Tennessee, he worked various jobs to support his family, including working as a construction worker, a security guard and a sheriff’s deputy. He would later land a job in Nashville singing demos for other songwriters and publishing companies.      The demos led to releasing his first album with Atlantic Records, the self- titled Craig Morgan in 2000. In 2003, Morgan signed with Broken Bow Records and released his second album, I Love It. It featured the single “Almost Home”, which broke into the Top 10 and earned Morgan a Songwriter Achievement Award from the Nashville Songwriters Association International.      In 2005, Morgan released his third album, My Kind of Livin’, which included the smash hit “That’s What I Love About Sunday.” A four-week number one hit in the early spring of 2005, it was the biggest country music song of that year according to Billboard. The album also included the #2 hit “Redneck Yacht Club”. Also included was “I Got You”, which Craig had originally penned for Keith Urban, but decided to cut himself instead. “Little Bit Of Life”, the lead-off single and title track of his fourth album, is currently climbing the charts.
