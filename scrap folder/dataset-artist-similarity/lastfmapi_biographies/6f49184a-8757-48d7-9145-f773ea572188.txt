**The Korgis** are a Pop-band formed circa 1978 from the United Kingdom, originally composed of James Warren (vocals, bass) and Andy Davis (drums, vocals), both ex-members of [Stackridge](http://www.last.fm/music/Stackridge), along with the unofficial members Stuart Gordon (guitar) and Phil Harrison (keyboards).      Their successful period lasted until 1982. In 1986 Warren would go on to issue a solo LP entitled Burning Questions in. Some of the singles during this era were released as ‘The Korgis’ and co-produced by Andy Davis.      The band reunited in 1990 to re-record “Everybody’s Got to Learn Sometime”. The re-formed group, consisting of James Warren, Andy Davis and John Baker, released the album This World’s For Everyone in 1992, having some success in Continental Europe and Japan, before breaking up again.      In 2005 Warren, Davis and Baker reunited again for a film shoot for DVD/compilation album Kollection and recorded the fourteen-track album Unplugged, which was released on the Angel Air record label the following year.      Their biggest hit was [Everybody’s Got to Learn Sometime](http://www.last.fm/m usic/The+Korgis/_/Everybody%27s+Got+to+Learn+Sometime), which later was covered from artists like [Beck](http://www.last.fm/music/Beck), [Zucchero](http://www.last.fm/music/Zucchero), [Erasure](http://www.last.fm/music/Erasure), [Army of Lovers](http://www.last.fm/music/Army+of+Lovers), [Baby D](http://www.last.fm/music/Baby+D) (who used the title [I Need Your Loving](http://www.last.fm/music/Baby+D/_/I+Need+Your+Loving)) and [Krezip](http://www.last.fm/music/Krezip). There’s also a translated version by [Daniël Lohues](http://www.last.fm/music/Dani%C3%ABl+Lohues) in a Dutch dialect (Drents).
