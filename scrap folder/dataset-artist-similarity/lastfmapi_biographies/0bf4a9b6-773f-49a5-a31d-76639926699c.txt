Dandy Livingstone (Robert Livingstone Thompson, Kingston, Jamaica, 14 December 1943) is a Jamaican reggae musician and producer      He is best known for his 1972 hit, “Suzanne Beware of the Devil”, and for his song, “Rudy, A Message to You”, which was later a hit for The Specials. “Suzanne Beware of the Devil”, reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart.      At the age of 15, Livingstone moved to the United Kingdom. Livingstone’s first record was released without his knowledge - a tenant in the building where he and a friend jammed recorded some of these sessions and released some tracks on the Planetone record label. When London-based Carnival Records were seeking a Jamaican vocal duo, Livingstone filled the requirement by double-tracking his own voice, releasing records in this fashion under the name ‘Sugar & Dandy’. One of these singles, “What a Life”, sold 25,000 copies, providing Livingstone with his first hit. When called on to perform live, Roy Smith was recruited to make up the duo, although he would be replaced by Tito “Sugar” Simon.      In 1967, Livingstone signed with Ska Beat Records, for whom he recorded his debut album 1968’s Rocksteady with Dandy.      In 1968 Livingstone moved into production, and formed a duo with Audrey Hall (as ‘Dandy & Audrey’). His production of other artists included The Marvels’ debut album, and hit singles by Nicky Thomas (“Suzanne Beware of The Devil”) and Tony Tribe (“Red Red Wine”).      In the late 1960s, Livingstone worked with the trombonist, Rico Rodriguez, who had featured on “Rudy, A Message to You”. Rodriguez later played with The Specials, whose 1979 cover version of the song made it famous. Livingstone produced several singles for Rodriguez under the name ‘Rico & the Rudies’.      Livingstone signed to Trojan Records in 1968, releasing two albums, Follow That Donkey and Dandy Returns. A Trojan subsidiary, Down Town Records, was set up to release Livingstone’s output, both as a singer and producer, the J-Dan subsidiary serving the same purpose in the early 1970s. In the early 1970s, Livingstone returned to Jamaica, living there until 1973.      Livingstone resurfaced in 1973 with the “Black Star” single on Mooncrest Records, and the album Conscious. On his return to the UK, he recorded a self- titled album at Byron Lee’s studio.      The 2 Tone movement in Britain of the late 1970s brought Livingstone to a new audience.            Dandy is one of the great unsung heroes of the early British Reggae scene.      In 1963 he chanced to meet Lee Gopthal, who later founded Trojan Records, and soon began working in the record shop Gopthal owned. ‘Dandy’ - a natty dresser - heard that a local record company was keen to sign up a Jamaican duo. So as not to miss the chance, the enterprising would-be singer double-tracked his voice. He then offered the recording to the record company as the debut of a new male duo he called “Sugar and Dandy”
