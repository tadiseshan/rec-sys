Trillville is a rap group from the U.S. city of Atlanta. They first entered the rap scene in 1997 to try and become the “Gods of Crunk”. At this time they were still in ninth grade at school. Dirty Mouth was leader of the school’s snare drum line along with writing his own rhymes, Don P was rapping and working on producing beats with his keyboard, and Lil LA (aka Lil Atlanta) was an aspiring promoter, later to become a rapper himself. Lil LA always gave the group a sold out performance each time they were on stage and not long after, he became a group member.      Lil Jon visited one of their performances and not long after, signed them up to BME records. Their single, Neva Eva, started climbing up the charts in late 2003. They then started working on their first album, which was released in 2004. The album, “The King of Crunk and BME Recordings presents Lil’ Scrappy and Trillville,” included guest appearances by such ‘Dirty South’ rappers as Lil’ Jon, Pastor Troy, and Bo Hagon. The next single off the album, “Get Some Crunk In Your System,” received some play time, however never lived out to its full potential. However, the third single, ‘Some Cut,’ received much play on the radio nationwide. Trillville also recently appeared with Chingy on Tyra’s “Country Boy (Remix)”.      Trillville is located in Bowen which is a suburb of Clemson, South Carolina.
