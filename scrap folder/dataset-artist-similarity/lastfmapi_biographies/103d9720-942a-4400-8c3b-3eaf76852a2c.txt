[Raheem DeVaughn](http://www.raheemdevaughnmusic.com)’s debut album was “[The Love Experience](http://www.last.fm/music/Raheem+DeVaughn/The+Love+Experience);” his critically acclaimed follow-up was “[Love Behind The Melody](http://www.last.fm/music/Raheem+DeVaughn/Love+Behind+The+Melody).”      DeVaughn’s musical story began with his mother’s vinyl collection. “I always loved music so I would sneak into her record collection when she wasn’t around and play her stuff.” DeVaughn’s father, noted jazz musician [Abdul Wadud](http://www.last.fm/music/Abdul+Wadud) was also an influence. DeVaughn knew at an early age that he would become an entertainer.      DeVaughn graduated from High Point High School in Beltsville, Maryland; then headed to nearby Coppin State. It was the first day of college that changed the course of his life. “I saw a group of guys standing outside singing, Boyz II Men style,” remembers DeVaughn. “I just went up there and started harmonizing with them. Before I knew what was going on, I was in a group, cutting class to write lyrics and record.” After winning $2,000.00 in a talent show at Bar None, a Washington D.C. nightclub, DeVaughn decided to go for broke and invested all of his winnings into a CD burner. Several independent releases led to a showcase with [album]Jive Records[/album], and the career was on it’s way.
