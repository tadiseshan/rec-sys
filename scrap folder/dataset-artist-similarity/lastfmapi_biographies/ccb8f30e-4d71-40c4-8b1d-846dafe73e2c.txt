[George Michael](http://www.georgemichael.com) (born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou on June 25, 1963 in East Finchley, London, England) is an English [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) musician of English/Greek Cypriot ancestry. Michael began his career by forming a band called [The Executive](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Executive) together with his best friend [Andrew Ridgeley](http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Ridgeley), a fellow pupil at Bushey Meads School, though it did not survive for long.      It wasn’t until he formed the [duo](http://www.last.fm/tag/duo) [Wham!](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!), working together again with Ridgeley, in 1981 that he achieved success. Their first album, ‘_[Fantastic!](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/Fantastic!)_’, achieved almost instant acclaim, and, within a year, they had released their classic debut single, “[Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/_/Wham+Rap!+\(Enjoy+What+You+Do\))”. Their second single, “[Young Guns (Go For It)](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/_/Young+Guns+\(Go+For+It\))”, became the first in a string of Top 10 hits in the U.K. singles chart, showing that they had captured a spirited, [dance pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/dance%20pop) side of the popular [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) scene.      Those songs were rapidly followed by tracks such as “[Bad Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/_/Bad+Boys)”, “[Club Tropicana](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/_/Club+Tropicana)”, “[Wake Me up Before You Go-Go](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/_/Wake+Me+up+Before+You+Go- Go)”, “[Freedom](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/_/Freedom)”, “[Last Christmas](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/_/Last+Christmas)”, “[Everything She Wants](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/_/Everything+She+Wants)”, and “[I’m Your Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/_/I%27m+Your+Man)”. With the commercial and critical success seen by the band after their second album, ‘_[Make It Big](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/Make+It+Big)_’, they appeared to be on top of the world. George Michael also sang on the original [Band Aid](http://www.last.fm/music/Band+Aid) recording of “[Do They Know It’s Chris tmas](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Band+Aid/_/Do+They+Know+It%27s+Chri stmas)”, and he donated the profits from the “Last Christmas” / “Everything She Wants” dual-single release to the charity.      With the strong acclaim received by his solo releases “[Careless Whisper](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Michael/_/Careless+Whisper)” (1984) and “[A Different Corner](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Michael/_/A+Different+Corner)” (1986) stories of an impending [Wham!](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!) split intensified. Michael and Ridgeley just seemed pulled in two distinct musical directions. The group duly separated in the summer of 1986 after a farewell single was released, “[The Edge of Heaven](http://www.last.fm/music/Wham!/_/The+Edge+of+Heaven)”, and their last album came out
