Lemar Obika (born 4 April 1978), professionally known as Lemar, is a British Soul and R&B Singer, Songwriter and Vocal Producer who has had a run of chart success in the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia.      Biography:   Lemar was born in London to Nigerian (Igbo) parents, and was raised in Tottenham, London, listening to Soul Music and R&B. He used to sing at home with his brothers and sister, pretending to be The Jacksons. He was seventeen when he had his first concert at the Junior Jam at the Temple in Tottenham supporting Usher. He gave up an opportunity to study pharmacy at the Cardiff University to pursue a musical career. Lemar had some success supporting various artists such as Destiny’s Child, Total, Uncle Sam and Usher Raymond on their UK club tours and after some years, managed to secure a recording contract with BMG. Following this, he released his debut single “Got Me Saying Ooh” in 2001. Unfortunately his record deal with BMG fell through in less than a year due to restructuring at the record label. He had to eventually take a job working as an accounts manager at NatWest in Enfield, north London.      On Saturday 19th January 2008, MSN UK reported that Lemar became a father for the first time with his long term partner Charmaine Powell, who gave birth to a baby girl called Nyiema Obika at London’s private Portland hospital weighing 7 lb.      Recording Career:   Lemar’s second single “Dance (With U)” reached number two on the UK Singles Chart in early 2003. His first album Dedicated was released late in 2003 with additional singles “50/50” and “Another Day” also achieving chart success in the UK. Lemar won a BRIT Award for “Best Urban Act” in 2004.
