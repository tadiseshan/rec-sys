Alvin Lee (19 December 1944 - 6 March 2013) was famous as the guitarist in the seminal seventies rock band [Ten Years After](http://www.last.fm/music/Ten+Years+After).      Born Graham Barnes in Nottingham England, Alvin Lee took up guitar at the age of thirteen. By the age of fifteen he had formed the group Jaybirds. Following in the footsteps of earlier beat groups such as the Beatles, the Jaybirds played the clubs in Hamburg, Germany to great local acclaim. On returning to London in 1966, the group changed its name to _Ten Years After_.      Ten Years After scored hits with many albums and became a popular touring band. The band gained note in America after their appearance at Woodstock in 1969.   Lee’s guitar work on _‘I’m Going Home’_ on the ‘Woodstock’ album and film remains a standard for many rock guitarists to emulate.   Ten Years After played a mix of rock and blues tinged with jazz. In 1973, Lee left Ten Years After to pursue a solo career.      His first work was a collaborative effort with American gospel singer Mylon LeFevre on an album entitled _On The Road To Freedom_; other artists on the album included [George Harrison](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison), [Mick Fleetwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Fleetwood) and [Steve Winwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Winwood). A year later he formed the band Alvin Lee & Company and released a double live album recorded at the Rainbow in London, _In Flight_.   Lee continued to record albums and play live until his death in 2013, thrilling audiences with his guitar virtuoso and nimble fingered fret work.   Having recorded over twenty albums, some of the key solo works Alvin Lee has recorded are:   1973 On The Road To Feedom   1974 In Flight   1975 Pump Iron   1976 Let it Rock   1978 Rocket Fuel   1979 Ride On   1980 Freefall   1981 RX5   1986 Detroit Diesel   1992 Zoom   1994 I Hear You Rockin   1996 Live In Vienna   2004 In Tennessee   2007 Saguitar   2012 Still On The Road To freedom      Official Website: [Alvin Lee](http://alvinlee.com/)      You can also see [Alvin Lee & Ten Years After](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Alvin+Lee+&+Ten+Years+After) and / or [Alvin Lee & Co](http://www.last.fm/music/Alvin+Lee+&+Co) and / or [Ten Years After](http://www.last.fm/music/Ten+Years+After) and or [Alvin Lee & Ten Years Later](http://www.last.fm/music/Alvin+Lee+&+Ten+Years+Later) and / or [The Alvin Lee Band](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Alvin+Lee+Band) on Last.fm.
