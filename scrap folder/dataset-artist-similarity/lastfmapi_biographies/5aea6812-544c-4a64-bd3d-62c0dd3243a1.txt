**Jason Molina** (December 16, 1973 – March 16, 2013) was an American musician and singer-songwriter, originally from Lorain, Ohio. After playing bass guitar in various heavy metal bands in and around Cleveland, Molina made the decision to become a solo artist under an assumed band name, recruiting other musicians for each individual project as needed. He came to prominence performing and recording as [Songs: Ohia](http://www.last.fm/music/Songs:+Ohia), both in solo projects and with a rotating cast of musicians. Since 2003, he had recorded either under his own name or with a stable line-up of band members as the [Magnolia Electric Co.](http://www.last.fm/music/Magnolia+Electric+Co.).      He developed a method of tuning his guitar that complemented his voice and worked with his background as a bass player. Finding his niche in [indie rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rock) circles, Molina made home recordings under the names ‘Songs: Albian’, ‘Songs: Radix’, and ‘Songs: Unitas’ to pass out at live shows. Settling on ‘[Songs: Ohia](http://www.last.fm/music/Songs:+Ohia)’, Molina released a single on [Palace Records](http://www.palacerecords.com/) in 1996. The first ‘Songs: Ohia’ full-length followed in 1997; released on the [Secretly Canadian](http://www.secretlycanadian.com/home.php) label.      By 2001, Molina had given his tenor guitar a rest in favor of a regular six- string instrument and had put together a full band to back him. However, 2002’s _[Didn’t it Rain](http://www.last.fm/music/Songs%3A+Ohia/Didn%27t+It+Rain)_ saw Molina working with members of [neo-bluegrass](http://www.last.fm/tag/neo-bluegrass) outfit [Jim & Jennie & The Pinetops](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Jim+&+Jennie+&+The+Pinetops), achieving an almost [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel) sound that was a vast departure from the dense feel of _[Ghost Tropic](http://www.last.fm/music/Songs%3A+Ohia/Ghost+Tropic)_. Constantly recording and writing new songs, Songs: Ohia released a handful of singles and EPs in 2002, including a split EP with Louisville’s [My Morning Jacket](http://www.last.fm/music/My+Morning+Jacket) and a collaborative EP (under the name [Amalgamated Sons of Rest](http://www.last.fm/music/Amalgamated+Sons+of+Rest)) with [Will Oldham](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Oldham) and [Alasdair Roberts](http://www.last.fm/music/Alasdair+Roberts). _[Pyramid Electric Co.](http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Molina/Pyramid+Electric+Co)_ and _[Magnolia Electric Co.](http://www.last.fm/music/Songs%3A+Ohia/The+Magnolia+Electric+Co)_, originally conceived as a double album, were released separately in early 2003. The former, a sparse solo album, was recorded with [Mike Mogis](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Mogis) (from [Lullaby For The Working Class](http://www.last.fm/music/Lullaby+For+The+Working+Class)) while the latter featured a full band and was recorded by [Steve Albini](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Albini).      Jason Molina died, at age 39, on 18
