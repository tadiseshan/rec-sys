Mary Esther Wells (May 13, 1943 – July 26, 1992) was an American singer who defined the early sound of Motown Records in the early sixties. Along with [The Miracles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Miracles), [The Temptations](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Temptations), [The Supremes](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Supremes), and[The Four Tops](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Four+Tops), Wells was said to have been part of the charge in black music onto radio stations and record shelves of mainstream America “bridging the color lines in music at the time.”      With a string of hit singles mainly composed by [Smokey Robinson](http://www.last.fm/music/Smokey+Robinson) including “Two Lovers” (1962), the Grammy-nominated “You Beat Me to the Punch” (1962) and her signature hit, “My Guy” (1964), she became recognized as “The Queen of Motown” until her departure from the company in 1964, at the height of her popularity. In other circles, she’s referred to as the “The First Lady of Motown” and was one of Motown’s first singing superstars.      Mary Esther Wells was born near Detroit’s Wayne State University on May 13, 1943 to a domestic mother and an absentee father. One of three children, she caught spinal meningitis at the age of two and struggled with partial blindness, deafness in one ear and temporary paralysis. During her early years, Wells’ family grew up in a poor residential Detroit district. By age 12, Wells was helping her mother with housecleaning work. She described the ordeal years later:      “Daywork they called it, and it was damn cold on hallway linoleum. Misery is Detroit linoleum in January—with a half-froze bucket of Spic-and-Span.”      Wells used singing as her comfort from her pain and by age ten had graduated from church choirs to performing at local nightclubs in the Detroit area. Wells graduated from Detroit’s Northwestern High School at the age of 17 and set on sights of becoming a scientist but already hearing about the success of Detroit musicians such as Jackie Wilson and The Miracles decided to try her hand at music as a singer-songwriter.      In 1960, 17-year-old Wells approached Tamla Records founder Berry Gordy at Detroit’s Twenty Grand club with a song she had intended for Jackie Wilson to record, since Wells knew of Gordy’s collaboration with Wilson. However, a tired Gordy insisted Wells sing the song in front of him. Impressed, Gordy had Wells enter Detroit’s United Sound Studios to record the single, titled “Bye Bye Baby”. After a reported twenty-two takes, Gordy signed Wells to the Motown subsidiary of his expanding record label and released the song as a single in late 1960 where it eventually peaked at number eight on the R&B chart in 1961, later crossing over to the top fifty on the pop singles chart where it peaked at number 45.      Wells’ early Motown career insisted on a rougher R&B production that predated the smoother sound of her bigger hit recordings
