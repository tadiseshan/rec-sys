Duke Special (real name Peter Wilson; born on 4 January 1971 in Lisburn, Northern Ireland) is a Northern Ireland songwriter and performer based in Belfast. A piano-based songwriter with a romantic style and a warm, distinctly accented voice, he has distinctive long dreadlocks, eyeliner and outfits he describes as “hobo chic”.      Live performances have a theatrical style inspired by Vaudeville and music hall, and often incorporate 78s played on an old-fashioned gramophone, or sound effects from a transistor radio. He is most often accompanied by percussionist “Temperance Society” Chip Bailey, who plays cheese graters and egg whisks, a Stumpf fiddle and a Shruti box, as well as the more typical drums and cymbals. Other musicians who perform with Wilson from time to time include Paul Pilot (guitar), Réa Curran (trumpet, backing vocals, accordion), Ben Castle (clarinet, saxophone), Ben Hales (bass guitar), Gareth Williams, “Professor” Ger Eaton (keyboards), Dan Donnelly (mandoline, backing vocals) and Serge Archibald III (saxophone, “ethereal background sounds”, vibes).      From beginning solo performing in 2002, his albums include Adventures in Gramophone (2005), Songs from the Deep Forest (2006), both of which were nominated for the Choice Music Prize, I Never Thought This Day Would Come (2008), Little Revolutions (2009), The Silent World of Hector Mann (2010), Mother Courage and Her Children (2010), Under the Dark Cloth (2011) and Oh Pioneer (2012).      Music was all he ever wanted to do. He learned piano as a child and sang traditional Irish songs in churches and community centres with his sisters. Soon he began writing his own songs and played in some local rock bands with little success.      Under his pseudonym ‘Duke Special’ he recorded two limited EPs ([Lucky Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Special/Lucky+Me), [My Villain Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Special/My+Villain+Heart)) and sold them at hundreds of concerts across Ireland, the UK and Germany. He supported [Aqualung](http://www.last.fm/music/Aqualung), [Rufus Wainwright](http://www.last.fm/music/Rufus+Wainwright), [Paddy Casey](http://www.last.fm/music/Paddy+Casey), [Gemma Hayes](http://www.last.fm/music/Gemma+Hayes), cDavid Ford, [The Divine Comedy](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy) [Snow Patrol](http://www.last.fm/music/Snow+Patrol) and many others over the last years. More than 6,000 copies of the EPs were sold, and Duke re-released the two EPs as an album ([Adventures in Gramophone](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Special/Adventures+in+Gramophone)). In 2005 the “[Your Vandal](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Special/Your+Vandal)”-EP was released.      Special credit must be given to his onstage partner Chip Bailey, who greatly amuses with self-made percussions formerly known as kitchenware.
