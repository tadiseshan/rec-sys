**Porter Wayne Wagoner** (August 12, 1927 – October 28, 2007) was an American country music singer. Famous for his flashy Nudie suits and blond pompadour, Wagoner introduced a young Dolly Parton to his long-running television show. Together, “Porter and Dolly” were a well-known duet team for many years. Parton wrote the song “I Will Always Love You” after Wagoner suggested she shift from story songs to focus on love songs.      His first band, The Blue Ridge Boys, performed on radio station KWPM from a butcher shop in his native West Plains, Missouri where Wagoner cut meat. Wagoner’s big break came in 1951, when he was hired as a performer by station KWTO in Springfield, Missouri. This led to a contract with RCA Records. With lagging sales, Wagoner and his trio played schoolhouses for the gate proceeds.      In 1953, his song entitled “Trademark” became a hit for Carl Smith, followed by a few hits of his own on RCA. He was a featured performer on ABC’s Ozark Jubilee and moved to Nashville and joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1957.      Wagoner was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2002. His 81 charted records include “Satisfied Mind” (#1, 1955), “Misery Loves Company” (#1, 1962), “I’ve Enjoyed As Much of This As I Can Stand” (#7, 1962–1963), “Sorrow on the Rocks” (#5, 1964), “Green, Green Grass of Home” (#4, 1965), “Skid Row Joe” (#3, 1965–1966), “The Cold Hard Facts of Life” (#2, 1967), and “The Carroll County Accident” (#2, 1968–1969). Among his hit duets with Dolly Parton were a cover of Tom Paxton’s “The Last Thing on My Mind” (1967), “We’ll Get Ahead Someday” (1968), “Just Someone I Used To Know” (1969), “Better Move it on Home” (1971), “Please Don’t Stop Loving Me” (#1, 1974) and “Making Plans” (#2, 1980). He also won three Grammy Awards for gospel recordings.      The Porter Wagoner Show ran on syndicated television from 1960 to 1981. There were 686 thirty minute episodes filmed, the first 104 being shot in black and white, the remainder in color. At its peak, it was featured in over 100 markets, with an average viewership of over three million. Reruns of the program currently air on the rural cable network RFD-TV.      Wagoner brought James Brown to the Grand Ole Opry, produced a rhythm & blues album for Joe Simon, and appeared in the Clint Eastwood film Honkytonk Man. [1] During the mid 1980s, Wagoner formed an all girl group called The Right Combination which was named after one of Porter and Dolly Parton’s hit records. He also hosted “Opry Backstage” during the 1990s on The Nashville Network where he interviewed guests. Though Parton’s departure caused some animosity on both sides, the two reconciled in the late 1980s and have appeared together a number of times in the years since; Parton inducted Wagoner into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2002.      Wagoner made a guest appearance on the HBO comedy series Da Ali G Show, being interviewed by the fictional character Borat, in its second season
