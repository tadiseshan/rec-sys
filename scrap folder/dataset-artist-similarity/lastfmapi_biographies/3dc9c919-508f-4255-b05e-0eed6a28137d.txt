Tracy Darrell (Trace) Adkins is an American [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) music artist, born January 13, 1962, in Springhill, Louisiana.      His musical interest came at an early age, when his father taught him to play the guitar. In high school, he joined a [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel) music group called the New Commitments. He was also a member of Future Farmers of America (FFA). Later, Adkins went on to study petroleum technology at Louisiana Tech University, where he also played football. After graduation, he took up work at an oil rig. He lost the pinky finger on his left hand in an accident, and asked doctors to reattach the finger at an angle so that he could continue to play guitar. After working on the oil rigs for a few years, Adkins embarked on what he calls his “true musical education” — playing one [honky- tonk](http://www.last.fm/tag/honky-tonk) after another. While singing at Tillie’s & Lucy’s Pub in Nashville, Adkins was spotted by a [Capitol Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Capitol+Records) executive and was signed to the label.      Adkins’s first single, [There’s A Girl In Texas](http://www.last.fm/music/Trace+Adkins/_/There%27s+A+Girl+In+Texas), was released in 1996, reaching the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. It was followed by the release of his debut album, [Dreamin’ Out Loud](http://www.last.fm/music/Trace+Adkins/Dreamin%27+Out+Loud), later that year. The album produced several hit singles, including his first Top 5 single, [Every Light In The House](http://www.last.fm/music/Trace+Adkins/_/Every+Light+In+The+House), his first Number One in [(This Ain’t) No Thinkin’ Thing](http://www.last.fm/music/ Trace+Adkins/_/\(This+Ain%27t\)+No+Thinkin%27+Thing), and another Top 5 hit in [I Left Something Turned On At Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Trace+Adkins/_/I +Left+Something+Turned+On+At+Home). The latter single was also a Number One hit in [Canada](http://www.last.fm/place/Canada). His second album, [Big Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Trace+Adkins/Big+Time), produced a Top 5 in [The Rest Of Mine](http://www.last.fm/music/Trace+Adkins/_/The+Rest+Of+Mine), but subsequent singles proved less successful. A change in management delayed the release of Adkins’s third album, but the album ([More…](http://www.last.fm/music/Trace+Adkins/More...)) was eventually released in late 1999. Although the album’s title track reached Top 10, [More…](http://www.last.fm/music/Trace+Adkins/More...) failed to achieve gold status.      On July 5, 2001, Adkins was charged with driving under the influence in Nolensville, Tennessee. The singer pled guilty and was sentenced to 11 months in jail; however, the sentence was suspended after 48 hours. In addition, he had to pay $350 in fines, and his driver’s license was suspended for one year. Shortly afterward, he was injured in a tractor accident and had to temporarily cancel touring
