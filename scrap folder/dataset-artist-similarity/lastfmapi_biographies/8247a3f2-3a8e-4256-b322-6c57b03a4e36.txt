There are at least three artists with this name: a jazz pianist, a jazz saxophonist and a banjo player.      **1.)** Bill Evans (born William John Evans; 16th August 1929-15th September 1980) was one of the most famous jazz pianists of the twentieth century. Along with [McCoy Tyner](http://www.last.fm/music/McCoy+Tyner) and [Oscar Peterson](http://www.last.fm/music/Oscar+Peterson), he was the force behind the biggest evolution in jazz since [Art Tatum](http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Tatum) and [Bud Powell](http://www.last.fm/music/Bud+Powell).       His use of impressionistic harmony, his inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, and his syncopated and polyrhythmic melodic lines influenced a generation of pianists, including [Herbie Hancock](http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock), [Denny Zeitlin](http://www.last.fm/music/Denny+Zeitlin), [Chick Corea](http://www.last.fm/music/Chick+Corea), and [Keith Jarrett](http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Jarrett), and his work continues to inspire younger pianists such as [Fred Hersch](http://www.last.fm/music/Fred+Hersch), [Bill Charlap](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Charlap), and [Lyle Mays](http://www.last.fm/music/Lyle+Mays), as well as other musicians such as guitarist [John McLaughlin](http://www.last.fm/music/John+McLaughlin).      He worked briefly with [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis) and was the pianist on all but one track of _[Kind of Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/Kind+of+Blue)_ (1959). In fact, although “[Blue in Green](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/_/Blue+in+Green)” is credited to Davis, Evans always claimed that it was his own composition and that some years later Davis gave him $25 as compensation for lost royalties.      Evans won seven Grammys during his career, the first for _[Conversations With Myself](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Evans/Conversations+With+Myself)_ (1963) although not for his most celebrated work, _[Sunday At The Village Vanguard](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Evans/Sunday+At+The+Village+Vanguard)_ (1961) with bassist [Scott LaFaro](http://www.last.fm/music/Scott+LaFaro) and drummer [Paul Motian](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Motian).      In 1994, Bill Evans was posthumously awarded a “Lifetime Achievement Award” by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) “for altering the course of jazz piano with his lyrical, impressionistic solo and trio recordings, characterised by the understated intensity, distinctive chord voicings, and unique harmonic sensibility that opened up the vocabulary of modern jazz”.         **2.)** Bill Evans (born 9th February 1958 in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, USA) is an American jazz saxophonist. His father was a classical piano prodigy and until junior high school Evans studied classical clarinet. Early in his studies he was able to hear such artists as [Sonny Stitt](http://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+Stitt) and [Stan Getz](http://www.last
