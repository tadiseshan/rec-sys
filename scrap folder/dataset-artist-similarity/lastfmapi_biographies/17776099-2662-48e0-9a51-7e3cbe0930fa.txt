Georgie Fame (b. June 26, 1943) is a British rhythm and blues and jazz singer and keyboard player whose real name is Clive Powell.      Fame was born in Leigh in Lancashire. At sixteen years of age he entered into a management agreement with Larry Parnes, who gave artists new names such as Marty Wilde and [Billy Fury](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Fury). Fame was already playing piano for Billy Fury in a backing band called [The Blue Flames](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Blue+Flames), which later became billed as “[Georgie Fame & The Blue Flames](http://www.last.fm/music/Georgie+Fame+&+The+Blue+Flames)”. The band had great success with rhythm and blues. Their greatest success was “The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde” in 1968, which was a number-one hit in the United Kingdom and in the United States; they also had UK number-one hits with “Yeh, Yeh” (1965) and “Get Away” (1966). Although he enjoyed regular chart success with singles in the late 60s, it was a peculiar quirk of chart statistics that his only three Top 10 hits all made number one.      Fame continued playing into the 1970s, enjoying a hit with Alan Price (ex- keyboard player of The Animals), “Rosetta”, in 1971. He has also toured as one of the Rhythm Kings, with his friend Bill Wyman playing bass.      From the late 1980s, until the 1997 album The Healing Game he was a core member of Van Morrison’s band, as well as his musical producer, playing keyboards and singing harmony vocals on tracks like “In the Days before Rock ‘n’ Roll”, whilst still recording and touring as an artist in his own right. He frequently plays residences at jazz clubs such as Ronnie Scott’s. He has also played organ on Starclub’s album…      Georgie Fame’s swinging, surprisingly credible blend of jazz and American R&B earned him a substantial following in his native U.K., where he scored three number one singles during the ’60s. Fame played piano and organ in addition to singing, and was influenced by the likes of Mose Allison, Booker T. & the MG’s, and Louis Jordan. Early in his career, he also peppered his repertoire with Jamaican ska and bluebeat tunes, helping to popularize that genre in England; during his later years, he was one of the few jazz singers of any stripe to take an interest in the vanishing art of vocalese, and earned much general respect from jazz critics on both sides of the Atlantic.      Fame was born Clive Powell on June 26, 1943, in Leigh, Lancashire (near Manchester, England). He began playing piano at a young age, and performed with several groups around Manchester as a teenager, when he was particularly fond of Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis. In 1959, his family moved to London, where the 16 year old was discovered by songwriter Lionel Bart (best known for the musical Oliver). Bart took Powell to talent manager Larry Parnes, who promoted British rockers like Billy Fury, Marty Wilde, Johnny Gentle, and Vince Eager
