Novos Baianos (or Os Novos Bahianos prior to 1972) was a Brazilian [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) and [mpb](http://www.last.fm/tag/mpb) group from Bahia that was formed in the 1969 and enjoyed success throughout most of the ’70s. Band members were [Paulinho Boca de Cantor](http://www.last.fm/music/Paulinho+Boca+de+Cantor), [Pepeu Gomes](http://www.last.fm/music/Pepeu+Gomes), [Moraes Moreira](http://www.last.fm/music/Moraes+Moreira), [Dadi](http://www.last.fm/music/Dadi), [Luiz Galvão](http://www.last.fm/music/Luiz+Galv%C3%A3o), [Jorginho Gomes](http://www.last.fm/music/Jorginho+Gomes), and [Baby Consuelo](http://www.last.fm/music/Baby+Consuelo), today known as [Baby Do Brasil](http://www.last.fm/music/Baby+Do+Brasil).      Initially their sound was a fusion of [psychedelic rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/psychedelic%20rock) with traditional folk sounds, Brazilian as well as Latin, a style that is most evident in [É Ferro Na Boneca](http://www.last.fm/music/Novos+Baianos/%C3%89+Ferro+Na+Boneca) (1970). Their music began to gravitate more towards MPB, particularly due to [João Gilberto](http://www.last.fm/music/Jo%C3%A3o+Gilberto)’s influence, who frequently visited the group. Their 1972 album [Acabou Chorare](http://www.last.fm/music/Novos+Baianos/Acabou+Chorare) contained the classic [Preta Pretinha](http://www.last.fm/music/Novos+Baianos/_/Preta+Pretinha). The group had a strong hippie image and in same year, they moved to a community in Jacarepaguá. They left [Som Livre](http://www.last.fm/label/Som+Livre) and joined the [Continental](http://www.last.fm/label/Continental) label in 1973. The band released records until their break-up in 1979.      The album “Acabou Chorare” was elected in 2007 as the best Brazilian music album of all time.
