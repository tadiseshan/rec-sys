Known under a plethora of pseudonyms, he is one of the most prolific and critically acclaimed hip hop producers of the 2000s and has collaborated with myriad hip hop artists, including [Tha Alkaholiks](http://www.last.fm/music/Tha+Alkaholiks), [Mos Def](http://www.last.fm/music/Mos+Def), [De La Soul](http://www.last.fm/music/De+La+Soul), [Ghostface Killah](http://www.last.fm/music/Ghostface+Killah), [Talib Kweli](http://www.last.fm/music/Talib+Kweli), [A.G.](http://www.last.fm/music/A.G.), [MF DOOM](http://www.last.fm/music/MF+DOOM) (as [Madvillain](http://www.last.fm/music/Madvillain)), and the late [J Dilla](http://www.last.fm/music/J+Dilla) (as [Jaylib](http://www.last.fm/music/Jaylib)). Madlib has described himself as a “DJ first, producer second, and MC last”, and he has done several projects as a DJ, mixer, or remixer. Madlib has been an influence on an upcoming generation of producers and musicians, many of whom prefer Madlib’s abstract styles.      **Early life and career**   Madlib was born in Oxnard, California to musician parents Otis Jackson, Sr. and Dora Sinesca Jackson. He was raised in Oxnard, where he began his music career, and currently works in Los Angeles. In the early 90s Madlib began producing hip-hop music with friends that formed a loose-knit collective that came to be known as CDP - rappers that worked with Madlib in his Oxnard-based “Crate Diggas Palace” studio. His first commercially released music was production for the rap group [Tha Alkaholiks](http://www.last.fm/music/Tha+Alkaholiks) in 1993. The first commercially released music of his own was with the group [Lootpack](http://www.last.fm/music/Lootpack) with the 12-inch EP “[Ill Psyche Move](http://www.last.fm/music/Lootpack/Ill+Psyche+Move),” released by Madlib’s father in 1995 on a label he called Crate Diggas Palace. This record caught the attention of [Peanut Butter Wolf](http://www.last.fm/music/Peanut+Butter+Wolf), founder of the [Stones Throw Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Stones+Throw+Records) label, who signed the group in 1998.      **Stones Throw, Quasimoto and J Dilla Years**   The Lootpack’s 1999 debut album, full-length album, ushered in a string of releases on Stones Throw centering around Madlib’s production work which would continue for a decade. His first solo work, under the guise of [Quasimoto](http://www.last.fm/music/Quasimoto), [The Unseen](http://www.last.fm/music/Quasimoto/The+Unseen), came in 2000. The album was met with critical acclaim, named by _Spin_ Magazine as one of the top 20 albums of the year.      In 2001, Madlib took a turn away from hip-hop music, beginning a series of releases from [Yesterdays New Quintet](http://www.last
