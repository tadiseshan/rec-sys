**Anthony Braxton** (born June 4, 1945) is an American [composer](http://www.last.fm/tag/composer), [saxophonist](http://www.last.fm/tag/saxophonist), [clarinetist](http://www.last.fm/tag/clarinetist), [flautist](http://www.last.fm/tag/flautist), [pianist](http://www.last.fm/tag/pianist) and philosopher. He has created a large body of highly complex work. Braxton is one of the most prolific American musicians/composers to date, having released well over 100 albums since the 1960s. Among the vast array of instruments he utilizes are the flute; the sopranino, soprano, C-Melody, F alto, E-flat alto, baritone, bass, and contrabass saxophones; and the E-flat, B-flat, and contrabass clarinets.      Braxton’s music is difficult to categorize, and because of this, he likes to reference his works (and the works of his collaborators and students) as simply “creative music.” He has claimed in numerous interviews that he is not a jazz musician, though many of his works have been jazz and improvisation oriented, and he has released many albums of jazz standards. In addition to these, Braxton has released an increasing number of works for large-scale orchestras, including two opera cycles.      Braxton’s music is highly theoretical and mystically influenced, and he is the author of multiple volumes explaining his theories and pieces—such as the philosophical three-volume Triaxium Writings and the five-volume Composition Notes, both published by Frog Peak Music. While his compositions and improvisations can be characterized as [avant-garde](http://www.last.fm/tag /avant-garde), many of his pieces have a swing feel and rhythmic angularity that are overtly indebted to [Charlie Parker](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker) and the [bebop](http://www.last.fm/tag/bebop) tradition.      Braxton is notorious for naming his pieces as diagrams, typically labeled with cryptic numbers and letters. Sometimes these diagrams have an obvious relation to the music — for instance, on the album [For Trio](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+Braxton/For+Trio) the diagram-title indicates the physical positions of the performers — a variation on aleatory music that presaged his follower [John Zorn](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Zorn)’s [Xu Feng: John Zorn’s Game Pieces, Volume I](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Zorn/Xu+Feng:+John+Zorn%27s+Game+Piece s,+Volume+I) and [Cobra: John Zorn’s Game Pieces, Volume 2](http://www.last.fm /music/John+Zorn/Cobra:+John+Zorn%27s+Game+Pieces,+Volume+2) — but in many cases the diagram-titles remain inscrutable. The titles can themselves be musical notation indicating to the performer how a piece is played. Sometimes the letters are identifiable as the initials of Braxton’s friends and musical colleagues.      Braxton has pointedly refused to explain their significance, claiming that he himself is still discovering their meaning
