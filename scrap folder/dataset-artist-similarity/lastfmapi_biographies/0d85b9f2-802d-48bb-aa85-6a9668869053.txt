Anthony Moses Davis (born August 22, 1973 in Kingston, Jamaica), better known by the stage name Beenie Man, is a well established reggae artist and DJ. He was involved in the music industry from a young age when he won the Tastee Talent contest in 1981. Only one year later, when he was eight years old, he recorded a single, “Too Fancy”, with record producer “Junjo” Lawes. By 1983, Beenie Man was recording with heavyweight DJs, such as [Dillinger](http://www.last.fm/music/Dillinger) and [Fathead](http://www.last.fm/music/Fathead) and released his debut album, The Invincible Beenie Man: The Ten Year Old DJ Wonder and the single “Over the Sea”.      He was booed off stage at a show celebrating the visit of Nelson Mandela. In 1993 at the very popular show Sting he accused fellow deejay [Bounty Killer](http://www.last.fm/music/Bounty+Killer) that the elder artist had stolen his catchphrase, “people dead”. This triggered a lyrical battle which continued on the air with each artist counteracting the other’s songs. Finally, in 1995, Beenie Man and Bounty Killer settled their differences on the air by actually signing a peace treaty and the two recorded an album together, Guns Out. This was followed by a single, “No Mama No Cry”, a rehash of the Bob Marley classic “No Woman No Cry”, speaking out against violence and inspired by the murder of [Pan Head](http://www.last.fm/music/Pan+Head), another popular Deejay.      Partially as a result of prodding from his producers, Sly and Robbie, Beenie Man soon converted to the Rastafari movement.      In 1994, he was signed by Island Records and released the critically acclaimed album [Blessed](http://www.last.fm/music/Beenie+Man/Blessed).      In 1995, Beenie Man released a remix of [Barrington Levy](http://www.last.fm/music/Barrington+Levy)’s “Under Mi Sensi” in the United Kingdom, and collaborated with [Dennis Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/Dennis+Brown) and [Triston Palma](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Triston+Palma) to release Three Against War and [Lt. Stitchie](http://www.last.fm/music/Lt.+Stitchie) on [Mad Cobra](http://www.last.fm/music/Mad+Cobra) Meets Lt. Stitchie & Beenie Man. He took another step up the ladder in 1996, releasing the seminal [Maestro](http://www.last.fm/music/Beenie+Man/Maestro), produced by Patrick Roberts and shot him to UK fame. During the period from the mid to late ’90s, Beenie Man dominated the Jamaican charts to the extent that he perhaps had a good claim to the crown of “Dancehall King”, a title only bestowed previously on [Yellowman](http://www.last.fm/music/Yellowman) in the early 1980s.      In 1998, Beenie Man signed to Virgin Records to release albums in the United States. His first American offering was The Doctor (1998). In 2000, Beenie Man teamed up with [Arturo Sandoval](http://www.last.fm/music/Arturo+Sandoval) and [Wyclef Jean](http://www.last.fm/music/Wyclef+Jean) ([The Fugees](http://www.last
