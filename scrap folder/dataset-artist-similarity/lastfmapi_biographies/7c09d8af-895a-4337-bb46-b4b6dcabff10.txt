David Nesta “Ziggy” Marley (born October 17, 1968, Trenchtown) is a Grammy- winning [jamaican](http://www.last.fm/tag/jamaican) musician. He is the oldest son of [Rita](http://www.last.fm/music/Rita+Marley) and [Bob Marley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley), the legendary [roots reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/roots%20reggae) singer. His mother [Rita](http://www.last.fm/music/Rita+Marley) called and baptised him David, but his father [Bob](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley) nicknamed him “Ziggy” in reference to his childhood nickname. Born in Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, Marley learned how to play guitar and drums from his father.      A native of Kingston, Jamaica, Ziggy Marley first sat in on recording sessions with his father’s band, legendary [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae) troupe [Bob Marley and the Wailers](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bob+Marley+and+the+Wailers), when he was ten years old. Joining with his three siblings to become The Melody Makers, Ziggy crafted his own soulful sound blending [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues), [rnb](http://www.last.fm/tag/rnb), [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) and [roots reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/roots%20reggae).      After their first two albums, Play The Game Right (1985) and Hey World! (1986), The Melody Makers earned their first Grammy (Best Reggae Recording) for Conscious Party (1988), an album produced by Talking Heads Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth which included the hit songs “Tomorrow People” and “Tumbling Down.”      Subsequent albums included the Grammy-winning One Bright Day (1989), Jamekya (1991), Joy and Blues (1993), Free Like We Want 2 B (1995), their third Grammy winner Fallen is Babylon (1997), Spirit of Music (1999) and Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers Live, Vol 1 (2000), which featured some of their biggest hits as well as a cover of Bob Marley’s “Could You Be Loved.”      While selling records by the millions and selling out countless concerts with the Melody Makers, including a recent European tour, Ziggy Marley has never lost sight of his foundation of faith, fellowship and family.      After two decades as the driving creative force behind The Melody Makers, Ziggy stepped out on his own with his first solo album, Dragonfly (2003). Never content to rehash the success of his past, Ziggy uses Dragonfly to explore new ground and create his own distinctive musical identity as a solo artist.      “Working on my own gave me a chance to take my time and experiment a lot,” Ziggy says of the material on Dragonfly.” It took one year to finish this record. It’s the longest I’ve ever worked on a album. It’s different when you on your own. At some point it’s scary and then at another it’s a drive that makes you focus more.”      Although the members of the most close-knit musical families often yearn to step out on their own, for Ziggy, a solo debut was not a long-awaited goal. “It’s not something that I wished for since I began doing music,” he says
