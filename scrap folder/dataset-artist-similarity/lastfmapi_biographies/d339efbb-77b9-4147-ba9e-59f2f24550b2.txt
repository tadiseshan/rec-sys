**[Kelly Brianne Clarkson](http://www.kellyofficial.com)** (born April 24, 1982 in Fort Worth, TX) is a Grammy-winning American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) and occasional actress. Clarkson recorded her debut album with RCA Records after having won the highly-publicized first season of the television series American Idol in 2002.       Though originally marketed as a [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) musician, she eventually developed a more [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock)-oriented image. Her debut album, [Thankful](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/Thankful), was released in 2003 and debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with almost 300,000 copies sold in its first week, now certified double platinum with over 4.5 million copies sold. Her first single, [A Moment Like This](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/A+Moment+Like+This), broke the record for largest leap to #1, shooting from #52 to #1, where it remained for two weeks. The second single, [Miss Independent](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/Miss+Independent), was also a success, hitting #1 on the US Top 40 Mainstream chart and remaining there for six weeks. Further singles [Low](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/Low) and [The Trouble with Love Is](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/The+Trouble+with+Love+Is) were released but failed to mimic the success of her previous songs. However, [Low](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/Low) managed to become a hit in Canada and reached #2. To date, [Thankful](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/Thankful) has been certified 2x Platinum in the United States, Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.      Her second studio album, [Breakaway](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/Breakaway), was released in 2004 and debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 and also at #3 in the UK album charts. It is her biggest selling album to date, selling over 6 million copies in the US and 15 million worldwide, making it the most successful album released so far by an American Idol alumnus. The first single in the US, [Breakaway](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/Breakaway), peaked at #6 in the Billboard Hot 100 and #22 in the UK. Arguably her biggest single from the album, [Since U Been Gone](http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/Since+U+Been+Gone) followed and peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #5 on the UK singles chart, marking the beginning of a successful worldwide music career for Clarkson.
