Winston Rodney (born March 1, 1945), also known as Burning Spear, is a Jamaican roots reggae singer and musician. Like many famous Jamaican reggae artists, Burning Spear is known for his Rastafari movement messages.   Rodney was born in Saint Ann’s Bay, St. Ann, Jamaica, as were [Bob Marley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley) and [Marcus Garvey](http://www.last.fm/music/Marcus+Garvey); who both had a great influence on Rodney’s life. Garvey in his philosophy, which Burning Spear greatly took to, and Marley in directly helping Burning Spear get started in the music industry. Burning Spear was originally Rodney’s group, named after Jomo Kenyatta, the first Prime Minister and President of an independent Kenya. As fame took hold the name of the group gradually became synonymous with Rodney.   Burning Spear is one of the strongest proponents of Marcus Garvey’s self- determination and self-reliance for all African descendants, thus leading to several album releases in commemoration of the African activist.   In 2002, Burning Spear and his wife, Sonia Rodney who has produced a number of his albums, founded Burning Spear Records.   Burning Spear advocates messages of honesty, peace, and love, which tie in with his religious and political messages of Rasta and black unity.         About Burning Spear         [Burning Music](http://www.burningspear.net/)      “I don’t know how other people see music,” reggae legend Burning Spear reflects. “Some people might see it based upon money, some people might see music based upon opportunity and access. But I see music as life. I see music as inspiration.”      For more than 35 years, Burning Spear’s music-thus, his life-has inspired people on numerous continents. Since the beginning, his songs have implored listeners to fight oppression in all its forms, to work at improving their own condition and to consider the social impact of their actions.      OUR MUSIC builds upon the Jamaican native’s legacy of musical activism. With its inimitable dancing groove, the album percolates and bubbles rhythmically in its call for unity between races, between nations, between individuals and even between business associates.      OUR MUSIC is the second album released on his Burning Spear label, following 2003’s Grammy-nominated FREEMAN. In the midst of its expected messages about love, oppression and African history is the title track, a public confirmation that his brand of positivity is tempered with a strong sense of self. “Our Music” is Burning Spear’s reclamation of his own artistry-a justification for establishing his record company and a challenge to all artists to commandeer their own future.      “A lot of artists just have no time to really look within the business section of the music business,” Burning Spear reasons. “There’s no one to really sit them down and give them some of that business understanding before they get into what they get into
