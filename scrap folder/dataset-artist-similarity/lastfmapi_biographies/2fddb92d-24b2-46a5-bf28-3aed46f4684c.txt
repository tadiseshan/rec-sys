**Kylie Minogue** (born May 28, 1968, in Melbourne, Australia) is an Australian [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) singer who rose to fame after starring in the Australian TV soap _Neighbours_. Whilst her cover of [The Loco-Motion](http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue/_/The+Loco-Motion) in 1987 reached the Australian #1 spot, it was the [Stock Aitken Waterman](http://www.last.fm/music/Stock+Aitken+Waterman) ‘hit factory’ which produced her first UK chart-topper, [I Should Be So Lucky](http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue/_/I+Should+Be+So+Lucky), in 1988. Throughout the late 1980s, Minogue was a phenomenon in both Australia and the UK, and also saw success in Asia and Europe.      Minogue went on to have the most number of consecutive UK top ten hits of any new artist. However, she left Stock Aitken Waterman and PWL Studios in 1992 and signed with Deconstruction (through BMG). Her next single, “Confide in Me”, reached number one in Australia and was a hit in several European countries in 1994, and a duet with [Nick Cave](http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Cave), “Where the Wild Roses Grow”, brought Minogue a greater degree of artistic credibility. Drawing inspiration from a range of musical styles and artists, Minogue took creative control over the songwriting for her next album, Impossible Princess (1997). Parting ways with Deconstruction, she spent a short time in the musical wilderness before pulling on a pair of gold hotpants and returning to her pop roots with the #1 hit [Spinning Around](http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue/_/Spinning+Around). Her music videos showed a more sexually provocative and flirtatious personality and several hit singles followed.      Minogue’s biggest hit to date is [Can’t Get You Out of My Head](http://www.las t.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue/_/Can%27t+Get+You+Out+of+My+Head), from the globally successful album _[Fever](http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue/Fever)_. It reached #1 in 40 countries, including the US, a market in which Minogue had previously received little recognition and has sold over ten million copies worldwide. She has become one of the most successful female recording artists in the world with #1 hits spanning three decades, and is considered a national treasure in both the UK and her native Australia.      In 2005, midway through her _Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour_, Minogue was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, causing her to halt the Australian leg of her tour. The news shocked both fans and non-fans alike, and the ‘Kylie effect’ was felt by breast cancer charities - both in terms of donations and the upsurge of queries from concerned women of all ages. Through her personal suffering, Minogue had inadvertently increased global awareness of breast cancer issues
