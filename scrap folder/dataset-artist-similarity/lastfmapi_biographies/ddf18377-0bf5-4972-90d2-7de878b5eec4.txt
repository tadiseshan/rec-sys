**Marc Cohn** (born July 5, 1959 in Cleveland, Ohio) is a Grammy-award winning American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), best known for his song “[Walking In Memphis](http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Cohn/_/Walking+In+Memphis)” (often misattributed to [Bruce Springsteen](http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen) or [Michael Bolton](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Bolton)) from his self-titled 1991 album _[Marc Cohn](http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Cohn/Marc+Cohn)_.       According to the [Walking In Memphis Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=67), Cohn was discovered by [Carly Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Carly+Simon) in the mid-’80s when he was with a 14-piece band called [The Supreme Court](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Supreme+Court). Atlantic Records signed him in 1989, but the first attempts to record his debut album with [Tracy Chapman](http://www.last.fm/music/Tracy+Chapman) ‘s producer David Kerschenbaum failed. Ten months later, he tried again, producing the set himself with help from the little-known Ben Wisch, who had helped him with his demos. Finally released in 1991 when Cohn was 31 years old, his self-titled debut album was a huge hit, thanks to the massive success of “Walking In Memphis.” Cohn won the 1991 Grammy for Best New Artist award, beating out both [Boyz II Men](http://www.last.fm/music/Boyz+II+Men) and [Seal](http://www.last.fm/music/Seal). Cohn never matched the chart success of this song, but like his musical heroes [Van Morrison](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Morrison), [Joni Mitchell](http://www.last.fm/music/Joni+Mitchell) and [Jackson Browne](http://www.last.fm/music/Jackson+Browne) , he remained a critical and artistic success as a songwriter and performer.      He has issued two other studio albums to date, _[The Rainy Season](http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Cohn/The+Rainy+Season)_ (1993) and _[Burning the Daze](http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Cohn/Burning+the+Daze)_ (1998), both on Atlantic Records. A self-released live compilation, _[Live 04-05](http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Cohn/Live+04-05)_ (2005), is being sold at concerts on his current tour.      He is the most famous graduate of Beachwood High School in Beachwood, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb. He attended Oberlin College as well. In addition, Cohn is notably married to ABC News journalist Elizabeth Vargas whom he met at the 1999 US Open after being introduced by Andre Agassi. Cohn and Vargas have two sons: Zachary Raphael (born on January 31, 2003) and Samuel Wyatt (born on August 16, 2006). Cohn has two other children— Max and Emily—from a previous marriage.      On August 7, 2005, Cohn was shot in the head during an attempted carjacking, following a concert with [Suzanne Vega](http://www.last.fm/music/Suzanne+Vega) in Denver, Colorado. He was hospitalized and released the next day. The remaining concerts on the tour were cancelled.      Cohn released _[The Very Best of Marc Cohn](http://www.last
