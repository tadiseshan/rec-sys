Despite a complete lack of formal training, Chambers has become well-known among drummers for his impressive technique. Chambers is particularly regarded for his ability to play “in the pocket” with many notable funk and fusion bass players. Chambers exhibits a style that is technically proficient yet, unlike many other virtuoso musicians, highly musical and groove-oriented.      Chambers began drumming at 4 years old, and was gigging in Baltimore-area nightclubs by the age of 6. In 1978 (at 18 years old) he joined Parliament/Funkadelic, and stayed with them until 1985. Since then he has played with most of the major figures in jazz/fusion music.      He is currently touring with Carlos Santana and makes appearences with his band Niacin.
