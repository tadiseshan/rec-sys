**Damien Jurado** is a [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) in the [indie-rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/indie-rock) tradition of Seattle, Washington. His music is regarded as being heavily influenced by [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) music. Over the years he has released albums on many labels; today his primary label is [Secretly Canadian](http://www.last.fm/label/Secretly+Canadian). He was once in the band, [Coolidge](http://www.last.fm/music/Coolidge), with Seattle’s [David Bazan](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bazan).      He often makes use of found sound and field recording techniques, and has experimented with different forms of tape recordings. In 2000 he released _[Postcards and Audio Letters](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/Postcards+and+Audio+Letters)_, a collection of found audio letters and fragments that he had found from sources such as thrift store tape players and answering machines. Also released in 2000 was _[Ghost of David](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/Ghost+of+David)_,, Jurado’s bleakest and most personal sounding record to date. _[I Break Chairs](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/I+Break+Chairs)_, (2002) was produced by long time friend, David Bazan. It was his last album for [Sub Pop](http://www.last.fm/label/Sub+Pop), and was a much rockier, electric affair. After signing for the Indiana-based label Secretly Canadian, Damien Jurado reverted to his trademark folk ballad-based style, releasing six more albums: _[Where Shall You Take Me?](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/Where+Shall+You+Take+Me%3F)_ (2003), _[On My Way to Absence](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/On+My+Way+to+Absence)_ (2005), _[And Now That I’m In Your Shadow](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/And+ Now+That+I%27m+In+Your+Shadow)_ (2006), _[Caught In The Trees](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/Caught+In+The+Trees)_ (2008), _[Saint Bartlett](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/Saint+Bartlett)_ (2010) and _[Maraqopa](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Jurado/Maraqopa)_ (2012).
