**Tom Verlaine** (born Thomas Miller, on 13 December 1949, in Morristown, New Jersey) is a singer, songwriter and guitarist, probably best-known as a founder of [Television](http://www.last.fm/music/Television).      Verlaine is often regarded as one of the most talented performers of the early punk rock era.      Tom Verlaine’s poetic lyrics, and his accomplished guitar playing technique were highly influential and widely praised in the music media. He and Television bandmate Richard Lloyd are one of rock music’s most acclaimed and inventive guitar duos.      Verlaine’s stage name is a reference to French symbolist poet Paul Verlaine.      Famed for his trailblazing work as the singer and guitarist for the seminal New York punk band Television, Tom Verlaine also carved out an acclaimed and eclectic solo career. Born Thomas Miller in Wilmington, Delaware in 1949, Verlaine was trained as a classical pianist, but gravitated toward rock music after an encounter with [Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Rolling+Stones)’ “19th Nervous Breakdown.” In 1968, he and bassist Richard Meyers (later Richard Hell) moved to New York’s Lower East Side, where they and drummer Billy Ficca formed the group [The Neon Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Neon+Boys). After the addition of second guitarist [Richard Lloyd](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Lloyd), the band renamed itself Television.      Beginning with their landmark 1975 debut single “Little Johnny Jewel,” Television became one of the most renowned groups on the burgeoning New York underground scene; though lumped together with the punk phenomenon, the band’s complex songcraft — powered by Verlaine’s strangled vocals, oblique lyrics and finely-honed guitar work — clearly set them apart from their peers. However, after only two albums, 1977’s classic Marquee Moon and the more subdued 1978 follow-up Adventure, Television disbanded, and Verlaine started a solo career.      He resurfaced in 1979 with a self-titled debut which featured the song “Kingdom Come,” later covered by avowed fan David Bowie. 1981’s dense Dreamtime earned significant acclaim, and even hit the U.S. album charts. Both 1982’s diverse Words From the Front and 1984’s Cover drew raves from the British press, spurring Verlaine to take up residency in London. After a three-year hiatus, he returned with Flash Light, regarded as one of his best solo efforts. Following 1990’s The Wonder, Television briefly reformed for a self-titled album and tour; the group again broke up, however, and in 1992 Verlaine issued his first instrumental LP, Warm and Cool. In 1994, he composed the score for the film Love and a .45. Currently, he and his jazz-influenced punk guitar are touring. He is responsible in part for popularizing the Fender Jazzmaster, along with [Elvis Costello](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello). In 1997 he was asked by Jeff Buckley to produce his follow up album to “Grace”, “Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk”
