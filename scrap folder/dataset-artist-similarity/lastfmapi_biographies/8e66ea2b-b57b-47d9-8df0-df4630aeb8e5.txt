Peter Gabriel (born Peter Brian Gabriel on 13 February 1950) is an internationally-famous award-winning English singer, musician, and songwriter who rose to fame as the lead vocalist and flautist of the progressive rock band [Genesis](http://www.last.fm/music/Genesis). After leaving Genesis, Gabriel went on to a successful solo career. His 1986 album, [So](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel/So), is his most commercially successful, and the album’s biggest hit, “[Sledgehammer](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel/_/Sledgehammer)”, won a record nine at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards. Throughout his career Gabriel has won numerous music awards, including three Brit Awards (winning Best British Male in 1987), six Grammy Awards, and thirteen MTV Video Music Awards. In 2007 he was honoured as a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his “influence on generations of music makers”. In 2009 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize and, in 2010, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis.      Gabriel founded [Genesis](http://www.last.fm/music/Genesis) in 1967 with fellow Charterhouse School pupils Tony Banks, Anthony Phillips, Mike Rutherford, and drummer Chris Stewart. After leaving [Genesis](http://www.last.fm/music/Genesis), Gabriel began to experiment with various elements of world music as the underpinning for his dense, poetic lyrics. Although he released a series of successful song-oriented albums, Gabriel 1, 2, 3, and 4 (aka Car, Scratch, Melt, and Security), he didn’t really hit a commercial high until 1986 with his now seminal album So and its slightly less successful counterpart Us. After this came a 10 year hiatus until the album Up came out. This was followed by the ground breaking Growing Up tour. There was a DVD released of this tour. His 2010 studio album is Scratch My Back.      Gabriel has composed and recorded soundtracks for films as diverse as _Birdy_ (which contained re-purposed snippets of his studio albums to date), _Passion: Music from The Last Temptation of Christ_, and _Rabbit Proof Fence_. He also sang the Randy Newman composed title song to _Babe: Pig in the City_ called _That’ll Do_. He recently contributed to the wall-e soundtrack, singing the end title song _Down to Earth_, and composing two other tracks.      He created one of the more innovative videos of its time for the song [Sledgehammer](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel/_/Sledgehammer), with the then-fledgling Aardman Animations studio.      He was also instrumental in founding the long-running festival organization WOMAD (World Of Music Art and Dance), and participated in the UK millennium celebration, for which he wrote the musical OVO. The recording studio he built, Real World, and the record label it spawned, have brought many artists from around the world to the attention of Western ears.      Gabriel also wrote the music for The Millennium Show which was performed throughout the year 2000 in The Millennium Dome
