Aesop Rock (born Ian Bavitz on June 5, 1976) is an [alternative hip hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20hip%20hop) artist/producer from Northport, New York, United States. He has released six albums: “Music for Earthworms” (1997), “Float” (1999), “Labor Days” (2001), “Bazooka Tooth” (2003), “None Shall Pass” (2007 ) and “Skelethon” (2012). He is also a member of the groups [Hail Mary Mallon](http://www.last.fm/music/Hail+Mary+Mallon), [The Weathermen](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Weathermen), Two of Every Animal and [The Uncluded](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Uncluded).      Bavitz was born in Syosset, New York and grew up in Northport, New York. While attending college, Bavitz initially recorded and released two self-financed efforts, Music for Earthworms (1997), a full-length featuring underground artist Percee P on two tracks. Bavitz also released a music video to “Abandon All Hope”, which was one of the tracks on the CD. The album sold over 300 copies, largely from a grassroots internet-based promotion at his website AesopRock.com and then-popular web portal, MP3.Com. It was a success. With the money he made from his previous release, he then released his Appleseed EP in 1999 which received critical acclaim in the underground hip hop circuit.[citation needed] Both of his early records were produced by long-time friend Blockhead, and underground producer Dub-L. He completed these albums while also working as a waiter.      After his breakthrough success in the underground hip hop and indie rap community, he was eventually noticed by the Mush label and obtained his first record deal in 1999, just a year after he graduated from college. Aesop released his first major album, Float (2000), with guest appearances from Vast Aire, Slug, and Dose One. Production was split between Blockhead and Aesop himself, with one track by Omega One. During this time, Aesop worked at a photography gallery. In August 2001 tragedy struck when Bavitz had a nervous breakdown. The song “One of Four” on his Daylight EP documents his struggles.      Shortly after releasing Float, Aesop Rock signed to Manhattan-based label Definitive Jux (commonly shortened to Def Jux), where he released Labor Days (2001), an album dedicated to the discussion of labor in American society and the concept of “wage slaves”. This album was most well known for its single “Daylight”. Because of its popularity, Daylight was re-released in 2002 as a seven-track EP, including an “alternative” new version of the song “Night Light”, whose paraphrased lyrics simultaneously refer back to, and stand in stark opposition to, the original’s. The song “Labor” (from Labor Days) was featured in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4; it also was the first album in his catalog to break through the Billboard charts, peaking at number 15 at the United States Independent Charts, giving Aesop Rock more recognition.      Labor Days was followed by Bazooka Tooth in 2003
