**Terry Riley** (born June 24, 1935) is an American composer associated with the minimalist school.      Born in Colfax, California, United States, Riley studied at Shasta College, San Francisco State University, and the San Francisco Conservatory before earning an MA in composition at the University of California, Berkeley, studying with Seymour Shifrin and Robert Erickson. He was involved in the experimental San Francisco Tape Music Center working with [Morton Subotnick](http://www.last.fm/music/Morton+Subotnick), [Steve Reich](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Reich), [Pauline Oliveros](http://www.last.fm/music/Pauline+Oliveros), and [Ramon Sender](http://www.last.fm/music/Ramon+Sender). His most influential teacher, however, was [Pandit Pran Nath](http://www.last.fm/music/Pandit+Pran+Nath) (1918-1996), a master of Indian classical voice, who also taught [La Monte Young](http://www.last.fm/music/La+Monte+Young) and [Marian Zazeela](http://www.last.fm/music/Marian+Zazeela). Riley made numerous trips to India over the course of their association to study and to accompany him on tabla, tambura, and voice. Throughout the 1960s he traveled frequently around Europe as well, taking in musical influences and supporting himself by playing in piano bars, until he joined the Mills College faculty in 1971 to teach Indian classical music. Riley was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Music at Chapman University in 2007.      While his early endeavours were influenced by [Karlheinz Stockhausen](http://www.last.fm/music/Karlheinz+Stockhausen), Riley changed direction after first encountering [La Monte Young](http://www.last.fm/music/La+Monte+Young), in whose Theater of Eternal Music he later performed from 1965-66. The String Quartet (1960) was Riley’s first work in this new style; it was followed shortly after by a string trio, in which he first employed the repetitive short phrases that he (and minimalism) are now known for.      His music is usually based on improvising through a series of modal figures of different lengths, such as in In C and the Keyboard Studies. In C (1964) is probably Riley’s best-known work and one that brought the minimalist music movement to prominence. Its first performance was given by [Steve Reich](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Reich), [Jon Gibson](http://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Gibson), [Pauline Oliveros](http://www.last.fm/music/Pauline+Oliveros), and [Morton Subotnick](http://www.last.fm/music/Morton+Subotnick), among others, and it has influenced their work and that of many others, including [John Adams](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Adams), [Roberto Carnevale](http://www.last.fm/music/Roberto+Carnevale), and [Philip Glass](http://www.last.fm/music/Philip+Glass). Its form was an innovation: the piece consists of 53 separate modules of roughly one measure apiece, each containing a different musical pattern but each, as the title implies, in C. One performer beats a steady pulse of Cs on the piano to keep tempo
