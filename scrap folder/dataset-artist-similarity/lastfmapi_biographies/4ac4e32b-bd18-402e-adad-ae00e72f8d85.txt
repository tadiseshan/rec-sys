Patrick Wolf (born Patrick Denis Apps on 30 June, 1983) is a singer-songwriter from London, United Kingdom. Wolf mixes electronics and samples with a wide range of instruments including viola, keyboards, ukulele, and percussion, all of which he plays himself to form a fusion of jazz, folk and electronic music.      He began experimenting with sound and four-track recording at the age of 11, eventually building an arsenal of instruments that included junk-shop organs and a home-built theremin. At the age of 14 he joined the pop-art collective [Minty](http://www.last.fm/music/Minty), a venture that caught the eyes and ears of Fat Cat Records, which went on to supply the youth with a computer and mixing tools for aid in his newfound audio experimentation. He left home at the age of 16 and formed [Maison crimineaux](http://www.last.fm/music/Maison+crimineaux) with his friend Fanny, which eventually found its way to France where the noisy duo played a show attended by electronic maestro Kristian Robinson (aka Capitol K), who went on to release Wolf’s lauded 2003 debut. With Lycanthropy reaching number 39 in the NME’s top LPs of the year, as well as receiving critical acclaim throughout Europe and America, Wolf decided to study composition at the Trinity College Music Conservatoire.      The results of that endeavor can be heard on his 2005 release Wind in the Wires, a dark collection of moody British folk and chamber pop with a chilly laptop sheen.      Wolf released his third album, and the first on a major label, The Magic Position, in February 2007. A concept album on the theme of love, the majority of it was written after the end of a long term intimate relationship. It featured collaborations with [Marianne Faithfull](http://www.last.fm/music/Marianne+Faithfull) and Edward Larrikin of [Larrikin Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Larrikin+Love).      His fourth album, The Bachelor, was originally supposed to be part of a double album called Battle (the other disc was to be called The Conqueror). It was released on 1 June 2009. Guest musicians included [Atari Teenage Riot](http://www.last.fm/music/Atari+Teenage+Riot)’s Alec Empire, actress Tilda Swinton, folk musician [Eliza Carthy](http://www.last.fm/music/Eliza+Carthy) and avant-garde electronic pioneer [Matthew Herbert](http://www.last.fm/music/Matthew+Herbert).      Wolf’s fifth album, Lupercalia, was released on 20 June 2011 by Hideout, a subsidiary of Mercury Records. [Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=23163) explains that the album title refers to the fertility and love festival which the ancient Romans celebrated between February 13-15 (the predecessor to Valentine’s Day).      His latest release is a double album entitled Sundark and Riverlight, celebrating Wolf’s 10 years as a recording artist. The album features acoustic re-recordings of songs from throughout his career, as well as previously unheard tracks.
