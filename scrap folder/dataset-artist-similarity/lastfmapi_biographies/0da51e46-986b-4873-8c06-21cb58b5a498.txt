Arnaldo Dias Baptista (b. July 6, 1948 in São Paulo) is a Brazilian rock musician and composer. Born from a lyric singer father and a pianist mother, Arnaldo studied classic piano from 1955 to 1959, double bass from 1962 to 1963, and acoustic guitar from 1963 to 1965. In 1966 he formed the influential [Os Mutantes](http://www.last.fm/music/Os+Mutantes) band with his brother [Sérgio Dias](http://www.last.fm/music/S%C3%A9rgio+Dias) and [Rita Lee](http://www.last.fm/music/Rita+Lee), where he played bass, keyboards and sang. Os Mutantes played a key role in the Tropicalismo movement. Arnaldo left the band in 1973 due to problems with LSD, and started his solo career in 1974. Arnaldo recorded two albums with the band [Patrulha Do Espaço](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrulha+Do+Espa%C3%A7o) between 1977 and 1978, and later resumed his solo career. Arnaldo’s recordings after he left Os Mutantes are sparse, but he is still in activity.
