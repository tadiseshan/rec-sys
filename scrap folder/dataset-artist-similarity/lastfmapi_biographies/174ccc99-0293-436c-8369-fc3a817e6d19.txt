The group was created in 2005 by DJ, programmer/producer and remixer [Carmen Rizzo](http://www.last.fm/music/Carmen+Rizzo), vocalist and hammered dulcimer player [Azam Ali](http://www.last.fm/music/Azam+Ali), formerly of the group [Vas](http://www.last.fm/music/Vas), and [Loga Ramin Torkian](http://www.last.fm/music/Loga+Ramin+Torkian) of the Iranian crossover group [Axiom Of Choice](http://www.last.fm/music/Axiom+Of+Choice). Niyaz is a Persian and Urdu word meaning “yearning”.      Niyaz’s music, described as “mystical music with a modern edge”, is primarily a blend of [sufi](http://www.last.fm/tag/sufi) mysticism and [electronica](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronica). Niyaz adapts Persian, Turkish, and [indian folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/indian%20folk) songs and poetry, including the poetry of Sufi mystic [Rumi](http://www.last.fm/music/Rumi), with electronic instrumentation and programming.
