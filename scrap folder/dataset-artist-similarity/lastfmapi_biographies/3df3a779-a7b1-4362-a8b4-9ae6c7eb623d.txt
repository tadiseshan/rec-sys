Academy award nominated John Debney (born in Burbank, California, United States, 18 August 1956) is considered one of the most sought after composers in Hollywood. His unique ability to create memorable work across a variety of genres, as well as his reputation for being remarkably collaborative, have made him the first choice of top level producers and directors. Debney combines his classical training and a strong knowledge of contemporary sounds to easily adapt to any assignment.      Debney’s career seemed almost destined for Hollywood. The son of Disney Studios producer Louis Debney, John grew up in nearby Glendale, Calif. where he began guitar lessons at age six and played in rock bands in college. Debney earned his B.A. degree in Music Composition from the California Institute of Arts (1979). After college, Debney’s professional entry into the business came from television composing legend Mike Post (_Magnum P.I._, _The Rockford Files_, _Law and Order_) who gave the young composer his start. Debney furthered his hands-on training by working with Hanna-Barbera composer Hoyt Curtin. With this experience under his belt, Debney went on to score television projects as diverse as _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, _A Pup Named Scooby-Doo_ and _Sea Quest DSV_, for which he won an Emmy for Best Main Title. In the early 1990s, Debney began to score films for indie projects. In 1993 he secured his first studio feature, the Disney comedy _Hocus Pocus_ starring Bette Midler.      Debney has proven his versatility with films ranging from blockbuster comedies such as _Elf_, _Liar Liar_ and _Bruce Almighty_, action adventures like _The Scorpion King_ and _Spy Kids_ (1 & 2) to dramatic features including _I Know What You Did Last Summer_ and _Sin City_. Although Debney had built an industry reputation as a talented composer, it was in 2004 that the rest of the world discovered him. Blending symphonic orchestra, a wide range of world instruments and the beauty of the human voice, Debney composed the landmark score for _The Passion of the Christ_. Strong in his faith, Debney was enticed by the idea of working on a project that held deep, spiritual meaning for him. _The Passion of the Christ_ became one of the top ten box-office grossing films of all time, and his emotional score for the film connected with viewers and listeners and debuted on Billboard’s charts at #1 on the Soundtrack and Christian Album charts and #19 on the Billboard Top 200. The record was certified gold by the RIAA and won the Dove award for Best Instrumental Album. The score was nominated for an Oscar in 2005. In July 2005, fresh off his success with _The Passion of the Christ_, he premiered _The Passion of the Christ Symphony_ in Rome, Italy. The performance featured an 83-person choir and a 96-piece orchestra, and included special guest vocalist Lisbeth Scott and woodwind soloist Pedro Eustache, plus solo musicians from both the film and the classical worlds
