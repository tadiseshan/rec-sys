**Rufus Thomas** (March 26, 1917 – December 15, 2001) was a [rhythm and blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/rhythm%20and%20blues) and [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) singer from Memphis, Tennessee, [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States), who recorded on Sun Records in the 1950s and on Stax Records in the 19[60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s) and 19[70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s). He was the father of soul singer [Carla Thomas](http://www.last.fm/music/Carla+Thomas) (best known for the classic song “_[B-A-B-Y](http://www.last.fm/music/Carla+Thomas/_/B-A-B-Y)_”) and keyboard player [Marvell Thomas](http://www.last.fm/music/Marvell+Thomas). A third daughter, Vaneese, a former French teacher, for years had a recording studio in upstate New York where she sang for television commercials.

From the 1940s onward, he has personified Memphis music; his small but witty cameo role in Jim Jarmusch’s Mystery Train, a film which satirizes and enshrines the city’s role in popular culture, was entirely appropriate. As a recording artist, he wasn’t a major innovator, but he could always be depended upon for some good, silly, and/or outrageous fun with his soul dance tunes. He was one of the few rock or soul stars to reach his commercial and artistic peak in middle age, and was a crucial mentor to many important Memphis blues, rock, and soul musicians.      Thomas was already a professional entertainer in the mid-’30s, when he was a comedian with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels. He recorded music as early as 1941, but really made his mark on the Memphis music scene as a deejay on WDIA, one of the few black-owned stations of the era. He also ran talent shows on Memphis’ famous Beale Street that helped showcase the emerging skills of such influential figures as B.B. King, Bobby Bland, Junior Parker, Ike Turner, and Roscoe Gordon.      Thomas had his first success as a recording artist in 1953 with “Bear Cat,” a funny answer record to Big Mama Thornton’s “Hound Dog.” It made number three on the R&B charts, giving Sun Records its first national hit, though some of the sweetness went out of the triumph after Sun owner Sam Phillips lost a lawsuit for plagiarizing the original Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller tune. Thomas, strangely, would make only one other record for Sun, and recorded only sporadically throughout the rest of the 1950s.      Thomas and his daughter Carla would become the first stars for the Stax label, for whom they recorded a duet in 1959, “‘Cause I Love You” (when the company was still known as Satellite). In the ’60s, Carla would become one of Stax’s biggest stars
