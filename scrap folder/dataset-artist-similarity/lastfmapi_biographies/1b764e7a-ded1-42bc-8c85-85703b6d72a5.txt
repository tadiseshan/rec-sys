Shelton Hank Williams (born December 12, 1972 in Nashville Tennesee) is an American musician. He is sometimes credited as Hank III or Hank 3.      The grandson of [Hank Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Hank+Williams) and the son of [Hank Williams Jr.](http://www.last.fm/music/Hank+Williams+Jr.), he spent much of his early years playing drums in [metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/metal) and [punk rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk%20rock) bands. In 1996, child support payments led Hank III to sign a contract with Music City giant Curb. Three Hanks: Men With Broken Hearts was issued shortly thereafter, which brought the voices of all three generations of Williams men together. While this may seem to be a nice beginning, it was quite different from what Hank III himself desired musically. Despite having been born in Nashville, Tennessee, Hank III has never had a preference for mainstream country.      While his name (and his uncanny vocal and physical resemblances to his grandfather) could have guaranteed him a thriving country audience, he had no patience for the often predictable Nashville sound, nor for even the minimal constraints on behavior his promoters required. His opinions on this subject are well summed up in the songs “Trashville” and “Dick in Dixie”.      His first album on his own, titled Risin’ Outlaw, was released in September 1999. Lovesick, Broke & Driftin’ was released in 2002. He had a great deal of trouble with his label Curb Records, with incidents as extreme as their unwillingness to either release his appropriately named This Ain’t Country LP, nor allow him to issue it alone, and his selling of “F*** Curb” T-shirts. Battles with Walmart had delayed the release of his third studio album, titled Straight To Hell, which will be released on Feburary 28th as a two-disc in two formats: a clean version (for Wal-Mart), and an uncensored version, which will be the first country album to bear a parental advisory sticker on the cover.      He plays country with his “damn band” and produces a rather different sound with [Assjack](http://www.last.fm/music/Assjack), which is a metalcore/psychobilly band. He is also the Bass guitarist in [Superjoint Ritual](http://www.last.fm/music/Superjoint+Ritual), with former [Pantera](http://www.last.fm/music/Pantera) frontman [Phil Anselmo](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Anselmo). [Superjoint Ritual](http://www.last.fm/music/Superjoint+Ritual) has since disbanded but III is still working with Anselmo on one of his many side-projects (like [Arson Anthem](http://www.last.fm/music/Arson+Anthem), mentioned below).      A number of “sub-sub-genres” have been coined describing his original sound, such as hard-twang, slacker swing, hellbilly, and honky punk.      Hank III has recorded the tracks “87 Southbound”, “Thunderstorms and Neon Signs”, as well as “Why Don’t You Leave Me Alone”, which were penned by Wayne Hancock, a musician who is often compared to him
