**Heather Nova**, born _Heather Allison Frith_, (Bermuda; July 6, 1967) is a singer-songwriter and poet.      Heather Nova is the Bermudian Songwriter who grew up on a boat in the Caribbean and went on to sell over 2 million albums in her 15 year career to date. She has released seven albums and has opened for artists like [Van Morrison](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Morrison) and [Neil Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young) as well as performed with artists like [Sarah McLachlan](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+McLachlan). She has also had hit records with co-writes featuring artists like [ATB](http://www.last.fm/music/ATB) (Renegade), and [Eskobar](http://www.last.fm/music/Eskobar) (Someone New).Her brother is the Reggae singer [Mishka](http://www.last.fm/music/Mishka).      By the end of the 1980s, after leaving RISD, Heather moved briefly to New York City (where she unsuccessfully tried to interest some major labels in a demo including Columbia , who rejected her, only to sign her five years later ), before moving to London, England. She has British citizenship due to her Bermudan origin. In 1990, she released her first recording, an EP called ‘Heather Frith’ — she had not yet changed her name by then. The name change came a year or so later after several gigs in the Netherlands, where, after finding out that the Dutch have trouble pronouncing “Frith,” she chose a name that would be easily pronounceable in every European language, “Nova,” her Canadian mother’s maiden name.      The new name debuted in 1993 with her second EP ‘Spirit in You’ and her first full album, ‘Glow Stars’. The success of the album led her to record and release her first live album, ‘Blow’, the same year, which she supported by a tour of Europe. A year later in 1994 she released what many consider to be her finest work to date, the emotional yet jagged album ‘Oyster’, for which she toured for almost two years. Another live album, ‘Live from the Milky Way’, was released in 1995, and after its release she toured for nearly three years straight, twice joining [Sarah McLachlan](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+McLachlan) and others on the North American Lilith Fair, which is a music festival with only female performers. Heather is also a frequent performer at European music festivals such as Roskilde.      In 1998, the long-awaited follow up to ‘Oyster’ was released. After the release of ‘Siren’, Heather took a break while various television show and film soundtracks licensed some of her songs and her record company (Sony Records/The WORK Group) released various singles from the album, which received only moderate play on America’s MTV2, Europe’s MTV and Canada’s MuchMusic and on mainstream radio, although she was popular on college radio. Also during this time, she recorded a version of the often covered [Billie Holiday](http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday) song, ‘Gloomy Sunday’, for the German WWII drama Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod
