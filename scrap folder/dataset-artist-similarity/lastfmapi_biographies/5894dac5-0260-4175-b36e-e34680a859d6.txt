**Angelo Badalamenti** (born March 22, 1937) is an American composer for film and television, best known for his hauntingly atmospheric work with filmmaker [David Lynch](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Lynch), whose collaborations include _[Blue Velvet](http://www.last.fm/music/Angelo+Badalamenti/Blue+Velvet)_, _[Lost Highway](http://www.last.fm/music/Angelo+Badalamenti/Lost+Highway)_ and _[Mulholland Drive](http://www.last.fm/music/Angelo+Badalamenti/Mulholland+Drive)_. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the World Soundtrack Awards in 2008.      Angelo Badalamenti was born in Brooklyn, New York, United States to an Italian family. He began taking piano lessons at age eight and spent much of his childhood listening to opera and classical music. He studied at the Eastman School of Music and at Manhattan School of Music where he earned a master’s degree in music. A classically trained performer, he spent the early years of his career playing the Catskills resort area, later writing and arranging for singers including [Shirley Bassey](http://www.last.fm/music/Shirley+Bassey) and country star [Mel Tillis](http://www.last.fm/music/Mel+Tillis). Under the pseudonym Andy Badale, he entered the film industry in 1973, debuting with the score to the action film _Gordon’s War_. Despite subsequent work on such features as _Law and Disorder_ (1974) and _Across the Great Divide_ (1976), Badalamenti remained largely unknown.      In 1986, Badalamenti was hired to compose the score for David Lynch’s _Blue Velvet_; subsequently, they continued their partnership, Badalamenti composing scores for films such as _[Wild At Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Angelo+Badalamenti/Wild+At+Heart)_ and _[The Straight Story](http://www.last.fm/music/Angelo+Badalamenti/The+Straight+Story)_. Arguably the most famous collaboration of theirs was the cult hit television series _[Twin Peaks](http://www.last.fm/music/Angelo+Badalamenti/Twin+Peaks)_, for which Badalamenti created one of the most distinctive and evocative theme songs in television history. The duo also wrote and produced a pair of records for ethereal chanteuse [Julee Cruise](http://www.last.fm/music/Julee+Cruise): _[Floating into the Night](http://www.last.fm/music/Julee+Cruise/Floating+into+the+Night)_ (1989), which contained some songs from _Twin Peaks_, and _[The Voice of Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Julee+Cruise/The+Voice+of+Love)_ (1993). They also staged an avant-garde musical theater piece titled _Industrial Symphony No. 1_, which was shown onstage twice in 1989.      In 1996 collaborated with [James](http://www.last.fm/music/James) vocalist [Tim Booth](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Booth), the fruits of their labors being the LP _[Booth And The Bad Angel](http://www.last.fm/music/Angelo+Badalamenti/Booth+And+The+Bad+Angel)_. In 2005, Badalamenti composed part of the score for the video game _[Fahrenheit](http://www.last
