Julian Lennon is a modern-day Renaissance man — a singer-songwriter and musician, actor, documentary film producer, philanthropist, and, as of late, fine-art photographer. Beloved by fans around the world for his beautifully crafted, melody-minded albums, Lennon released his sixth solo album, the self- produced [Everything Changes](http://www.last.fm/music/Julian+Lennon/Everything+Changes), in the UK on September 26th, 2011, through British independent label [Conehead Management Ltd](http://www.last.fm/label/Conehead+Management+Ltd). He also continues to pursue his love of photography, encouraged by the success of his first-ever exhibition, Timeless, which took place in New York City in 2010.      Born in Liverpool to late Beatle [John Lennon](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon) and Cynthia Powell, Lennon was given his first guitar by his father at age 11 and formed his first band at age 13 with school friend Justin Clayton, who has since played on each of Lennon’s albums. “Justin and I spent all our time learning the classic rock and roll songs, like ‘Roll Over Beethoven,’ Lennon recalls. “As I got older, I began to listen to the Beatles more carefully and became fascinated by the intelligence that went into their songwriting — the arrangements, melodies, and lyrics, which was great as I began to write my own songs.

Produced by Phil Ramone, the album was certified platinum and earned Lennon a Grammy Award nomination for “Best New Artist.” It also included two major hits, the title track, which was a fixture on the Billboard Top 40 chart for 12 weeks, peaking at No. 9, followed by [Too Late for Goodbyes](http://www.last.fm/music/Julian+Lennon/_/Too+Late+for+Goodbyes), which spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Noted film director Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, The Getaway) directed the videos for both singles, the success of which made Lennon an international star, necessitating a global tour of Asia, Europe, the U.S., and Australia. “It was bonkers,” Lennon says. “Coming out of hotels, people would literally trying to rip the clothes off you. I had spent my last year of school in the middle of nowhere in North Wales. To go from that to doing a world tour and having screaming girls after you was crazy
