**Ben E. King** (born Benjamin Earl Nelson in September 28, 1938 in Henderson, North Carolina) is an American [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) and [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) singer. He is best known as the singer and co-composer of “[Stand by Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/Stand+by+Me)”, a top ten hit in both 1961 and 1986.      In 1958, Ben Nelson joined a [doo wop](http://www.last.fm/tag/doo%20wop) group, [The Five Crowns](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Five+Crowns). Later that same year, [The Drifters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Drifters)’ manager fired the members of the group and replaced them with [The Five Crowns](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Five+Crowns), who had performed several engagements with [The Drifters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Drifters). He co- wrote the first hit by the new version of [The Drifters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Drifters), “[There Goes My Baby](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/There+Goes+My+Baby)” (1959). He also sang lead, using his birth name, on “[Save the Last Dance for Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/Save+the+Last+Dance+for+Me),” a song written by [Doc Pomus](http://www.last.fm/music/Doc+Pomus) and [Mort Shuman](http://www.last.fm/music/Mort+Shuman), “[Dance with Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/Dance+with+Me),” “[This Magic Moment](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/This+Magic+Moment),” “[I Count the Tears](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/I+Count+the+Tears),” and other [The Drifters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Drifters) hits.      In 1960 he left the group after failing to gain a salary increase and a fairer share of the group’s royalties. At this point he assumed the more memorable stage name **Ben E. King** in preparation for a solo career. Remaining on [Atlantic](http://www.last.fm/label/Atlantic), King scored his first solo hit with the stylish, Latin-tinged ballad “[Spanish Harlem](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/Spanish+Harlem)” (1961). “[Stand by Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/Stand+by+Me)” was his next recording. “[Stand by Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/Stand+by+Me)”, written by King along with [Jerry Leiber](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Leiber) and [Mike Stoller](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Stoller) was voted one of the Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America. “[Stand by Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/Stand+by+Me)” and “[Spanish Harlem](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E.+King/_/Spanish+Harlem)” were named as two of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and were both also given a Grammy Hall of Fame Award.      King’s records continued to place well on the [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) charts until 1963, when [british pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/british%20pop) bands began to dominate the popular music scene. His hits after 1963 were “[What Is Soul?](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+E
