Jonathan Michael Richman (Natick, Massachusetts, May 16, 1951) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. In 1970 he founded [The Modern Lovers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Modern+Lovers), an influential proto-punk band. Since the mid-1970s, Richman has worked either solo or with low-key, generally acoustic, backing. He is known for his wide-eyed, unaffected and childlike outlook, and music that, while rooted in rock and roll, often draws on influences from around the world.      Jonathan Richman began playing music and writing his own songs in the mid- 1960s. In 1969 he moved to New York City, where he spent time living on the couch of The Velvet Underground’s manager and working odd jobs while trying to break in as a professional musician. Failing at this, he returned to Boston. Having moved back, he formed The Modern Lovers. Other notable members of the group were keyboard player [Jerry Harrison](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Harrison) and drummer David Robinson, who later joined [Talking Heads](http://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads) and [The Cars](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cars), respectively. In 1972 they recorded a series of songs with [John Cale](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Cale) producing, including the seminal “Roadrunner,” which were eventually released on the group’s sole album, Modern Lovers, in 1975.      Shortly after these recordings were made, Richman broke up the band and embarked on his long and eclectic solo career. For a while he continued recording under the “Modern Lovers” name (or rather, the more telling “Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers” appellation), but all the members were different, and in the new incarnation were essentially his backing band. The sound of the new group was considerably different as well, focusing on acoustic instrumentation rather than the prior electric guitars and drums. The album Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers was released in January 1977, Rock and Roll with the Modern Lovers followed a month later, and Modern Lovers Live in 1978.      In 1979 Richman finally went completely solo. That year’s Back in Your Life was released under the “Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers” moniker, but this was true of only about half the disc—the rest was solo work. This album was probably the most extreme detour by Richman into eclecticism; after the odd but traditional acoustic rock of the previous albums, this one’s solo tracks showed off a string bass and Glockenspiel as main instruments.A few years’ hiatus ended in 1983 with Jonathan Sings!—memorably featuring a cover with Richman serenading a crowd wearing nothing but a guitar and neck strap. This was followed up with a series of pop efforts (Rockin’ and Romance, It’s Time for Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers, and Modern Lovers 88 from 1985, 1986 and 1988 respectively)
