Shayne Ward (born 16 October 1984 in Manchester) is an Anglo-Irish pop singer who rose to prominence in the United Kingdom after becoming the winner of the 2005 series of the talent show The X Factor.      Ward has six siblings, including a twin sister. Prior to his participation in The X Factor, Ward was in a band called Destiny with two women named Tracy Murphy and Tracey Lyle. They performed at pubs, clubs and weddings. Ward also reached the final thirty of Popstars: The Rivals.      During The X Factor competition, Ward was mentored by manager Louis Walsh. The Bookies’ favourite to win the show, he defeated duo Journey South and singer Andy Abraham in the final, screened by ITV1, by a margin of 1.2% of the vote, out of a reputed 10.8 million phone votes cast by viewers (since the programme was watched by an audience averaging 9.2 million people, it is likely that some viewers cast multiple votes for all finalists).      His first single, “That’s My Goal”, was released in the UK on Wednesday, December 21, 2005 and became the Christmas number one in 2005. It sold 313,000 copies on its first day of sales, making it the third fastest selling single of all time (behind Elton John’s “Candle in the Wind” and Will Young’s “Evergreen”, which sold 685,000 and 400,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively).      His second single was released on Monday 10 April 2006, and it reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart. His album was released on Monday April 17th, and it sold over 95,000 copies on the first two days of release. By the end of the week the album sold 201,266 copies at #1. The album sold 71,396 copies in its second week, and fell to Number 2.      Sony BMG released his debut album on 14 July 2006 in Taiwan and other Asian Countries. The self-titled album spawned 3 singles: That’s My Goal, No Promises, and Stand By Me. Since release, it has gone platinum and peaked at number one in some countries.      After the completition of his successful debut tour, Ward’s fourth single and first from his second album (“If That’s OK with You”) was given a release date of 20 August 2007, but was then delayed and became a double A-side single with “No U Hang Up”. It was finally released on 24 September 2007, and charted at number two in the UK being held off by the Sugababes with “About you now”. “No U Hang Up” and “If That’s OK with You” charted separately in Ireland, the former reaching number eleven and the latter entering at number one.      Ward’s second album, Breathless, was released on 26 November 2007, and after selling over 95,000 copies in its first week, debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, held off the top spot by his X Factor successor, Leona Lewis’s, multi-platinum selling debut, Spirit. In Ireland, the album debuted at number one (removing Lewis’s album from the top spot) a position it held for three weeks, and was later certified five times platinum
