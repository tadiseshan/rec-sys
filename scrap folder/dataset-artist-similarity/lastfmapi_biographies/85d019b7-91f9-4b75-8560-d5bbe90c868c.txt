Julie Roberts (born February 1, 1979, in Lancaster, South Carolina) is an American country music singer. She is best known for her 2004 break-through hit, “Break Down Here” and her 2006 remake of Saving Jane’s “Girl Next Door”.      Roberts began performing country music as a child. When she was in junior high and high school, she toured with her family, playing at festivals in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. She also performed at area nursing homes (where she developed an appreciation for blues music); and worked at Carowinds (a theme park in Charlotte, North Carolina) and Dollywood.      A graduate of Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, Roberts began working for Mercury Records, later becoming assistant to label head Luke Lewis. During her tenure there, she began perfecting her singing skills and recorded a demo tape. Producer Brent Rowan liked what he heard and invited Lewis to hear the tape. Lewis liked what he heard, but it was only after he asked for the singer’s identity that he learned it was Roberts.      Roberts was signed to Mercury Records, and her self-titled album was released in 2004.      A second album for Mercury, Men & Mascara, followed in 2006. This album produced two non-charting singles in its title track and a cover of Saving Jane’s “Girl Next Door”.      Her influences include Dolly Parton, Barbara Mandrell and Tanya Tucker.
