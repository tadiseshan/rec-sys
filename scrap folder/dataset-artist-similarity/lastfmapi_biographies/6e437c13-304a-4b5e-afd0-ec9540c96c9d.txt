Cory McKay (March 2, 1973), better known by his stage name Cormega often abbreviated to Mega, is an American rapper from Queens, New York. Cormega’s streetwise poetics and perseverance has made him one of the most respected East Coast lyricists.      Cormega was raised in Long Island City, Queens, forming childhood friendships with future rappers such as Nas, AZ, Nature, and Capone-N-Noreaga.      **1980s**   He was featured on Hot Day’s “Going Straight Up” from his album “It’s My Turn”. He was also featured on Blaq Poet & DJ Hot Day’s track “Set It Off” from their album “Without Warning” in 1991.      **1990s**   Cormega was sentenced to 5–15 years in prison for armed robbery in 1991. Despite his incarceration, Cormega gained some attention following a shout-out from Nas on his song “One Love”, from the critically acclaimed [Illmatic album](http://www.last.fm/music/Nas/Illmatic).      Cormega was released from prison on appeal after serving almost 4 years in New York’s Mid-State Correctional Facility. Following his release in 1995, Cormega became determined to pursue rapping. Nas included him on a song entitled “Affirmative Action” for his second album It Was Written. The song also featured AZ and Foxy Brown, and became The Firm’s first appearance. Based on his performance, he was signed to Def Jam and recorded an album called [The Te stament](http://www.last.fm/music/Cormega/The+Testament?ac=The%20Testament%20c orme). Based on the buzz from “Affirmative Action,” Nas, his manager Steve Stoute and producers Dr. Dre and Trackmasters joined to produce The Firm. Cormega was replaced with another artist, Nature, because either he would not sign a contract with Stoute or Stoute felt Nature was a better rapper. This led to an alleged altercation between Cormega and Nature. Cormega’s dispute with Stoute also ended his friendship with Nas. Following the end of his membership in The Firm, Alex Trojano contributed in producing his album The Testament. Meanwhile, following a falling-out over creative differences with his manager Chris Lighty and Def-Jam imprint Violator Records, his debut album The Testament was indefinitely shelved. During the recording for The Testament Cormega responded to Nas’ “One Love” in the form of a letter also entitled “One Love”.      **2000s**   In 2000, he was released from his contract and he started his own record company, Legal Hustle Records. Cormega vented his disappointment with Nas and The Firm in a mixtape song titled “Never Personal”.This song was never directly pointed to Nas, but the media made it look like that. In 2001, he released his new debut album, The Realness, which was acclaimed by critics. Many of the songs share a theme of betrayal. Nas responded to Cormega on his song “Destroy and Rebuild” from his album Stillmatic. Cormega retaliated with more mixtape tracks, “A Slick Response” and “Realmatic”. Nas revisited the Cormega beef in his song “The Cross” on the album God’s Son
