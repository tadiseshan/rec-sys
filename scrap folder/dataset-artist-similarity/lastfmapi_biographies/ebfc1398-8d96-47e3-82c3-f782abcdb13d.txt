**The Beach Boys** are an American [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) and [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band, widely considered one of the most influential groups of the ‘[60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s). Known as “America’s Band”, they are easily recognized by their complex vocal harmonies. Initially recording music that focused on Californian youth culture, halfway through the decade they shifted their attention towards melancholy [orchestral](http://www.last.fm/tag/orchestral) pop, and continued to experiment with other genres. With the release of 1974’s [Endless Summer](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Endless+Summer) they became a more popular touring act, playing their greatest hits. They have recorded 36 Billboard Top 40 hits (including four number-one singles), have had over 100 million sales, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.      Formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961, the original group comprised singer- musician-composer [Brian Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson), his brothers [Carl Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Wilson) and [Dennis Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Dennis+Wilson), their cousin [Mike Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Love), and friends [Al Jardine](http://www.last.fm/music/Al+Jardine) and [David Marks](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Marks). South African musicians [Blondie Chaplin](http://www.last.fm/music/Blondie+Chaplin) and [Ricky Fataar](http://www.last.fm/music/Ricky+Fataar) played and sang with the band on three key albums during the early 1970s. Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: [Brian Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson)’s mental illness, drug addiction and eventual withdrawal from the group; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group.      In December 2011, five of the group’s surviving members - Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce and David (But not Blondie or Ricky) - reformed in celebration of their 50th anniversary, announcing that a new album and a 50-date international tour had been planned for 2012. The tour begun in on April 24, 2012 with a headlining performance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.
