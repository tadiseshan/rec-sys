**Sonny Sharrock** (Warren Harding Sharrock; August 27, 1940–May 25, 1994) was an American [jazz guitarist](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20guitarist). He was once married to singer [Linda Sharrock](http://www.last.fm/music/Linda+Sharrock), with whom he sometimes recorded and performed.      One of few guitarists in the first wave of [free jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/free%20jazz) in the 1960s, Sharrock was known for his incisive, heavily chorded attack, his bursts of wild feedback, and for his use of saxophone-like lines played loudly on guitar. He had in fact wanted to play tenor saxophone from his youth after hearing [John Coltrane](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane) play on [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis)’ album _[Kind of Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/Kind+of+Blue)_ on the radio at age 19, but his asthma prohibited it. However Sharrock had repeatedly said that he still considered himself _”a horn player with a really f***ed up axe.”_      Sharrock began his musical career singing [doo wop](http://www.last.fm/tag/doo%20wop) as a teenager. He worked with [Pharoah Sanders](http://www.last.fm/music/Pharoah+Sanders) and Alexander Solla in the late 1960s, appearing first on Sanders’s 1966 release _[Tauhid](http://www.last.fm/music/Pharoah+Sanders/Tauhid)_. He collaborated several times with flautist [Herbie Mann](http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Mann) and also appeared uncredited on [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis)’ _[A Tribute to Jack Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/A+Tribute+to+Jack+Johnson)_, arguably his most famous collaboration.      Three albums under Sharrock’s name were released in the late ’60s through the mid-’70s: _[Black Woman](http://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+Sharrock/Black+Woman)_, _[Monkey-Pockie- Boo](http://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+Sharrock/Monkey+-+Pockie+-+Boo)_, and an album co-credited to both Sonny and his wife Linda, _[Paradise](http://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+&+Linda+Sharrock/Paradise)_, though Sharrock believed the album was embarrassingly bad and argued against its reissue). After the release of _Paradise_, Sharrock was semi-retired for much of the 1970s, undergoing a divorce from wife/occasional collaborator Linda in 1978.      By the 80s producer/bassist [Bill Laswell](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Laswell) coaxed Sharrock out of retirement, convincing Sharrock to play on his group [Material](http://www.last.fm/music/Material)’s 1981 album, _[Memory Serves](http://www.last.fm/music/Material/Memory+Serves)_. Sharrock and Laswell were also members of the [punk-jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk-jazz) band [Last Exit](http://www.last.fm/music/Last+Exit), along with saxophonist [Peter Brötzmann](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Br%C3%B6tzmann) and drummer and [Ornette Coleman](http://www.last.fm/music/Ornette+Coleman) alumnus [Ronald Shannon Jackson](http://www.last.fm/music/Ronald+Shannon+Jackson)
