[Grace Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones) (born Beverly Grace Jones on May 19, 1948, in Spanish Town, [Jamaica](http://www.last.fm/place/Jamaica)) is a model, singer and actress.      Raised in Syracuse, New York, she found success in the 70s as a model, working in New York and Paris (where she shared an apartment with [Jerry Hall](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Hall) and [Jessica Lange](http://www.last.fm/music/Jessica+Lange)), before rising to public prominence as a singer and personality.      Jones secured a record deal with Island Records, which resulted in a string of club hits. The three disco albums she recorded - [Portfolio](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones/Portfolio) (1977), [Fame](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones/Fame) (1978), and [Muse](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones/Muse) (1979) - generated dance singles such as [Sorry](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones/_/Sorry) [That’s The Trouble](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones/_/That%27s+The+Trouble), [I Need A Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones/_/I+Need+A+Man), and a classic cover of [La Vie En Rose](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones/_/La+Vie+En+Rose). During this period, she also became a muse to [Andy Warhol](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Warhol), appearing in his portraits and accompanying him to Studio 54 on many occasions.      As the 70s drew to a close, Jones adapted the emerging [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) music to suit a different style, a significant departure from her previous output that resulted in some of her strongest work. Still with Island, and now working with producers Alex Sadkin and [Chris Blackwell](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Blackwell) at Compass Point Studios, and with the considerable talents of [Sly Dunbar](http://www.last.fm/music/Sly+Dunbar) and [Robbie Shakespeare](http://www.last.fm/music/Robbie+Shakespeare) ([Sly & Robbie](http://www.last.fm/music/Sly+&+Robbie)) behind her, she released the acclaimed [Warm Leatherette](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones/Warm+Leatherette) (1980) and [Nightclubbing](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones/Nightclubbing) (1981). These included re-imaginings of songs by [Sting](http://www.last.fm/music/Sting), [Iggy Pop](http://www.last.fm/music/Iggy+Pop), [The Pretenders](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pretenders), [Roxy Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music), [Flash and the Pan](http://www.last.fm/music/Flash+and+the+Pan), [The Normal](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Normal), and [Tom Petty](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Petty), as well as originals like the innuendo-filled [Pull Up To The Bumper](http://www.last.fm/music/Grace+Jones/_/Pull+Up+To+The+Bumper) and the haunting [I’ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango)](http://www.last.fm/music/Gr ace+Jones/_/I%27ve+Seen+That+Face+Before+\(Libertango\)).
