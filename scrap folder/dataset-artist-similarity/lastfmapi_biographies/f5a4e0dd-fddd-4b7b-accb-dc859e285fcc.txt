Freddie Wadling (born August 2, 1951 in Gothenburg, Sweden) is a Swedish singer, actor and opera writer, whose over 30-year musical career spans from punk to classical ballads. Although he played in three punk bands during the ’70s and early ’80s (Liket lever, which roughly translates to “The Corpse is Alive”, Cortex and Straitjackets) and the controversial Leather Nun, his importance for the Swedish punk scene has been small - in contrast to his influence in the alternative/experimental rock scene. He didn’t receive mainstream attention in his homeland until 1988 with the Flesh Quartet. He was awarded the Cornelis Vreeswijk Prize in 2005.      In the mid eighties he was one half of Blue For Two with Henryk Lipp. BFT was a rock band with heavy dependence on electronics that released five albums that were a moderate success in alternative circles.   In the eighties he was mainly associated with the swedish alternative label Radium Records.
