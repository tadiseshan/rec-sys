Nicolai Dunger is a singer and acoustic songwriter from Piteå in Sweden. He has released eleven EPs and albums, singing primarily in English, and collaborated notably with [Will Oldham](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Oldham), [Mercury Rev](http://www.last.fm/music/Mercury+Rev), the [Esbjörn Svensson](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Esbj%C3%B6rn+Svensson) jazz trio and [Ebbot Lundberg](http://www.last.fm/music/Ebbot+Lundberg).      Biography      A former football player, Nicolai was signed by the Telegram label of Warner records, releasing two albums that did not sell enough copies to enable him to give up his part-time job as a gardener.      A meeting with [Ebbot Lundberg](http://www.last.fm/music/Ebbot+Lundberg) of the Swedish band [Soundtrack Of Our Lives](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Soundtrack+Of+Our+Lives) led to two further albums, a tour with [Emiliana Torrini](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Emiliana+Torrini) and the use of one of his songs in an advertisement for an oil company. This small influx of cash enabled the production of a trio of vinyl albums with the [Esbjörn Svensson](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Esbj%C3%B6rn+Svensson) jazz trio.      This steady production of somewhat experimental acoustic music attracted the attention of Americana luminaries Will Oldham and Jonathan Donahue, and a contract with the Dolores Recordings branch of Virgin Records followed. The first album on this label, Soul Rush with backing from the [Esbjörn Svensson Trio](http://www.last.fm/music/Esbj%C3%B6rn+Svensson+Trio) attracted some limited attention in 2001, but the next album, 2003’s Tranquil Isolation, achieved widespread, especially thanks to its input from [Will Oldham](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Oldham).      A third album, Here’s My Song, You Can Have It followed in 2004.      He is currently touring the USA with [Mercury Rev](http://www.last.fm/music/Mercury+Rev).
