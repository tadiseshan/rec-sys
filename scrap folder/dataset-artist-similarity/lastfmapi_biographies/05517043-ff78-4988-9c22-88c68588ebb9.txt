**[Paul Frederic Simon](http://www.paulsimon.com/)** (born October 13, 1941 in Newark, New Jersey) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. He first gained world-wide recognition as the writing talent behind the popular American [folk-rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk-rock) duo [Simon & Garfunkel](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+&+Garfunkel) formed with fellow musician [Art Garfunkel](http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Garfunkel). When Simon & Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon quickly began his solo career with the release of the self-titled album, _[Paul Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon/Paul+Simon)_. This was followed by _[There Goes Rhymin’ Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon/There+Goes+Rhymin%27+Simon)_ and _[Still Crazy After All These Years](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon/Still+Crazy+After+All+These+Years)_, both of which featured chart-topping hits such as [Loves Me Like A Rock](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon/_/Loves+Me+Like+a+Rock) and [Kodachrome](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon/_/Kodachrome). In 1986 Simon released the immensely popular _[Graceland](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon/Graceland)_, which featured the groundbreaking use of African rhythms and performers [Ladysmith Black Mambazo](http://www.last.fm/music/Ladysmith+Black+Mambazo). In 1990, he followed up _Graceland_ with the successor album _[The Rhythm of the Saints](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon/The+Rhythm+of+the+Saints)_ which featured Brazilian and Cajun musical themes. These albums helped to popularize [world](http://www.last.fm/tag/world) music as a genre.      He co-wrote the unsuccessful, but critically-acclaimed musical _[The Capeman_](http://www.last.fm/music/Songs+From+The+Capeman) with Nobel-winning poet Derek Walcott in 1997. His most recent album, _Surprise_, was produced by [Brian Eno](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno).      Paul Simon still tours occasionally, both as a solo artist and with his old musical partner Art Garfunkel. He is married to [Edie Brickell](http://www.last.fm/music/Edie+Brickell).      In 1994 Paul Simon held 14 sold out concerts in Nantes (France) with International professional fusion players: Nino Manore (Italy), Francis Mc Gowan (UK), Gissele Masarde (France), Nikša Sviličić (Croatia), and others.
