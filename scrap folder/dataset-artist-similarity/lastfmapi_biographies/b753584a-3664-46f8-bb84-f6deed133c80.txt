There is more than one artist with the name David Arnold.      **1)** David Arnold (born January 23, 1962 in Luton in Bedfordshire, England) is a Grammy Award-winning British film composer, best known as a composer for the _James Bond_ film franchise as well as scoring the cult television show _Little Britain_.      Arnold was a Bond fan from an early age and also a fan of Bond composer [John Barry](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Barry). In 1997 Arnold produced _Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project_, an album featuring new versions of the themes from various _James Bond_ films. The album featured a variety of contemporary artists including [Jarvis Cocker](http://www.last.fm/music/Jarvis+Cocker), [Chrissie Hynde](http://www.last.fm/music/Chrissie+Hynde) and [Iggy Pop](http://www.last.fm/music/Iggy+Pop). A version of “You Only Live Twice” by [Björk](http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk) was recorded but not included on the album. [John Barry](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Barry), the composer of many of the themes on the album, was complimentary about Arnold’s interpretation of his work: “He was very faithful to the melodic and harmonic content, but he’s added a whole other rhythmic freshness and some interesting casting in terms of the artists chosen to do the songs. I think it’s a terrific album. I’m very flattered”. Barry contacted Barbara Broccoli, producer of the then upcoming _Tomorrow Never Dies_, to recommend Arnold as the film’s composer. He has scored the three subsequent films: _The World Is Not Enough_, _Die Another Day_ and _Casino Royale_. As well as the scores Arnold also co-wrote the theme songs for _The World Is Not Enough_, _Casino Royale_ and the end title music for _Tomorrow Never Dies_.      David Arnold wrote the [Björk](http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk)-performed song “Play Dead” for the 1993 movie _The Young Americans_ (his first film score). The following year he scored _Stargate_ and _Last of the Dogmen_, with excerpts from the former ranking third in the most commonly-used soundtrack cues for film trailers.      Other projects David Arnold has worked on include: _Independence Day_ (1996), _A Life Less Ordinary_ (1997), _Godzilla_ (1998), _Wing Commander_ (1999) (themes only, score by [Kevin Kiner](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Kiner)), _The Musketeer_ (2001), _Zoolander_ (2001), _Changing Lanes_ (2002), _2 Fast 2 Furious_ (2003), the remake of _The Stepford Wives_ (2004), _Four Brothers_ (2005), _Hot Fuzz_ (2007), and _How to Lose Friends and Alienate People_ (2008).      Arnold also composed the theme music for several British television series, including the 2000 remake of _Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)_ and _Little Britain_. Arnold appeared in a _Little Britain_ episode as one of the advisors of the Prime Minister (portrayed by Anthony Stewart Head). In 2001, he provided a new arrangement of [Ron Grainer](http://www.last
