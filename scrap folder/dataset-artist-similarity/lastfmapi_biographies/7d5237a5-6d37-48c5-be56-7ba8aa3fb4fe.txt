Lynden David Hall (7 May 1974 – 14 February 2006) was a singer, songwriter, arranger, and producer. Born in Wandsworth, South London, he won the ‘best newcomer’ accolade at the 1998 MOBO (Music of Black Origin) Awards.      In 1999, he was the first U.K. performer ever voted “Best Male Artist” by the readers of Britain’s Blues & Soul magazine. His debut album, Medicine For My Pain, plus the singles Do I Qualify and Sexy Cinderella, had an instant appeal to soul fans in the U.K. and elsewhere, but it was not until his work got the remix treatment that he got his major breakthrough.      Hall appeared in the hit film Love Actually in 2003, where he sang at the wedding of the characters played by Keira Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Two years later, he released his third studio album In Between Jobs on the independent label Random Records.      In October 2003, Hall was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, he died on 14 February 2006, aged 31 from complications resulting from the stem cell transplant he received in Jan 05. Lynden was in remission at the time of his death. Lynden is survived by his Mother,Father,a younger brother, two sisters and his Wife.      Shortly before his death in Nov 2005 whilst in hospital, Lynden achieved his wish to help others suffering, by putting on the hugely successful LYNDEN’S WISH concert at Londons Jazz Cafe. For the first time ever the cream of black British music artists came together in Lyndens honour to raise money for two charities close to Lyndens heart, The African Caribbean Lukemia Trust and Rays Of sunshine, a children’s charity. Lyndens Wish, a registered charity, remains his legacy.
