Nicholas Edward Cave (born 22 September 1957) is an Australian [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) musician, songwriter, poet, author, actor and screenwriter, best known for his work with his band [Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Nick+Cave+and+the+Bad+Seeds), [post-punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/post-punk) band [The Birthday Party](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Birthday+Party), and Bad Seeds side project, [Grinderman](http://www.last.fm/music/Grinderman). He currently resides in Hove, UK.      Cave was born in the small town of Warracknabeal in the state of Victoria, Australia, to Dawn and Colin Cave. He has two brothers: Tim (b. 1952) and Peter (b. 1954), and a sister, Julie (b. 1959).      As a child, Cave lived in Warracknabeal and then Wangaratta in rural Victoria, Australia. His father Colin was an English teacher and administrator, with a love of literature, and his mother was a librarian. Raised as an Anglican, Cave sang in the boys choir at Wangaratta Cathedral. However, he was often in trouble with the local school authorities, so his parents sent him to boarding school at Melbourne’s Caulfield Grammar School in 1970. Cave joined the school choir under choirmaster Norman Kaye, and also benefitted from having a piano in his home. The following year he became a “day boy” when his family moved to Caulfield, a suburb of Melbourne.      After his secondary schooling, Cave studied painting (Fine Art) at the Caulfield Institute of Technology (now Monash University, Caulfield Campus) in 1976, but dropped out in 1977 to pursue music. He also began dabbling in heroin use around this time. In late 1978, shortly after Cave’s 21st birthday, his father was killed in a car accident. This affected him deeply, as is evident in his lyrics.         In 1973, Cave met [Mick Harvey](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Harvey) (guitar), [Tracy Pew](http://www.last.fm/music/Tracy+Pew) (bass) and Phill Calvert (drums); fellow students at Caulfield Grammar. With them he founded his first band, with himself as singer. Their repertoire consisted of [proto- punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/proto-punk) cover versions by [Lou Reed](http://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed), [David Bowie](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie), [Alice Cooper](http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+Cooper), [Roxy Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music) and [Alex Harvey](http://www.last.fm/music/Alex+Harvey). In 1977, after leaving school, they adopted the name [The Boys Next Door](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Boys+Next+Door) and began playing predominantly original material penned by Cave. Guitarist and songwriter Rowland S. Howard joined the band in 1978.      From 1977 until their dissolution in 1984 the band explored various punk styles, often with rapid development: from [Ramones](http://www.last.fm/music/Ramones) riffing; through Bowie-esque [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave); on to Post-punk expressionism (informed by [Pere Ubu](http://www.last
