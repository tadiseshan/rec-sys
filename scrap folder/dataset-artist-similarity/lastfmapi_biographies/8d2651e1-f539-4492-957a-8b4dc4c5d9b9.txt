Mississippi Fred McDowell was born Fred McDowell in Rossville, Tennessee, January 12, [yearformed]1904[yearformed]. He died in Memphis,Tennessee on July 3, 1972. He was a [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) singer and guitar player in the North Mississippi style.      His parents, who were farmers, died when McDowell was a youth. He started playing guitar at the age of 14 and played at dances around Rossville. Wanting a change from ploughing fields, he moved to Memphis in 1926 where he worked in a number of jobs and played music for tips. He settled in Como, Mississippi, about 40 miles south of Memphis, in 1940 or 1941, and worked steadily as a farmer, continuing to perform music at dances, and picnics. Initially he played slide guitar using a pocket knife and then a slide made from a beef rib bone, later switching to a glass slide for its clearer sound. He played with the slide on his ring finger.      A pure [hill country blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/hill%20country%20blues) musician, he played “just the straight, natural blues,” and he “do not play no [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll).” McDowell initially played the recognizable resonator guitar but, during tours and recordings beginning in the 1960s, he adopted the use of electric guitar and was probably the first original delta- or [country blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/country%20blues) musician to do so. McDowell’s style is distinctive and recognizable; perhaps the dirtiest sounding guitarist ever and one of the most influential. The slide guitar styles of [Bonnie Raitt](http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Raitt) as well as [Keith Richards](http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Richards) and [Ronnie Wood](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ronnie+Wood) of [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones), as well as Dan Auerbach of [The Black Keys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Black+Keys) are all heavily influenced by McDowell’s technique.      McDowell died of cancer in 1972 and is buried at Hammond Hill M.B. Church, between Como and Senatobia. On August 6, 1993 a memorial was placed on the gravesite of Mississippi Fred McDowell at the Hammond Hill Baptist Church cemetery by the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund.
