One of the finest guitarists to emerge after the death of [Charlie Christian](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Christian), [Barney Kessel](http://www.last.fm/music/Barney+Kessel) (October 17, 1923 – May 6, 2004) was a reliable bop soloist throughout his career. He played with a big band fronted by [Chico Marx](http://www.last.fm/music/Chico+Marx) (1943), was fortunate enough to appear in the classic jazz short Jammin’ the Blues (1944) and then worked with the big bands of [Charlie Barnet](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Barnet) (1944-45) and [Artie Shaw](http://www.last.fm/music/Artie+Shaw) (1945); he also recorded with Shaw’s Gramercy Five.      Kessel became a busy studio musician in Los Angeles but was always in demand for jazz records. He toured with the [Oscar Peterson](http://www.last.fm/music/Oscar+Peterson) Trio for one year (1952-53) and then, starting in 1953, led an impressive series of records for Contemporary that lasted until 1961 (including several with [Ray Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Brown) and [Shelly Manne](http://www.last.fm/music/Shelly+Manne) in a trio accurately called “The Poll Winners”). After touring Europe with [George Wein](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Wein)’s Newport All-Stars (1968) Kessel lived in London for a time (1969-70).      In 1973 he began touring and recording with the Great Guitars, a group also including [Herb Ellis](http://www.last.fm/music/Herb+Ellis) and [Charlie Byrd](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Byrd). A serious stroke in 1992 put [Barney Kessel](http://www.last.fm/music/Barney+Kessel) permanently out of action but many of his records (which include dates for Onyx, Black Lion, Sonet and Concord in addition to many of the Contemporaries) are currently available along with several video collections put out by Vestapol.      In 2004, Kessel died of brain cancer in San Diego, California.
