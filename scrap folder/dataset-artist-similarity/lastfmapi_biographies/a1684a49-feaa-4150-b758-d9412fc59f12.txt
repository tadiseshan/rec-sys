Mike Oldfield (born Michael Gordon Oldfield, 15 May 1953, Reading, Berkshire, England) is largely known for _Tubular Bells_, his groundbreaking album from 1973, the success of which also bankrolled Sir Richard Branson’s [Virgin Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Virgin+Records), for which _[Tubular Bells](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Oldfield/Tubular+Bells)_ was the inaugural release. However, his musical career has spread over more than 40 years encompassing a range of styles, with varying amounts of success. According to the [Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock](http://www.gepr.net/), his style is labeled as Oldfield Progressive.      Before Oldfield started his solo career, he formed a band with his sister Sally Oldfield in 1967 called [The Sallyangie](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Sallyangie) and at the start of the 70s played bass and guitar with [Kevin Ayers and the Whole World](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Kevin+Ayers+and+the+Whole+World), alongside Ayers, David Bedford and saxophonist Lol Coxhill. At this time Kevin Ayers lent Oldfield a multitrack tape recorder, and it was on this that Oldfield began to put together what would become _Tubular Bells_, although Branson at one point suggested “Breakfast In Bed” as a title.      _Tubular Bells_ is considered to be the first rock album to incorporate elements of classical composition, particularly the use of repetition with subtle variations in the minimalist style as pioneered by composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich and LaMonte Young, although these influences were filtered through rock sensibilities. Oldfield also claimed to have been inspired by Kevin Ayers’ observation that “there was nothing wrong with repetition so long as it was something worth repeating”.      Early on in his search for a label, Oldfield encountered Branson who was in the early stages of setting up Virgin Records on top of his existing chain of record shops, but after many rejections over the following year, Oldfield returned to Branson, who agreed to release it as Virgin’s inaugural release and allowed Oldfield to finish the album at his Manor recording studio. Oldfield was signed to a ten album contract that would have repercussions on his later career. The album’s success took hold when John Peel played the entirety on his radio program on BBC radio, and an excerpt was licensed for use on the film _The Exorcist_, giving it some exposure in the US market.      Mike Oldfield’s next few albums continued in the vein of _Tubular Bells_. _[Hergest Ridge](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Oldfield/Hergest+Ridge)_ was a more textured, pastoral work, though still with contrasting sections. It actually hit No 1 in the UK album charts in 1974 before its predecessor, which took over the slot, however in the long run it wasn’t received nearly as well as _Tubular Bells_. An orchestral version of _Tubular Bells_ was orchestrated by David Bedford and released.      _[Ommadawn](http://www.last
