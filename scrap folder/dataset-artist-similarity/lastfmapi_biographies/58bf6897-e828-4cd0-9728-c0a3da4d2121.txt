Andy Partridge (born Andrew John Partridge, on November 11, 1953, in Valletta, Malta) is a founding member, guitarist and chief songwriter of the new wave group [XTC](http://www.last.fm/music/XTC). He lives in Swindon, Wiltshire, where he was raised.      As XTC gained popularity, they had been on tour for the bulk of a five-year period ending in 1982 when Partridge, suffering from stress-related illnesses reportedly brought about by his wife throwing out his supply of valium, forced the band to stop touring.      Partridge also serves as the band’s de facto art director. Most of XTC’s album cover art is predicated on ideas conceived by him. For example, the back cover of Rag and Bone Buffet took shape after Partridge requested “lots of rusty junk” and proceeded to create a mockup of the band members with it.      In addition to his work with XTC, Partridge has released demos of his songs under his own name in the Fuzzy Warbles album series under his APE House Record label. Volumes 7-8 of Fuzzy Warbles are scheduled for release in 2006. He has collaborated (as performer, writer or producer) with numerous artists: a partial list includes [Peter Blegvad](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Blegvad), [Mitch Friedman](http://www.last.fm/music/Mitch+Friedman), [John Greaves](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Greaves), [The Lilac Time](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Lilac+Time), [Thomas Dolby](http://www.last.fm/music/Thomas+Dolby), [Duffy](http://www.last.fm/music/Duffy), [Joan Armatrading](http://www.last.fm/music/Joan+Armatrading), [David Yazbek](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Yazbek), [Voice Of The Beehive](http://www.last.fm/music/Voice+Of+The+Beehive), [Ryuichi Sakamoto](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ryuichi+Sakamoto), [Terry Hall](http://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Hall), [Cathy Dennis](http://www.last.fm/music/Cathy+Dennis) and [Harold Budd](http://www.last.fm/music/Harold+Budd).      Partridge also served initially as the producer for the English band [Blur](http://www.last.fm/music/Blur) during the recording of Modern Life Is Rubbish, before creative differences with the band led to his replacement by [Stephen Street](http://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Street).      In 2004, Partridge contributed the song “I Wonder Why the Wonderfalls” as the theme music to the short-lived TV drama _Wonderfalls_.
