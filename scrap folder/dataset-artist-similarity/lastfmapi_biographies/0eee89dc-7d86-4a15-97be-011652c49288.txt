**Conor Oberst** is an [American](http://www.last.fm/place/united%20states) [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) born February 15, 1980 in Omaha, Nebraska. He began his recording career in 1993 at the age of 13 and has since produced an enormous amount of material. Conor was deeply influenced early on by singer-songwriters [David Dondero](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Dondero) and [Simon Joyner](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Joyner). His first two albums “Water” and “Here’s to Special Treatment” were both released in 1994. [Rolling Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com/) has referred to him as “[rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock)’s boy genius.” His current project is [Bright Eyes](http://www.last.fm/music/Bright+Eyes), and he also served as the frontman to [Desaparecidos](http://www.last.fm/music/Desaparecidos) (a [punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk)-oriented side project). In August 2008 Conor released his first solo effort, titled Conor Oberst, in over a decade.      At fourteen years of age, Oberst became singer and guitarist of [Commander Venus](http://www.last.fm/music/Commander+Venus), an [indie rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rock) band. The former members of Commander Venus, [Tim Kasher](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Kasher) of [Cursive](http://www.last.fm/music/Cursive), Robb Nansel (who now runs [Saddle Creek](http://www.saddle-creek.com/)), and [Todd Fink](http://www.last.fm/music/Todd+Fink) of [The Faint](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Faint), would later go on to feature in many Saddle Creek recording groups. Conor was also a member of the band [Park Ave](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Park+Ave), which he joined after terminating the difficult relationship he had with [Megan Saienni](http://www.last.fm/music/Megan+Saienni), due to an affair with Maria Pantin.      Oberst was also guitarist and singer for the band [Desaparecidos](http://www.last.fm/music/Desaparecidos). The music and lyrics of Desaparecidos differ greatly from Bright Eyes, having more in common with punk rock than [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk). The lyrics are generally social and political commentary on the state of affairs in America, the pitfalls of the suburban lifestyle, and America’s love of capitalism as opposed to the more introspective lyrics of Bright Eyes.      Oberst is one of the founding members of the [independent](http://www.last.fm/tag/independent) record label Saddle Creek Records, which hosts and has hosted bands including Cursive, Desaparecidos, The Faint, [Rilo Kiley](http://www.last.fm/music/Rilo+Kiley) (who left to start their own label Brute/Beaute Records), Bright Eyes, [Son Ambulance](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Son+Ambulance), [Azure Ray](http://www.last.fm/music/Azure+Ray), [The Good Life](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Good+Life), and [Sorry About Dresden](http://www.last.fm/music/Sorry+About+Dresden), among others.      Oberst is currently involved in a boycott of Clear Channel Communications
