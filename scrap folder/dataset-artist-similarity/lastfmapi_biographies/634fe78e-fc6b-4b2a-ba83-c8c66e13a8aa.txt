**Brian Douglas Wilson** (born June 20, 1942 in Inglewood, California) is an American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), producer, and musician, best known for being the principal songwriter and co-lead singer for [The Beach Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys), co-founded with brothers [Carl](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Wilson) and [Dennis](http://www.last.fm/music/Dennis+Wilson). Once known for his iconic falsetto, much of Brian’s most well-known work is tinged with melancholy and existentialism. Due to his unorthodox approach to composition, arrangement, and recording, Brian is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and influential creative forces in popular music.      The first official release credited to Wilson as a solo artist was the 1966 Beach Boys single “[Caroline, No](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/Caroline,+No)” (b/w “[Summer Means New Love](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/Summer+Means+New+Love)”), due to being the single’s arranger and sole vocal presence. Around the same time, Wilson also produced cuts for other artists such as The Beach Boys’ spear counterpart [The Honeys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Honeys) (member Marilyn Rovell was Wilson’s first wife), and [Jan & Dean](http://www.last.fm/music/Jan+&+Dean), whose “[Surf City](http://www.last.fm/music/Jan+&+Dean/_/Surf+City)” became a #1 hit single. The 1977 album _[Love You](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Love+You)_ and the unreleased _[Adult/Child](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Adult%2FChild)_ (recorded during the same sessions) were tentatively considered for release as Brian Wilson solo albums, although the idea fell through. _Love You_ would be last Beach Boys albums to feature Wilson’s extended involvement for the better part of 35 years.      Brian’s solo career, despite a few false starts, began in earnest with the 1987 single “[Let’s Go to Heaven in My Car](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson/_/Let%27s+Go+to+Heaven+in+My+Car)” (b/w “[Too Much Sugar](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson/_/Too+Much+Sugar)”), featured in the film _Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol_. A year later, his debut solo album, the eponymous _[Brian Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson/Brian+Wilson)_, was released, at the time hailed as a 1980s equivalent of what is widely regarded as Wilson’s _magnum opus_, 1966’s _[Pet Sounds](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Pet+Sounds)_. A follow-up in much the same vein, _[Sweet Insanity](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson/Sweet+Insanity)_, was scrapped due to various personal issues. 1995 saw the release of two albums: _[I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson/I+Just+Wasn %27t+Made+for+These+Times)_, a collection of re-recordings seemingly meant to reintroduce him to the public, and _[Orange Crate Art](http://www.last
