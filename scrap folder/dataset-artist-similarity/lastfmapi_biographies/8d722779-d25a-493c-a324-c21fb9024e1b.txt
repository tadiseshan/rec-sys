[Snooks Eaglin](http://www.last.fm/music/Snooks+Eaglin) (born January 21, 1936 in New Orleans, Louisiana, died February 18, 2009) was a guitarist and singer in New Orleans. His real name was Fird Eaglin, Jr. He has also been referred to as Blind Snooks Eaglin.      His vocal style is reminiscent of [Ray Charles](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles); indeed, in the 50s, when he was in his late teens, he would sometimes bill himself as “Little” Ray Charles. He is generally regarded as a New Orleans R&B artist playing a wide range of music from blues, rock ‘n’ roll, jazz, country to Latin music. In his early years, he also played some straight ahead acoustic blues.      His ability to play a wide range of songs and his ability to perfectly understand and make the tunes his own has earned him the nickname the “human jukebox.” Eaglin has claimed in interviews that his musical repartoire to be as wide as 1,000 songs.      At live shows, he usually did not prepare set lists, and what he was about to play was totally unpredictable, even to his bandmates. He played songs that come to his head, and he also took requests from the audience.
