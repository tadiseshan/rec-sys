**Charlie Parr** plays original and traditional [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) and Piedmont-style [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues), accompanying himself on National [resonator guitar](http://www.last.fm/tag/resonator%20guitar), [12-string guitar](http://www.last.fm/tag/12-string%20guitar) and sometimes a [banjo](http://www.last.fm/tag/banjo). He was raised in Austin, Minnesota, in a household that prized traditional American folk music and his style bears the influence of hours spent listening to country blues records and Smithsonian/Folkways field recordings; often in the garage. He currently lives in Duluth, Minnesota.
