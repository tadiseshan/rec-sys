**Jean-Luc Ponty** (b. 1942) is a virtuoso French violinist and [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) composer.      Born on the 29th September 1942 in Avranches, France, he was trained as a professional classical violinist at the Paris Conservatory. His attraction to jazz was propelled by [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis)’s and [John Coltrane](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane)’s music.      He has worked with [Stéphane Grappelli](http://www.last.fm/music/St%C3%A9phane+Grappelli), the [Mahavishnu Orchestra](http://www.last.fm/music/Mahavishnu+Orchestra), and [Frank Zappa](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Zappa), and has appeared on over seventy recordings.      In 1977 Ponty pioneered the use of the five-string electric violin, with a lower C string. He sometimes also uses a six-string electric violin called the violectra, with low C and F strings – not to be confused with the violectra he played from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s which had four strings, but tuned an octave lower. He was among the first to combine the violin with MIDI, distortion boxes, phase shifters, and wah-wah pedals. This resulted in his signature, almost synthesiser-like sound.      In 2005 Ponty formed the acoustic fusion supergroup [Trio!](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Trio!) with bassist [Stanley Clarke](http://www.last.fm/music/Stanley+Clarke) and banjo player [Bela Fleck](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bela+Fleck).
