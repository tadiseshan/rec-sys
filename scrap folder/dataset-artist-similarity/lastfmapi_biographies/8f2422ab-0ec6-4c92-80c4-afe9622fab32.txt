Stan Getz (Stanley Gayetzky, February 2, 1927 Philadelphia – June 6, 1991 Malibu, California) was an American jazz tenor saxophone player. Known as “The Sound” because of his warm, lyrical tone, Getz’s prime influence was the wispy, mellow tone of his idol, [Lester Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Lester+Young).      His parents were Ukrainian Jews who immigrated from Kiev city, Ukraine in 1903. The family later moved to New York City for better jobs. Stan worked hard in school receiving straight “A’s” on average and finished 6th grade close to the top of his class. Stan’s major interest was in musical instruments, and he felt a need to play every instrument in his sight. He played a number of instruments before his father bought him his first saxophone at the age of 13. Even though his father also got him a clarinet, Stan instantly fell in love with the saxophone and began practicing 8 hours a day. In 1941, he was accepted into the All City High School Orchestra of New York City. This gave Stan a chance to receive a private, free tutor from the New York Philharmonic, Simon Kovar \- a bassoon player. He also began to spend more time playing the saxophone. He eventually dropped out of school in order to pursue his musical career, but was later sent back to the classroom by the school system’s truancy officers.      In 1943, he was accepted into [Jack Teagarden](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Teagarden)’s band, and because of his youth he became Teagarden’s ward. Getz also played along with [Nat King Cole](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole) and [Lionel Hampton](http://www.last.fm/music/Lionel+Hampton). After playing for [Stan Kenton](http://www.last.fm/music/Stan+Kenton), [Jimmy Dorsey](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Dorsey), and [Benny Goodman](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Goodman), Getz was a soloist with [Woody Herman](http://www.last.fm/music/Woody+Herman) from 1947 to 1949 in ‘The Second Herd’ and he first gained wide attention as one of the band’s saxophonists, who were known collectively as ‘The Four Brothers’, the others being [Serge Chaloff](http://www.last.fm/music/Serge+Chaloff), [Zoot Sims](http://www.last.fm/music/Zoot+Sims) and [Herbie Steward](http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Steward). With Herman, he had a hit with “Early Autumn” and after Getz left ‘The Second Herd’ he was able to launch his solo career. He would be the leader on almost all of his recording sessions after 1950.      During the early ’50s, Getz broke away from the Lester Young style to form his own musical identity and he was soon among the most popular of all jazzmen. He discovered Horace Silver in 1950 and used him in his quartet for several months. After touring Sweden in 1951, he formed an exciting quintet that co- featured guitarist Jimmy Raney; their interplay on up-tempo tunes and tonal blend on ballads was quite memorable
