An outstanding performer, his touch on rock and roll music is still heard to this day.   According to country musician [Charlie Daniels](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Daniels), “Carl Perkins’ songs personified the Rockabilly Era, and Carl Perkins’ sound personifies the Rockabilly Sound more so than anybody involved in it, because he never changed.” Perkins’s songs have been recorded by artists as influential as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Johnny Cash, which further cemented his place in the history of popular music.      Carl Lee Perkins was the son of poor sharecroppers near Tiptonville, Tennessee. He grew up hearing Southern gospel music sung by whites in church and by black field workers when he started working in the cotton fields at age six. In the spring and fall, the school day would be followed by several hours of work in the fields. During the summer workdays were 12 - 14 hours, “from can to can’t”. Carl and his brother Jay together would earn 50 cents per day. With all family members working, and credit, there was enough money for beans and potatoes, some tobacco for Carl’s father Buck, and every so often the luxury of a five cent bag of hard candy.      On Saturday nights he would listen to the radio along with his father and hear music from the Grand Ole Opry. [Roy Acuff](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Acuff)’s broadcast performances on the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar. Because they couldn’t afford a real guitar, Carl’s father fashioned one from a cigar box and a broomstick. When a neighbor in tough straits offered to sell his dented and scratched [Gene Autry](http://www.last.fm/music/Gene+Autry) signature model guitar with worn out strings, Buck purchased it for a couple of dollars
