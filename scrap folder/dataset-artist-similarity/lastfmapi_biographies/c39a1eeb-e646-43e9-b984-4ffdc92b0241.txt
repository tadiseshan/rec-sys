Tommy Flanagan (1930-2001) was a post-bebop jazz pianist influenced by players like [Teddy Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Wilson), [Bud Powell](http://www.last.fm/music/Bud+Powell) and [Hank Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Hank+Jones). Raised in Detroit, Flanagan came into high demand when he moved to New York in 1956. Jazz greats [John Coltrane](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane) and [Coleman Hawkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Coleman+Hawkins) both recorded with Flanagan for their landmark albums “Giant Steps” & “Today & Now” respectively. This confirmed Flanagan’s reputation for playing with versatility, and with a sensitive approach for the standards and ballads. From the mid 1960s to the late 1970s Flanagan was [Ella Fitzgerald](http://www.last.fm/music/Ella+Fitzgerald)’s accompanist, before beginning a productive period in the 1980s and ’90s where he led many trio and quartet projects.
