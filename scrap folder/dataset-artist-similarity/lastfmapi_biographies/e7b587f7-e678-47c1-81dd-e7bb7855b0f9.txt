Harvey Philip Spector (born December 26, 1940) is an American record producer and songwriter. In later years, he gained infamy as the subject of a murder conviction.      The originator of the [wall of sound](http://www.last.fm/tag/wall%20of%20sound) production technique, Spector was a pioneer of the 1960s girl group sound ([The Ronettes](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ronettes) and [The Crystals](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Crystals) a.o.) and produced over twenty-five Top 40 hits between 1960 and 1965 alone. After this initial success, Spector later worked with artists including Ike and [Tina Turner](http://www.last.fm/music/Tina+Turner), [John Lennon](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon), [George Harrison](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison), and the [Ramones](http://www.last.fm/music/Ramones) with similar acclaim.   He produced [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles)’ Academy Award-winning album [Let It Be](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Let+It+Be), and the Grammy Award- winning Concert for Bangladesh by former Beatle [George Harrison](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison). In 1989, Spector was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a non-performer. The 1965 song [You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Righteous+Broth ers/_/You%27ve+Lost+That+Lovin%27+Feelin%27), produced and co-written by Spector for [The Righteous Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Righteous+Brothers), is listed by BMI as the song with the most U.S. airplay in the 20th century.      The 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson in his Alhambra, California home led to his being charged with murder in the second degree. After a 2007 mistrial, he was convicted in 2009 and given a prison sentence of 19 years to life.
