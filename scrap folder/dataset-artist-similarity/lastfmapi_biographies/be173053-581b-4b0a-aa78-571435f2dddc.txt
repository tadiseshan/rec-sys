Duncan James was born Duncan Matthew James Inglis in Salisbury, Wiltshire) on April 7, 1978.      He is a singer in the boy band [Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Blue) and also a solo artist. He is openly homosexual.      James grew up in Dorset and was raised primarily by his grandparents. He starred in A Midsummer Night’s Dream when he was 15, and played Puck. He also played Dr Watson in Sherlock Holmes when he was a teenager.      In early 2000, James, along with [Antony Costa](http://www.last.fm/music/Antony+Costa), convinced [Lee Ryan](http://www.last.fm/music/Lee+Ryan) and [Simon Webbe](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Webbe) to form the group Blue. Blue’s R&B-influenced pop allowed the group to achieve commercial success in the United Kingdom and many other countries, including Italy, Australia, and New Zealand. From May 2001, when the group released its first single, “[All Rise](http://www.last.fm/music/Blue/_/All+Rise),” to 2004, when the group released its final chart-qualifying single, “[Curtain Falls](http://www.last.fm/music/Blue/_/Curtain+Falls),” Blue had 11 top ten singles in the UK.      Though Blue has never formally announced its permanent breakup, it split in July 2005 and all four members have moved on to solo careers. James has criticized the solo efforts of some of his former bandmates, referring to Ryan’s first album as “rushed” and Costa’s bid to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest as “cheesy.”      In October 2004, James collaborated with Keedie to release the single “I Believe My Heart”, which entered the UK singles chart at #2. He returned to the solo music scene in May 2006 with his single “[Sooner or Later](http://www.last.fm/music/Duncan+James/_/Sooner+or+Later)”, releasing the video in early May and planning to release the single commercially on June 5, 2006. The video reached #2 on The Box and #5 on The Hits.      Duncan James has a daughter named Tianie-Finn, born in 2005 to an ex- girlfriend whose name is only known as “Claire”. (He refuses to reveal her complete name) He has been quoted numerous times expressing his frustration with the media’s constant obsession with who he is having a relationship with. Nevertheless, as is true for many celebrities, his love life has been a focus of frequent media speculation.      James is now enjoying being a part of the boyband Blue again, they released the album Roulette in 2013 and have taken part in popular TV show The Big Reunion, which caused some controversy as they joined the show later than the other acts.      **Albums:**   [Future Past](http://www.last.fm/music/Duncan+James/Future+Past) (12 June 2006): #55 UK; #2 Italy, #25 Belgium, #30 Germany, #68 France.      **Singles:**   “I Believe My Heart” (October 2004), with Keedie: #2 UK   “[Sooner or Later](http://www.last.fm/music/Duncan+James/_/Sooner+or+Later)” (5 June 2006): #35 UK   “[Can’t Stop A River](http://www.last.fm/music/Duncan+James/_/Can%27t+Stop+A+River)” (August 14 2006)
