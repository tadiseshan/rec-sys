**King Crimson** are a progressive rock group from London, England, United Kingdom formed in 1968 by guitarist [Robert Fripp](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Fripp) and drummer [Michael Giles](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Giles). Though originally an all-British musical group, later members have included a number of Americans, most notably [Adrian Belew](http://www.last.fm/music/Adrian+Belew), and [Tony Levin](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Levin). The name “King Crimson” was coined by [Peter Sinfield](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Sinfield) as a synonym for Beelzebub, prince of demons.      King Crimson’s debut album was _[In the Court of the Crimson King](http://www. last.fm/music/King+Crimson/In+the+Court+of+the+Crimson+King)_. The first major success of the new genre of progressive rock, many bands that would come to dominate ‘prog’ in the 1970s first sought to emulate _In the Court of the Crimson King_, including [Genesis](http://www.last.fm/music/Genesis), [The Alan Parsons Project](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Alan+Parsons+Project), and later [Rush](http://www.last.fm/music/Rush).      The line-up of King Crimson has at times changed drastically from album to album. Original lead singer and bassist [Greg Lake](http://www.last.fm/music/Greg+Lake) left the group - as did lyricist Peter Sinfield - and went on to fame with [Emerson, Lake & Palmer](http://www.last.fm/music/Emerson,+Lake+&+Palmer) in 1970, replaced by [Gordon Haskell](http://www.last.fm/music/Gordon+Haskell), Boz Burrell, and, briefly, [Jon Anderson](http://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Anderson) of [Yes](http://www.last.fm/music/Yes). Also from Yes came drummer [Bill Bruford](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Bruford), who joined King Crimson in 1972 and became one of the more enduring members. For the next three years, Bruford and Fripp were joined by future [Asia](http://www.last.fm/music/Asia) frontman John Wetton. With comparatively few additional musicians, these mid- 1970s albums and performances showed a more raw and stylistically focused - though still improvisational - King Crimson. In 1974 the band split temporarily.      In 1981, bassist [Tony Levin](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Levin) and guitarist/singer [Adrian Belew](http://www.last.fm/music/Adrian+Belew) joined Fripp and Bruford in a band initially called Discipline. Changing the name back to King Crimson, the four released a trio of studio albums which preserved the classic heavy and improvisational sound, but also embraced 1980s musical influences and technologies.      In 1984 the band split up again, then re-formed in 1994 with former [Mr. Mister](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Mister) drummer [Pat Mastelotto](http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Mastelotto) joining forces with and later replacing Bruford. This lineup included bassist [Trey Gunn](http://www.last.fm/music/Trey+Gunn) \- playing warr guitar and chapman stick - forming a “double trio” of two guitarists, two bassists and two drummers
