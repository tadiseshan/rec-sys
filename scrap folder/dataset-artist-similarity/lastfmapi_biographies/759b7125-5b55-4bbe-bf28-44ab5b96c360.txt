Jeff Hanson (1978 – June 5, 2009) was a [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), guitarist, and multi- instrumentalist whose voice was described in a 2005 Paste review as an “angelic falsetto, a cross between [Alison Krauss](http://www.last.fm/music/Alison+Krauss) and [Art Garfunkel](http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Garfunkel) that’s often (understandably) mistaken for a female contralto.”      Hanson was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He started learning guitar at four years old and by the age of 13 formed the emo/indie rock band [M.I.J.](http://www.last.fm/music/M.I.J.) Seven years later the band released a 7”, an EP and a full album on Caulfield Records.      He began a solo career in 2003 and was signed to Kill Rock Stars Records after sending in an unsolicited demo tape. He has since released three albums for the label, [Son](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Hanson/Son) in 2003 and [Jeff Hanson](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Hanson/Jeff+Hanson) in 2005. His third album for Kill Rock Stars titled [Madam Owl](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Hanson/Madam+Owl) was released on August 19 2008. Hanson’s solo albums were recorded at Presto! Recording Studios.      Since 1996 Hanson resided in Minneapolis-St. Paul.   Hanson was found dead on June 7, 2009, in his St. Paul apartment, which he had moved into a few days earlier. The cause was mixed drug toxicity.
