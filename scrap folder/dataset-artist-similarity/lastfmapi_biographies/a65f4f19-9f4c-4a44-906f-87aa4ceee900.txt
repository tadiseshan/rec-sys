Jacques Dutronc (born April 28, 1943 in Paris) is a French singer, composer, and actor. He is married to the singer [Françoise Hardy](http://www.last.fm/music/Fran%C3%A7oise+Hardy), as of March 30, 1974, with whom he had already had a son ([Thomas Dutronc](http://www.last.fm/music/Thomas+Dutronc), born 1973).      Between 1963 and 1964, Dutronc was the guitarist for a group called [El Toro Et Les Cyclones](http://www.last.fm/music/El+Toro+Et+Les+Cyclones) who recorded several EPs. During this time he could frequently be seen on stage at the Golf Drouot as backing guitarist for stars like [Eddy Mitchell](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+Mitchell). He then went and did his obligatory military service. After his return he landed a job as assistant at Vogue Records to Artistic Director Jacques Wolfsohn. In this capacity he arranged songs (there is no indication that he wrote the lyrics for any of these songs) for several lesser known artists like [Zou Zou](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Zou+Zou) and [Cleo](http://www.last.fm/music/Cleo). In 1966 (or maybe the end of 1965), he was teamed with writer [Jacques Lanzmann](http://www.last.fm/music/Jacques+Lanzmann), then director at Lui magazine, to create songs for artists who were arranged to be the next big thing. Benjamin was the first of these singers. But his first EP did horribly and he was unceremoniously booted from Vogue. One day after hearing the demos that Dutronc had made of a song, Wolfsohn declared that Jacques should do the record for release. “Et moi, et moi, et moi” was unleashed on the world in 1966 and overnight one of France’s biggest stars was born.   With Lanzmann in charge of the lyrics and Dutronc taking care of the music, the two created some of the most lasting songs in French pop history. There is almost no French person alive who does not know “Et moi, et moi, et moi”, “Les Playboys”, and “Le cactus”. Other great songs include “Mini, mini, mini”, “Le responsable”, “J’ai un tigre dans ma guitare”, and “L’opportuniste”. The music on most of these songs is a British garage sound and Dutronc has often been compared to [Ray Davies](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Davies) of [The Kinks](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks), and that comparison works musically as well. What really set Dutronc apart from the other singers of the time was his parody. His songs are not celebrating the “youth generation” but mocking it. Dutronc’s biggest hit was the beautiful “Il est cinq heures, Paris s’eveille”, with the classical flute player [Roger Bourdin](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Bourdin) (not as some had thought [Jean-Pierre Rampal](http://www.last.fm/music/Jean-Pierre+Rampal)) performing an essential part. In this song, Dutronc manages to paint a remarkably correct picture of the French capital in the early morning hours in the late 1960’s.
