Alex Parks (born Alexandra Rebecca Parks, 26 July 1984 in Mount Hawke, Cornwall) is an English singer-songwriter. She is best known for winning the BBC’s Fame Academy in 2003, for her singles, and for the albums, Introduction and Honesty.      The road to fame started for Parks when her father submitted an impromptu application to the BBC’s Fame Academy. She won the contest, and was given the opportunity to showcase her self-penned song “Maybe That’s What It Takes” to a public audience. The song was released on 17th November 2003 and peaked at number 3 in the UK Top 40 the following week. Her debut album Introduction was subsequently released and sold over 500,000 copies      Parks went quiet for a long time, amid rumours that she had quit the industry, but returned late in 2005 with an acclaimed album entitled “Honesty”. Unlike her previous album, everything on here consisted of her own work, something which she had been wanting ever since the Fame Academy days. Unfortunately, due to poor publicity and distribution issues this album did not reach as wide an audience as she may have liked.
