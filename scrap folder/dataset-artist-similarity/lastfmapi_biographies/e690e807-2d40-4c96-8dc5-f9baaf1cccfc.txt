[Richard Shindell](http://richardshindell.com) (born 1960, Lakehurst, New Jersey) is an American folk singer. He currently lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina with his wife and their children.      Shindell’s songwriting often involves storytelling from a first-person point of view: from an INS officer and illegal immigrant in “Fishing”, to a World War II soldier in “Sparrows Point”, to a Confederate drummerboy in “Arrowhead”, to an Argentine grandmother of Plaza de Mayo in “Abuelita”, to a power broker in “Confession”.      His first album was released in 1991. Shindell collaborated with [Dar Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Dar+Williams), and [Lucy Kaplansky](http://www.last.fm/music/Lucy+Kaplansky) to form the group [Cry Cry Cry](http://www.last.fm/music/Cry+Cry+Cry). On their eponymous 1998 album, [Cry Cry Cry](http://www.last.fm/music/Cry+Cry+Cry) covered an eclectic mix of songwriters, from the famous [R.E.M.](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M.) to the lesser known folk singer [James Keelaghan](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Keelaghan). The trio toured in support of their album, but later resumed their solo careers. They have not mentioned plans for future recordings, although Shindell and Kaplansky often appear on stage together. Shindell’s “The Ballad of Mary Magdalen” (as performed by [Cry Cry Cry](http://www.last.fm/music/Cry+Cry+Cry)) was used in the background during an ABC News _Nightline_ report on _The DaVinci Code_.      Shindell’s career received a boost in 1997 when [Joan Baez](http://www.last.fm/music/Joan+Baez) recorded three of his songs (“Fishing”, “Reunion Hill” and “Money for Floods”) for her album _Gone from Danger_, and invited him to join her 1997-98 tour.      In 2000, Shindell released _Somewhere Near Patterson_ (Signature Sounds), which quickly became his most successful release to date and established Shindell as one of the premier performing songwriters in popular music.      _Somewhere Near Patterson_ was followed by _Courier_, the live reprise of many of Shindell’s best-loved songs, in support of which he continues to tour.      Also in 2000, Shindell and his family moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he recorded his latest album, _Vuelta_, released in 2004. He joined up with an Argentine group, Puente Celeste, to create a unique sound for his newest work.      He released _Somewhere South of Delia_, a record of cover songs, March 2007.      **Discography:**   Sparrows Point (1992)   Blue Divide (1995)   Reunion Hill (1997)   Somewhere Near Patterson (2000)   Courier (2002)   Vuelta (2004)   Somewhere South of Delia (2007)
