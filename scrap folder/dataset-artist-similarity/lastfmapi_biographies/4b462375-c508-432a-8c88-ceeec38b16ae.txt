**Kim Wilde** is a [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) musician (born Kim Smith on 18 November 1960 in Hertfordshire, UK) that’s the daughter of [50s](http://www.last.fm/tag/50s) singer [Marty Wilde](http://www.last.fm/music/Marty+Wilde). She released her debut single, “[Kids in America](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/Kids+in+America)”, in 1981 at the age of 21. The song was written by both her father and her brother, Ricky. Ironically, Kim had never been to America at the time. “[Kids in America](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/Kids+in+America)” was a huge success in the [United Kingdom](http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom) and around the world, being a U.K. #2 hit. Her debut album, ‘_[Kim Wilde](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/Kim+Wilde)_’, (released on [RAK](http://www.last.fm/label/RAK) records) came out in July 1981 and stayed in the U.K. album charts for 14 weeks, peaking at number 3 and getting much acclaim. Two more hits from her debut were released: “[Chequered Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/Chequered+Love)” and “[Water on Glass](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/Water+on+Glass)”.       Picking up fame as a part of the popular ‘[new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave)’ movement, her second album, ‘_[Select](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/Select)_’, was released in May 1982. It contained the hits “[Cambodia](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/Cambodia)” and “[View from a Bridge](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/View+from+a+Bridge)”. Her third album (and last album with [RAK](http://www.last.fm/label/RAK)), was ‘_[Catch As Catch Can](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/Catch+As+Catch+Can)_’, which came out in November 1983. Sadly, it wasn’t much of a success, though tracks “[Love Blonde](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/Love+Blonde)” and “[Dancing in the Dark](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/Dancing+in+the+Dark)” from the album became minor hits.      When Kim signed with [MCA](http://www.last.fm/label/MCA) records in 1984, many doubting critics believed that her run of hits were over. Simply put, they were wrong. Kim’s first album with [MCA](http://www.last.fm/label/MCA), ‘_[Teases & Dares](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/Teases+&+Dares)’_, came out in November 1984. Though not a huge commercial success as an album, it earned praising critical reviews and much fan support while also including three hit singles. Popular tune “[Rage To Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/Rage+To+Love)” became Wilde’s first top 20 hit in two years.      In October 1986, Kim released a cover of [The Supremes](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Supremes) song [You Keep Me Hangin’ On](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/You+Keep+Me+Hangin%27+On) \- it was a huge hit, number 2 in the UK and in the singles chart for 14 weeks, even better the song got to number 1 in the USA. Kim was now a superstar around the globe. [Another Step](http://www.last
