Orchestre Baobab is a Senegalese band formed in 1970 in Dakar, Senegal as a multi-ethnic, multi-national club band.      Put together by saxophonist Baro N’Diaye, original members included singers [Balla Sidibe](http://www.last.fm/music/Balla+Sidibe), [Rudy Gomis](http://www.last.fm/music/Rudy+Gomis), and [Laye Mboup](http://www.last.fm/music/Laye+Mboup); guitarists Barthelemy Attisso and Latfi Ben Geloune; bassist Charlie N’Diaye; drummer Mountaga Koite; and saxophonist Issa Cissokho. [Ndiouga Dieng](http://www.last.fm/music/Ndiouga+Dieng) and [Medoune Diallo](http://www.last.fm/music/Medoune+Diallo) sometimes sat in with the band, and personnel changed frequently. Later, singer [Thione Seck](http://www.last.fm/music/Thione+Seck) and his younger brother [Mapenda Seck](http://www.last.fm/music/Mapenda+Seck) joined the band.      The group played an Afro-Cuban-Caribbean fusion. Unlike other Senegalese bands, they added Casamance harmonies and drumming (from southern Senegal), melodies from Togo and Morocco to the more common Wolof (from northern Senegal) influences. They recorded 20 vinyl albums between 1970 and 1985. In 1982, they released possibly their most famous album, Pirates Choice to much critical acclaim. This legendary session was re-released in a double CD format with 6 extra rare tracks, and the second disc is regarded as arguably better than the first.[citation needed] Competition from mbalax, a new sound in the mid 1980s, overwhelmed Orchestre Baobab. By 1987, the band had broken up.      Reissues of their old recordings in Europe led to the reformation of the band in 2001. Orchestre Baobab toured Europe and made a new recording with guest appearances by Cuban superstar Ibrahim Ferrer and Senegalese star Youssou N’dour.      In 2002 Orchestra Baobab released Specialist in All Styles which was produced by [Youssou N’Dour](http://www.last.fm/music/Youssou+N%27Dour).      Orchestra Baobab gained attention from American media in 2003 when musicians [Trey Anastasio](http://www.last.fm/music/Trey+Anastasio) and [Dave Matthews](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews) filmed a documentary named Trey and Dave go to Africa which aired on VH1. The two visit Senegal and perform with Orchestra Baobab during the program.      Orchestre Baobab performed at Live 8 in Johannesburg, a series of concerts to end poverty.      ————————————————————————————      Official World Circuit Biography   Senegal is a country with a rich musical heritage and one of the most vibrant pop music scenes on the African continent. Its music today is dominated by one main sound – the breathtaking rhythms of mbalax, the music of the Wolof people in the north of the country. But it was not always so. In the 1970s the style that filled Senegal’s airwaves was a fusion of Afro-Cuban elements with various local sounds drawn from Senegal’s diverse cultural traditions. And the undisputed masters of this fusion were the legendary Orchestra Baobab
