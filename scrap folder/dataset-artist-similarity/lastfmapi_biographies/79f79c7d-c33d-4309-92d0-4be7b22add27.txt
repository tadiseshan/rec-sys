**Lisa Scott-Lee** was a member of the UK highly successful [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) group [Steps](http://www.last.fm/music/Steps) during the late 1990s. Her three brothers formed [3SL](http://www.last.fm/music/3SL)      After failed attempts made by fellow Steps members [Faye Tozer](http://www.last.fm/music/Faye+Tozer) and [H and Claire](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/H+and+Claire) at post-Steps success, she launched her solo career with the catchy dance track [Lately](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Scott-Lee/_/Lately) which rose to number 6 in the UK single charts. This was quickly followed with [Too Far Gone](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Scott-Lee/_/Too+Far+Gone). Unfortunately, this failed to repeat her earlier success and stalled in the top 15.      It is reputed that due to disappointing single sales Lisa was dropped from Mercury Records, an act that halted recording of her debut album ‘Unleashed’.      Lisa returned with [Intenso Project](http://www.last.fm/music/Intenso+Project) for their dance track [Get It On](http://www.last.fm/music/Intenso+Project/_/Get+It+On) but despite a heavy promotional campaign, including numerous club performances, the single only reached number 23 of the UK singles chart.      In a determined attempt to revive her career (once again), Lisa signed a deal with MTV UK to launch a reality show called ‘Totally Scott Lee’; this time, everything was set for Lisa to continue her dream, but [Electric](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Scott-Lee/_/Electric) (the ‘make or break’ recording that was picked by Concept Records) didn’t ignite the UK charts leaving her stuck at number 13 chart position and vowing on television to end her music career.      However, in June 2007 she released [Never Or Now](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Scott-Lee/Never+Or+Now), a renamed version of her earlier shelved ‘Unleashed’ album (it even used the same artwork). With most of the tracks already leaked on the internet, the album was released in South Africa, Belgium and Holland in CD format and followed in the UK in DL format on June 18th.      [Never Or Now](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Scott-Lee/Never+Or+Now) is her first official album release and features twelve tracks including [Lately](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Scott-Lee/_/Lately), [Too Far Gone](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Scott-Lee/_/Too+Far+Gone), [Electric](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Scott-Lee/_/Electric) and [Boy on the Dancefloor](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Lisa+Scott- Lee/_/Boy+on+the+Dancefloor) (one of the Mercury recordings that Lisa kept for her, along with [I’ll Wait For You](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Scott- Lee/_/I%27ll+Wait+For+You) and the afforementioned tracks). The album also includes a recording of [Back In Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Scott- Lee/_/Back+In+Time) which she co-wrote with [Angel City](http://www.last.fm/music/Angel+City), a version of which appears on their 2005 album [Love Me Right](http://www.last
