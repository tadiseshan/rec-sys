Ricky Martin (born in San Juan, Puerto Rico on December 24, 1971 as Enrique Martin Morales), is a successful Puerto Rican pop singer who rose to fame, first as a member of the Latin boy band [Menudo](http://www.last.fm/music/Menudo), then as a solo artist since 1990. He has sold over 70 million records since the start of his career. He is considered a major star in the world of Latin Pop, and is considered to have opened the doors for some of his fellow Latin American singers like [Jennifer Lopez](http://www.last.fm/music/Jennifer+Lopez) and [Shakira](http://www.last.fm/music/Shakira).      Ricky Martin came out as gay on March 29, 2010 writing on his [website](http://www.rickymartinmusic.com/): “I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man. I am very blessed to be who I am.”      He attended Sagrado Corazón School and was an average student. He participated in school extra-curricular activities and sang in the school choir, where he began to realize that his talent captivated the audiences. Through the encouragement of his father, he began to take voice lessons, and auditioned for television advertising spots.      Martin first achieved worldwide success with his selection to replace Ricky Melendez in the Latin boy band Menudo from 1984 until 1989. His meteoric ascent to fame started in Menudo’s homebase, Caguas, site of his first concert. He signed with Sony in 1990.      After he left Menudo, he decided to continue his career. He moved to Mexico City where he started acting, first in theater in productions like Mamá ama el rock, and Los tenis Rojos with Angélica María and Angélica Vale. He starred in telenovelas such as Alcanzar una Estrella and performed in the music group Muñecos De Papel of that production. In 1994, he moved to Los Angeles, California. He received a role as bartender (Miguel Morez) in the American soap opera General Hospital.      Ricky established himself in Miami and connected with music creator Desmond Child, former Menudo band-mate Robi Draco Rosa and Puerto Rican agent Angelo Medina. With these 2 in tow, Ricky created hits like “[María](http://www.last.fm/music/Ricky+Martin/_/Mar%C3%ADa)”, “[The Cup of Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Ricky+Martin/_/The+Cup+of+Life)”, and “[Livin’ La Vida Loca](http://www.last.fm/music/Ricky+Martin/_/Livin%27+La+Vida+Loca)”. He sang “[The Cup of Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Ricky+Martin/_/The+Cup+of+Life)” during a World Cup broadcast that gave him worldwide exposure, but it was “Livin’ La Vida Loca” which became a massive crossover hit, made him popular around the world and propelled him into the covers of Tiger Beat and many other major magazines worldwide.      One of Ricky’s career high points was the recording of the Spanglish ballad “[Cuidado](http://www.last.fm/music/Ricky+Martin/_/Cuidado)” (“Be Careful”) with [Madonna](http://www.last.fm/music/Madonna) and William Orbit
