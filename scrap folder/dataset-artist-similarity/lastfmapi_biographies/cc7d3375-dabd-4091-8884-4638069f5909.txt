Kevin James LaBrie (born May 5, 1963) is a Canadian vocalist who is best known for being the lead singer in progressive metal band [Dream Theater](http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater). He has released several (progressive rock/metal style) solo albums as well as collaborating in various projects.      He was born in Penetenguishene, Ontario, Canada and started singing and playing drums at age 5. By his mid-teens, LaBrie was a member of several bands as a singer and/or drummer, and in 1981, at age 18, he moved to Toronto to further his musical pursuits. He currently still resides in Toronto, with his wife Karen, daughter Chloe, and son Chance.      Formerly of the band [Winter Rose](http://www.last.fm/music/Winter+Rose), he sent a sample to Dream Theater when they were auditioning for a new vocalist after firing their previous one, [Charlie Dominici](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Dominici). He subsequently got the job, debuting on Dream Theater’s seminal progressive metal album “[Images and Words](http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater/Images+and+Words)”, and reverted to using James as his first name to avoid confusion, as there already was a Kevin, as well as two Johns in the band at the time.      LaBrie has made many guest appearances with other artists, beginning with the song [Life In Still Water](http://www.last.fm/music/Fates+Warning/_/Life+In+Still+Water) on [Fates Warning](http://www.last.fm/music/Fates+Warning)’s album “[Parallels](http://www.last.fm/music/Fates+Warning/Parallels)”. In 1998, he performed on the [Explorers Club](http://www.last.fm/music/Explorers+Club) album “[Age of Impact](http://www.last.fm/music/Explorers+Club/Age+of+Impact)”.      He participated in [Ayreon](http://www.last.fm/music/Ayreon)’s rock opera “[The Human Equation](http://www.last.fm/music/Ayreon/The+Human+Equation)”, where he had one of the main parts as the character “Me”, released in 2004. James had earlier said that appearing on an Ayreon record would be a dream come true, and [Arjen Anthony Lucassen](http://www.last.fm/music/Arjen+Anthony+Lucassen) isn’t the type of person to spoil such a chance.      He also lent his voice to the conceptual progressive project [Frameshift](http://www.last.fm/music/Frameshift) from [Henning Pauly](http://www.last.fm/music/Henning+Pauly) on its first album “[Unweaving the Rainbow](http://www.last.fm/music/Frameshift/Unweaving+the+Rainbow)”, and to the track [Another Day Dies](http://www.last.fm/music/Redemption/_/Another+Day+Dies) on [Redemption](http://www.last.fm/music/Redemption)’s “[Snowfall On Judgement Day](http://www.last.fm/music/Redemption/Snowfall+On+Judgement+Day)”.      He released solo albums “[Keep It To Yourself](http://www.last.fm/music/Mullmuzzler/Keep+It+To+Yourself)” and “[Mullmuzzler 2](http://www.last.fm/music/Mullmuzzler/Mullmuzzler+2)” under the name [Mullmuzzler](http://www.last.fm/music/Mullmuzzler), featuring collaborations with [Matt Guillory](http://www.last
