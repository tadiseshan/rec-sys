Ben Kweller was born in San Francisco, CA in 1981. In 1982 his family relocated to Emory, TX where his father Howard Kweller became the town’s first doctor. In 1986, The Kwellers moved to a much larger city, Greenville, TX. Ben was exposed to music at a very early age. Howard taught Ben how to play the drums when he was 7 years old. For the next year, the father and son would jam together almost every night after Howard got home from work. With Howard singing and playing guitar and Ben keeping the beat, the duo would play songs by [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles), [The Hollies](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Hollies), [Jimi Hendrix](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix), and other artists of the 1960s. Howard is also a long-time friend of Nils Lofgren, the two went to high school together. When Ben turned 8, someone showed him how to play “Heart And Soul” on the piano. The youngster immediately began to create his own songs using the same chords. By the time he was 9 he had a dozen original compositions under his belt and entered a songwriting contest sponsored by Billboard magazine. Kweller won honorable mention.      In 1993, Kweller became friends with another young local musician, drummer John Kent, and the two formed the band [Radish](http://www.last.fm/music/Radish) with bassist Ryan Green. The trio played locally in and around Greenville, Texas and recorded two independent releases, ‘’Hello’’ (1994) and ‘’Dizzy’’ (1995), with Martin Baird at Verge Music Works recording studio in Dallas, Texas. Around the time of ‘’Dizzy’s’’ release, Ryan Green decided to leave the band and focus his attention on school. Lorin Hamilton filled in for a few months until Bryan Bradford AKA Bryan Blur joined on for most of the band’s career. Ben sent a copy of ‘’Dizzy’’ to Nils Lofgren. Nils was impressed with Radish and recommended them to Roger Greenawalt who was producing Lofgren’s album at the time, ‘’Damaged Goods’‘. Greenawalt took Radish into a studio where they recorded a demo tape which was subsequently shopped around to record labels nationwide, After an unexpected bidding war, Radish eventually signed to [Mercury](http://www.last.fm/label/Mercury) to release the album Restraining Bolt.      Radish made appearances on ‘’The Weird Al Show’‘, ‘’Late Night with Conan O’Brien” and ‘’Late Show with David Letterman’‘, but despite the much-hyped signing, the band failed to strike big success. Radish earned a large cult following in the United Kingdom with their top 40 hit “Little Pink Stars”. The band toured several times in Europe including opening slots for [Faith No More](http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+More) and Main Stage at Reading Festival ‘97. Radish released two singles. In 1998 Radish became a quartet featuring Joe Butcher ([Polyphonic Spree](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Polyphonic+Spree), [Ufofu](http://www.last.fm/music/Ufofu)) on lead guitar and Debbie Williams on bass
