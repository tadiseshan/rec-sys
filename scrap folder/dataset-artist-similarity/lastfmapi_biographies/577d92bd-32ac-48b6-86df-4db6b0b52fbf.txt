**Neil Sedaka** (born 13 March 1939 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American pop singer, pianist, and songwriter often associated with the Brill Building era of songwriting. He teamed up with [Howard Greenfield](http://www.last.fm/music/Howard+Greenfield) to write many major hit songs for himself and others.       Sedaka wrote his 1959 hit “Oh! Carol” about his then-girlfriend, Carol Klein, later to become [Carole King](http://www.last.fm/music/Carole+King). In 1963, King released a humorous answer entitled “Oh Neil”.      The [Laughter In the Rain Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=14612) says Sedaka’s hits dried up when The Beatles arrived, but then he teamed up with the lyricist Philip Cody and had a a number 1 hit with “Laughter In The Rain.” It re- ignited Sedaka’s career and he had 6 more Top-40 hits in America by 1977.      Sedaka’s voice is in the tenor range.
