Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (born March 28, 1986), who performs under the stage name Lady Gaga, is a singer, songwriter and musician from New York City, New York, United States.      Before Gaga adopted her stage name she was in a band called [Stefani Germanotta Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Stefani+Germanotta+Band). She released her first EP, “[Red and Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Red+and+Blue)”, in early 2006. The following year, music producer Rob Fusari dubbed her Lady Gaga, inspired by the [Queen](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen) song “Radio Gaga”. After this she recorded her first two songs as Lady Gaga ([Fever](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Fever) and [Wonderful](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Wonderful)) on Def Jam records, but was later let go.      She began her career as a songwriter for some of pop music’s biggest stars, including [Fergie](http://www.last.fm/music/Fergie), [Pussycat Dolls](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Pussycat+Dolls), [Britney Spears](http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears) and [New Kids on the Block](http://www.last.fm/music/New+Kids+on+the+Block), as well as American singer and producer [Akon](http://www.last.fm/music/Akon). After Akon recognized that Gaga also had vocal talent, he signed her to a joint deal with his own label, Kon Live Distribution, and then she started to work on her own new material for her debut album.      Gaga released “[The Fame](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/The+Fame)” in 2008, which she explained was “about how anyone can feel famous.” To date, the album has spawned the international number one hit singles “[Just Dance](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Just+Dance)” (nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 51st Grammy Awards) and “[Poker Face](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Poker+Face). [The Fame](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/The+Fame) then went Diamond in February 2010, selling over 12 million copies worldwide.      She then continued to release a new album 1 year later, “[The Fame Monster](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/The+Fame+Monster)”, which she wasn’t intending to make at first. She released “[Bad Romance](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Bad+Romance)” as the first single, and has been nominated for dozens of awards all over the world. After [The Fame Monster](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/The+Fame+Monster) was released she released two more singles “[Telephone](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Lady+Gaga/_/Telephone) (feat. [Beyoncé](http://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9))” and “[Alejandro](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Alejandro)”. She released “[Dance in the Dark](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Dance+in+the+Dark)” as a promotional single, but only released it in Australia, New Zealand and France. She undertook a large scale tour since “[The Fame Monster](http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/The+Fame+Monster)” was released, and referred to her shows as The Monster Ball
