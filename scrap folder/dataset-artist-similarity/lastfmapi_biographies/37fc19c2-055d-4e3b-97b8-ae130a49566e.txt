**Roddy Frame** (born January 29, 1964 in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, Scotland) is the founder of the 1980s Scottish indie band, [Aztec Camera](http://www.last.fm/music/Aztec+Camera). They released their first album, _[High Land, Hard Rain](http://www.last.fm/music/Aztec+Camera/High+Land,+Hard+Rain)_, when Frame was aged nineteen. It spawned the hit single [Oblivious](http://www.last.fm/music/Aztec+Camera/_/Oblivious), and Aztec Camera were recognised as one of the key acts on Glasgow’s [Postcard](http://www.last.fm/label/Postcard) record label, along with [Orange Juice](http://www.last.fm/music/Orange+Juice) and [Josef K](http://www.last.fm/music/Josef+K).      Frame later signed to [Rough Trade](http://www.last.fm/label/Rough+Trade). Aztec Camera’s biggest hit was 1987’s [Somewhere In My Heart](http://www.last.fm/music/Aztec+Camera/_/Somewhere+In+My+Heart), which reached number 3 in the UK singles chart and is still a staple of FM radio. Frame duetted with one of his musical heroes, [Mick Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Jones) of [The Clash](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Clash), on his 1990 single [Good Morning Britain](http://www.last.fm/music/Aztec+Camera/_/Good+Morning+Britain), which showcased an overtly political streak that sometimes featured in his work. He also recorded with the Japanese composer, [Ryuichi Sakamoto](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ryuichi+Sakamoto). Aztec Camera disbanded in 1996 after the release of their final album _[Frestonia](http://www.last.fm/music/Aztec+Camera/Frestonia)_.      Frame is now pursuing a solo career. His first solo album _[The North Star](http://www.last.fm/music/Roddy+Frame/The+North+Star)_ came out in 1998 and featured the single [Reason For Living](http://www.last.fm/music/Roddy+Frame/_/Reason+For+Living). There was a change of gear for 2002’s _[Surf](http://www.last.fm/music/Roddy+Frame/Surf)_, an album of acoustic songs that attracted widespread critical acclaim and was generally seen as a return to Frame’s best songwriting form. The track [Small World](http://www.last.fm/music/Roddy+Frame/_/Small+World) was used as the theme music to the BBC TV comedy series, _Early Doors_. Frame also made his first-ever appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in 2003. His most recent album _[Western Skies](http://www.last.fm/music/Roddy+Frame/Western+Skies)_ was released in May 2006.
