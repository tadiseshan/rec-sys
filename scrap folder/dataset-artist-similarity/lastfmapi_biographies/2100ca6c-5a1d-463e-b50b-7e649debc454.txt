Carlton George Douglas (born Oct 10th 1942) is a Jamaican-born, UK-resident singer. He is most famous for his song “[Kung Fu Fighting](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Douglas/_/Kung+Fu+Fighting)”, which hit number one on both the US Billboard Chart and the UK Singles Chart in 1974. In the wake of his #1, Douglas released other hit tracks including “[Dance the Kung Fu](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Douglas/_/Dance+the+Kung+Fu)” and “[Run Back](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Douglas/_/Run+Back)”, but the fame of his homage to martial arts films overshadowed the rest of the singer’s career.      Kung Fu Fighting has been the subject of numerous remixes,and Carl has made appearances on cover versions of the song. He now resides in Germany where he runs a publishing company that co-ordinates films, documentaries, and advertisements. As of 2005, his website said he is in the process of recording new material to release, but could not tour due to injuries sustained in an auto accident.      When Douglas first arrived in the U.K. around 1964, he hit the UK charts in 1964 with the single [Crazy Feeling](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Douglas/_/Crazy+Feeling) that went to #21. He also cut the Northern Soul classic, Serving A Sentence For Life. This is, indeed, the same Carl Douglas as the man who recorded [Kung Fu Fighting](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Douglas/_/Kung+Fu+Fighting).      <http://carl-douglas.com>
