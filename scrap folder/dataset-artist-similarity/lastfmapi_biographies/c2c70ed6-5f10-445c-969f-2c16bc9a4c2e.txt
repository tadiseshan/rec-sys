**[Sixpence None the Richer](http://www.sixpencehq.com/)**, often known as just “Sixpence”, is a [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop)/[rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band with roots in New Braunfels, Texas, United States, eventually settling in Nashville, Tennessee. Named after a passage in C. S. Lewis’ theological book [Mere Christianity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_Christianity), the group is best known for their critically acclaimed 1999 self-titled album, with ‘_[Sixpence None the Richer](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer/Sixpence+None+the+Richer)_’ showing their strong influence from both melodic [christian rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/christian%20rock) and [60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s) [british invasion](http://www.last.fm/tag/british%20invasion) music. Key members [Matt Slocum](http://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Slocum), a guitarist and songwriter, first met [Leigh Nash](http://www.last.fm/music/Leigh+Nash), a budding vocalist, at a church retreat in the early [90s](http://www.last.fm/tag/90s).      They recorded a demo (which now circulates as ‘_[The Original Demos](http://ww w.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer/The+Original+Demos)_’) and eventually an album, ‘_[The Fatherless and the Widow](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+N one+the+Richer/The+Fatherless+and+the+Widow)_’ for R.E.X. Records in 1993. The record featured Chris Dodds (of Slocum’s band [Love Coma](http://www.last.fm/music/Love+Coma)) on drums. Shortly after the release of the album, Slocum left Love Coma to pursue Sixpence full time. The band added Tess Wiley (guitar), J.J. Plasencio (bass) and Dale Baker (drums) for 1995’s ‘_[This Beautiful Mess](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Rich er/This+Beautiful+Mess)_’. Both albums, with featured the group’s early explicit Christian contemporary music sound, were produced by Armand John Petri.      In 1997, the group signed to [Steve Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Taylor)’s Squint Entertainment and prepared for the release of a self-titled album, with their work slowly began garnering attention from a wider audience. In 1999, “[Kiss Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer/_/Kiss+Me)” was released as a single, propelling Sixpence into the national [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) spotlight. This song was also notably used in the romantic comedy film ‘_[She’s All That](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She's_All_That)_’. The next year, the band recorded a cover of Britpop originators [The La’s](http://www.last.fm/music/The+La%27s) “[There She Goes](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer/_/There+She+Goes)”, which became their second hit single. This recording was added to Sixpence’s self-titled album, an album that received several releases, as a 13th track.      ‘_[Sixpence None the Richer](http://www.last.fm/music/Sixpence+None+the+Richer /Sixpence+None+the+Richer)_’, featuring a confessional, melodic sound reminiscent of contemporary [power pop](http://www.last
