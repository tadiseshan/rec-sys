He grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where his father Isaac Taylor was the dean of the University of North Carolina Medical School. His family summered on Martha’s Vineyard.      Taylor’s career began in the mid-1960s, but he found his audience in the early 1970s, singing sensitive and gentle acoustic songs. He was part of a wave of soft singer-songwriters of the time that also included [Carole King](http://www.last.fm/music/Carole+King), [Joni Mitchell](http://www.last.fm/music/Joni+Mitchell), [John Denver](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Denver), [Jackson Browne](http://www.last.fm/music/Jackson+Browne), and [Carly Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Carly+Simon) (whom he later married).      In March 2010 he commenced the Troubadour Reunion Tour with [Carole King](http://www.last.fm/music/Carole+King) and members of his original band, including Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar, and Danny Kortchmar. They played shows in Australia, New Zealand, Japan and North America, including the final event at Pittsburgh’s Mellon Arena. The tour was a major commercial success, and in some locations found Taylor playing arenas instead of his usual theatres or amphitheatres. With an average capacity of 95% for the shows, the tour raised millions for various charities of Taylor and King’s choice.      2\. **James Taylor** is a British acid jazz musician who has recorded several albums of minimalist acid jazz music as half of [Swayzak](http://www.last.fm/music/Swayzak).
