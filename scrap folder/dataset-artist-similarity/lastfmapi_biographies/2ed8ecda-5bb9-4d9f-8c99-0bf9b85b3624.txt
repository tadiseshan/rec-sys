Graham William Nash (OBE) (born 2 February 1942) is an English [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) known primarily for his light tenor vocals and songwriting contributions in pop group [The Hollies](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Hollies) and [folk- rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk-rock) band [Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Crosby,+Stills,+Nash+&+Young).      Nash was born in Blackpool, England, during World War II. His mother was evacuated from the Nashes’ hometown of Salford (now in Greater Manchester ), where Graham grew up. In the early 1960s he was a leading member of The Hollies, one of the UK’s most successful pop groups ever. Although recognised as a key member of the group, he seldom sang lead vocals, although he did write many of the band’s songs, most often in collaboration with Allan Clarke. Best known in the US for their 1965 hit “Bus Stop”, the Hollies also scored with “Look Through Any Window” in 1965, “Stop, Stop, Stop” in 1966, “Carrianne”, and “On a Carousel ” in 1967, among others. Nash was pivotal in the forging of a sound and lyrics showing an obvious hippie influence on The Hollies’ album Butterfly, a collection that brought differing opinions on the band’s musical direction to the fore.      In 1968, after a visit to the US during which he met David Crosby in Laurel Canyon and began recreational drug use, Nash left The Hollies at the height of their fame to form a new group with Crosby and Stephen Stills. A threesome at first, Crosby, Stills & Nash later became a foursome with Neil Young: Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY). With them, Nash went on to even greater worldwide success. Nash, nicknamed “Willy” by his band mates in CSNY, has been described as the glue that keeps their often fragile alliances together. A mark of this is the loyalty and support Nash showed to his best friend, Crosby, during Crosby’s well-documented period of drug addiction ending in the mid 1980s. Nash’s solo career has often been shelved in favour of reunions on stage and in the studio with either Crosby and Stills or Crosby, Stills and Young. His own solo work shows a love of melody and ballads. His solo recordings have experimented with jazz and electronic percussion but tend not to stray too far from a pop format with well-defined hook lines.      Nash became very politically active after moving to California to join with David Crosby and Stephen Stills, as reflected such in Nash songs as “Military Madness” and “Chicago (We Can Change the World)”. His song “Immigration Man”, Crosby and Nash’s biggest hit as a duo (see below), arose from a tiff he had with a US Customs official while trying to enter the country. Nash became an American citizen on August 14, 1978.      Starting in 1972, Nash teamed with Crosby, the two continuing as a successful recording and performing duo until the more or less permanent reformation with Stills for the CSN album of 1977
