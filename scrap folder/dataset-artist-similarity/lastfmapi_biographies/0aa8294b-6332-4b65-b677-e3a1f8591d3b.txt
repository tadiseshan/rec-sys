**Bonnie Tyler** (born Gaynor Hopkins on 8 June 1951- Skewen, Wales, United Kingdom) is a Welsh singer, songwriter and businesswoman.      Beginning as a local singer in Swansea, Tyler came to prominence with the release of her 1976 album [The World Starts Tonight](http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Tyler/The+World+Starts+Tonight) and its singles [Lost In France](http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Tyler/_/Lost+In+France) and [More Than A Lover](http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Tyler/_/More+Than+A+Lover). Her 1978 single [It’s a Heartache](http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Tyler/_/It%27s+a+Heartache) was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic, reaching number one in several European countries and breaking the American charts. After winning the 10th World Popular Song Festival with 1979 single [Sitting On The Edge Of The Ocean](http ://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Tyler/_/Sitting+On+The+Edge+Of+The+Ocean), Tyler converted from country music to rock music.

Tyler’s shift from rock to soft pop in the 1990s led to further success in continental Europe with singles [Bitterblue](http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Tyler/_/Bitterblue) and [Fools Lullaby](http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Tyler/_/Fools+Lullaby). With German producer [Dieter Bohlen](http://www.last.fm/music/Dieter+Bohlen), Tyler had continued success with three albums before releasing in the UK and America again, and her 1995 single [Making Love (Out Of Nothing At All)](http://www.la st.fm/music/Bonnie+Tyler/_/Making+Love+\(Out+Of+Nothing+At+All\)) narrowly missed the UK Top 40.
