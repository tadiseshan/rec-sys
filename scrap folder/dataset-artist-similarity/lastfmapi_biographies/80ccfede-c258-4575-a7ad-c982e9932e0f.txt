**Sheryl Suzanne Crow** (born February 11, 1962) is an [american](http://www.last.fm/tag/american) [blues rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock) singer, guitarist, bassist, pianist and songwriter. Her music blends [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country), [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop), [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk), and [blues rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock) into one mainstream sound, and she has won nine Grammy Awards. Crow is also a noted political activist.      Crow was born in Kennett, Missouri. Her parents were members of a local [big band](http://www.last.fm/tag/big%20band) in which her father, an attorney, played trumpet. The family was very musical and owned three pianos.      In school, she was active in choir, athletics, and school plays. Even at a young age she was a perfectionist who strived to please her parents. In high school she was a drum majorette, member of the Pep Club, the National Honor Society, Future Farmers of America, Freshman Maid, Senior Maid and Paperdoll Queen. When her prom date was later questioned about her fame he said that at the time he thought she “would be a doctor’s wife someday”. She graduated in 1984 from the University of Missouri where she majored in music education with a concentration in piano. Coincidentally, actor Brad Pitt and ABC-TV news anchor Elizabeth Vargas were also students at the University of Missouri at the same time Crow was studying there; however, it is unknown whether or not any of these three future celebrities actually knew each other while they were students.      Following college she became an elementary school music teacher in a suburb of St. Louis where she could be located closer to her fiance. Teaching during the day allowed her the opportunity to sing in bands on the weekends. Many people who knew her socially then, describe her as a nice, kind, elementary school teacher whose goal was settling down to raise children. At times, they acknowledge, she also struggled to get by on a teacher’s salary. Other than comments about wanting to go to California someday and “make it”, and her weekend band gigs, few during this period of her life saw the relentless determination that would someday carry her to multi-millionaire rock stardom. Or if they saw it, they didn’t realize they were witnessing a future rock star in training. This time in her life, in retrospect, might accurately be considered by those who knew her then as her “wilderness years.”      After a couple years of teaching and healing from a broken engagement, she was introduced to a local musician/producer. He had a thriving studio in the basement of his parent’s home and helped her by using her in advertising jingles. Her first jingle was a back-to-school spot for the St. Louis department store Famous-Barr. McDonald’s and Toyota commercial jingles soon followed. She was recently quoted in her 60 Minutes segment as saying she made $50,000 on her McDonald’s commercial alone
