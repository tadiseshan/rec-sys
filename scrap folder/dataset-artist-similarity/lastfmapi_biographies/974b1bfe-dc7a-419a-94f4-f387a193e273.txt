**Golden Smog** are a loosely connected group of musicians (arguably a [supergroup](http://www.last.fm/tag/supergroup)) comprising, at various times, members of [Soul Asylum](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum), [The Replacements](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Replacements), [Wilco](http://www.last.fm/music/Wilco), [The Jayhawks](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks), [Run Westy Run](http://www.last.fm/music/Run+Westy+Run), [The Honeydogs](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Honeydogs) and [Big Star](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Star).      The group took their name from the name of a Flintstones character, which, in turn, was a parody of singer [Mel Torme](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Mel+Torme)’s nickname; the Velvet Fog. The group first came together in the Minneapolis area in 1989 as a [country-rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/country-rock) reaction to the [punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk) and [hardcore](http://www.last.fm/tag/hardcore) music that dominated the Twin Cities’ musical scene at the time; eventually Golden Smog became something of a fixture at local clubs, where they would play a handful of shows annually. Golden Smog’s lineup has often changed, though [Run Westy Run](http://www.last.fm/music/Run+Westy+Run) guitarist [Kraig Jarret Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/Kraig+Jarret+Johnson) as well as guitarists [Dan Murphy](http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Murphy) ([Soul Asylum](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum)) and [Gary Louris](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Louris) ([The Jayhawks](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jayhawks)) were relative constants.      The definitive beginning of Golden Smog is hard to pinpoint given the mercurial nature of the band’s lineup. Some point back to a show in January of 1987 when a band billed as ‘The Take It To The Limit Band’ played an all [Eagles](http://www.last.fm/music/Eagles) cover show at the Uptown Bar in Minneapolis. This band consisted of [Dan Murphy](http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Murphy) and [Dave Pirner](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Pirner) (both of [Soul Asylum](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum)), [Jim Boquist](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Boquist) (later of [Son Volt](http://www.last.fm/music/Son+Volt)), and [Martin Zellar](http://www.last.fm/music/Martin+Zellar) ([Gear Daddies](http://www.last.fm/music/Gear+Daddies)). The show ended with a cover of then Bangles hit song Walk Like An Egyptian. This same band later played a [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones) themed show in 1989 under the name “Her Satanic Majesty’s Paycheck.”      Between these early covers shows, and Golden Smog’s first album, it is unclear what happened. It’s hard to claim that these early shows were by Golden Smog, but rather in hindsight they were played in the spirit of the early Golden Smog
