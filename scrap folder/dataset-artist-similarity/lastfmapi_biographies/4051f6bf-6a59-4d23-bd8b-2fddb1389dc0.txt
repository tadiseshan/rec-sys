There are multiple artists named Dennis Wilson:      1) American singer-songwriter, musician; founding member of [The Beach Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys).   2) British composer.      1) **Dennis Carl Wilson** (December 4, 1944 - December 28, 1983) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician, best known as one of the founding members of [The Beach Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys) alongside brothers [Brian](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson) and [Carl](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Wilson). The group’s drummer and occasional lead singer for much of his life, easily recognized by his bluesy and raspy voice, he later grew to become a gifted songwriter and multi- instrumentalist. His only solo album, _[Pacific Ocean Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Dennis+Wilson/Pacific+Ocean+Blue)_ (1977), is regarded as perhaps the finest Beach Boys solo recording.      Born in Hawthorne, California to Murry and Audree Wilson, Dennis Wilson was the Wilsons’ middle child, and a self-affirmed “black sheep.” A rebel from a young age, he was constantly at odds with his domineering father Murry, and would, as a consequence, be the one to suffer most from his abusive parenting techniques. As a teenager, Dennis became enamored with the burgeoning surfing scene; when the group that would become The Beach Boys was first formed, it was at Dennis’ suggestion that they decided to capitalize on what would in short time become a national phenomenon. Thus, the idyllic notion of sun, surf, and sand that has become emblematic of the state of California, can, by and large, be attributed to the group’s impending nationwide and international success, foreseen by Dennis.      As The Beach Boys grew in popularity, Dennis quickly became the sex symbol heartthrob of the group. Ironically, at the time Dennis had little faith in his own ability as a performer, and his earliest lead vocal, “[Little Girl (You’re My Miss America)](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/Little+Gir l+\(You%27re+My+Miss+America\))”, is noticeably shy and restrained compared to his later efforts. His vocal spots would remain few and far between for the first five years of the band’s existence; however, his importance to the group’s vocal blend, as well as his lively surf-inflected drumming, was a cornerstone of the group’s sound. By 1965, Dennis had seemingly overcome his shyness, resulting in a star turn as lead singer of the group’s hit single “[Do You Wanna Dance?](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/Do+You+Wanna+Dance%3F)”.      On the 1966 album _[Beach Boys’ Party!](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Beach+Boys%27+Party!)_, an acoustic recording session recorded as a stopgap measure in order to give Brian more time to complete his ambitious _[Pet Sounds](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Pet+Sounds)_ album, Dennis sang a cover version of [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles)’ “[You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away](http://www.last
