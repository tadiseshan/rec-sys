**Kevin Bloody Wilson** (born ‘’‘Dennis Bryant’‘’ on 13 February 1947 in Sydney, Australia) is a comedy singer/songwriter who uses a heavy Australian accent/style with great success. Without the aid of radio or Television coverage (due to the explicit, crude and sexual nature of his songs and general humour), he has built up a widespread cult following.      == Early career ==   Bryant was born in Sydney, New South Wales, although he identifies himself with Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, where he was an electrician in the gold mines.      In the 1970s Bryant fronted his own band called ‘Bryan Dennis and the Country Club’. He also used the name ‘Bryan Dennis’ when he hosted a country music show on 6KG in Kalgoorlie from 1973 to 1980, before he was thrown off air for playing the parody song, “I’m Heaving On A Jet Plane”.      He moved to Perth and began playing bawdy songs as a hobby, singing at pubs and Australian rules football clubs. In 1984 he put together a cassette of his songs called ‘[Your Average Australian Yobbo’‘, which he sold at gigs and by mail order. He managed to sell 22,000 copies of the cassette before it was eventually transferred to LP, where it went on to sell many thousands more.      He is notable as Perth’s most famous comedian.   His humor is regarded as political correctness/politically incorrect.   As one of Australia’s most successful comedians, he continues to tour and perform an average of 120 concerts world wide each year   2010 will see the release of his 15th album, EXCESS ALL AREAS   With no radio airplay and little television exposure, KEVIN BLOODY WILSON has sold more that 3.5 million albums      Wilson is married, and his wife Betty comes on tour with him   She can normally be seen selling merchandise - and has even appeared on guest vocals in a few of his songs, including “Dick’taphone”
