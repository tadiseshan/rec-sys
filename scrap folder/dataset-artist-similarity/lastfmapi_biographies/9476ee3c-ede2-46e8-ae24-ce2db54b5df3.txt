Francis Cabrel (born 23 November 1953 in Agen, France) is a French [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) and [guitarist](http://www.last.fm/tag/guitarist). Inspired heavily by [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan), he produced a significant number of albums falling mostly within the realm of [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk), with occasional forays into [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) or [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country). Several of his songs, such as “[L’Encre De Tes Yeux](http://www.last.fm/music/Francis+Cabrel/_/L%27Encre+De+Tes+Yeux)” and “[Petite Marie](http://www.last.fm/music/Francis+Cabrel/_/Petite+Marie)” have become enduring favourites in French music. His first hit was called “Je l’aime a mourir. Others, such as “[C’Etait L’Hiver](http://www.last.fm/music/Francis+Cabrel/_/C%27Etait+L%27Hiver)”, about the suicide of a young girl, have since been covered by other artists such as Canadian [Isabelle Boulay](http://www.last.fm/music/Isabelle+Boulay).
