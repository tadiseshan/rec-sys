Tony Matterhorn is a popular Jamaican dancehall deejay. Matterhorn’s worldwide popularity came in 2006, when he made a somewhat controversial song called “Dutty Wine” (Smash Riddim). The song is also a dance performed by young women, and many “dutty wining” competitions take place in Jamaica. The success of “Dutty Wine” has allowed Matterhorn’s latest single “Goodas Fi Dem” (Gully Slime Riddim) to get significant airplay in Jamaica, North America and parts of the UK.
