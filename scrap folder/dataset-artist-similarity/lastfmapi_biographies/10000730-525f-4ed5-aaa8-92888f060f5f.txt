**Bat for Lashes** is a pseudonym of Brighton, UK, based singer-songwriter / multi-instrumentalist / visual artist **[Natasha Khan](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Natasha+Khan)** (b. 25 Oct 1979, in Hertfordshire, England). She made her début with single **[The Wizard](http://www.last.fm/music/Bat+for+Lashes/_/The+Wizard)** (May 2006, She Bear/[Drowned in Sound](http://www.last.fm/label/Drowned+in+Sound)), following with albums **_[Fur and Gold](http://www.last.fm/music/Bat+for+Lashes/Fur+and+Gold)_** (Sept 2006, [Echo](http://www.last.fm/label/Echo)), **_[Two Suns](http://www.last.fm/music/Bat+for+Lashes/Two+Suns)_** (Apr 2009, Echo/[Parlophone](http://www.last.fm/label/Parlophone)), and her latest album is **_[The Haunted Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Bat+for+Lashes/The+Haunted+Man)_** (Oct 2012, Echo/Parlophone).      **Khan** graduated Brighton University, in music and visual arts, where her experimental multi-media / installation / animation / performance art’s influences spanned [tape loop](http://www.last.fm/tag/tape%20loop) / effects pioneer **[Steve Reich](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Reich)** and installation / performance artist **[Susan Hiller](http://www.last.fm/music/Susan+Hiller)**. Afterwards, when working as a nursery school teacher, she began writing for her début. _”Whenever I’m writing music it’s a very visual place in my mind,”_ she said, _”It has a location full of characters and colours and landscapes, so those two things really complement each other, and they help the other one to blossom and support the other. They are like brother and sister.”_ **Bat for Lashes** music has been likened to that of [Björk](http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk) (who herself attended **Khan**’s early gigs), **[PJ Harvey](http://www.last.fm/music/PJ+Harvey)**, **[Annie Lennox](http://www.last.fm/music/Annie+Lennox)**, **[Tori Amos](http://www.last.fm/music/Tori+Amos)** and **[Fiona Apple](http://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple)**.      “**The Wizard**” was primarily released on 7-inch from **Khan**’s own She Bear label and subsequently **_Fur and Gold_** on Echo. In 2007, she was honoured with a ASCAP Vanguard Award and selected to open the prestigious [ASCAP Presents… 2007, 14 Mar in Austin, TX, USA](http://www.last.fm/festival/3673145 +ASCAP+Presents%E2%80%A6+2007+w-+Bat+for+Lashes+-+White+Rabbits+-+more) (an industry showcase, within [SXSW 2007](/tag/SXSW2007)). Later, via a small [Manimal Vinyl](http://www.last.fm/label/Manimal+Vinyl) **_Fur and Gold_** pressing (May 2007), **Bat for Lashes** transferred to [Parlophone](http://www.last.fm/label/Parlophone). She appeared at [Glastonbury 2007](http://www.last.fm/festival/122007+Glastonbury+Festival+of+ Contemporary+Performing+Arts) (23 June).      In July 2007, **_Fur and Gold_**, [Joe’s Pub, NYC, on 1 May 2007](http://www.l ast.fm/event/3673171+Bat+for+Lashes+at+Joe%27s+Pub+on+1+May+2007) recordings and a [Plaid](http://www.last
