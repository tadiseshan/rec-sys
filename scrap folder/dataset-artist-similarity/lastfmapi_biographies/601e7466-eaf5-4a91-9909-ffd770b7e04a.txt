Arthur “Art” Blakey (October 11, 1919 – October 16, 1990), also known as Abdullah Ibn Buhaina, was an American jazz drummer and bandleader.      Along with [Kenny Clarke](http://www.last.fm/music/Kenny+Clarke) and [Max Roach](http://www.last.fm/music/Max+Roach), he was one of the inventors of the modern bebop style of drumming. He is known as a powerful musician and a vital groover; his brand of bluesy, funky hard bop was and continues to be profoundly influential on mainstream jazz. For more than 30 years his band [Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers](http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Blakey+&+The+Jazz+Messengers) included many young musicians who went on to become prominent names in jazz. The band’s legacy is thus not only known for the often exceptionally fine music it produced, but as a proving ground for several generations of jazz musicians; Blakey’s groups are matched only by those of [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis) in this regard. He was a member of the [Ahmadiyya Muslim Community](http://www.last.fm/music/Ahmadiyya+Muslim+Community).      Legendary jazz drummer Art Blakey (1919-1990) is best known for the band he led, known as [Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers](http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Blakey+&+The+Jazz+Messengers), which over the course of thirty years included some of the most prominent jazz musicians of the day — including [Clifford Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/Clifford+Brown), [Wayne Shorter](http://www.last.fm/music/Wayne+Shorter), [Lee Morgan](http://www.last.fm/music/Lee+Morgan), [Wynton Marsalis](http://www.last.fm/music/Wynton+Marsalis) and [Branford Marsalis](http://www.last.fm/music/Branford+Marsalis).      Blakey was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. By the time he was a teenager he was playing the piano full-time, leading a commercial band. Shortly afterwards, he taught himself to play the drums in the aggressive swing style of Chick Webb, Sid Catlett and Ray Bauduc. He joined Mary Lou Williams as a drummer for an engagement in New York in autumn 1942. He then toured with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra (1943–4). During his years with Billy Eckstine’s big band (1944–7) Blakey became associated with the modern-jazz movement, along with his fellow band members Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, Fats Navarro and others.[4]      In 1947 Blakey organized the Seventeen Messengers, a rehearsal band, and recorded with an octet called the Jazz Messengers. He claimed that he then travelled to Africa. Unfortunately, no documentation has been uncovered that supports this claim. In the early 1950s he performed and broadcast with such musicians as Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and Clifford Brown, and particularly with Horace Silver, his kindred musical spirit of this time. Blakey and Silver recorded together on several occasions, including the album A Night at Birdland (1954, BN), having formed in 1953 a cooperative group with Hank Mobley and Kenny Dorham, retaining the name Jazz Messengers
