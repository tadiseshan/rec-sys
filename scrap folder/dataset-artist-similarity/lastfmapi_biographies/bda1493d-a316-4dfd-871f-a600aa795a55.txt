[Tony Rebel](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Rebel) is cited by many as the first [rasta](http://www.last.fm/tag/rasta) “[singjay](http://www.last.fm/tag/singjay)” in [dancehall](http://www.last.fm/tag/dancehall) [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae) music, a style which blends singing with traditional deejaying over dancehall riddims (other singjays include [Pinchers](http://www.last.fm/music/Pinchers), [Anthony B](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B), and many newer artists).      Tony Rebel’s career began in the 1980’s, and was often seen performing with [Sugar Minott](http://www.last.fm/music/Sugar+Minott)’s [Youthman Promotion](http://www.last.fm/music/Youthman+Promotion) sound system. Rebel is responsible for introducing a young [Garnett Silk](http://www.last.fm/music/Garnett+Silk) (then known as Bimbo or Little Bimbo) to the sound. The two were closely linked until Silk’s untimely death in 1994.      Tony Rebel’s career was at its peak in the early 1990’s, with such hit records as “Fresh Vegetable”, “Sweet Jamaica” and the duet with Garnett Silk “Christian Soldiers”. He remained prominent in the late 90’s with the smash hit “If Jah” on the La La Bella riddim.      Tony Rebel still performs occasionally, but has focused most of his energy into the career of protege [Queen Ifrica](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen+Ifrica) and his immensely popular, annual reggae festival in St. Elizabeth, Jamaica entitled Rebel Salute.
