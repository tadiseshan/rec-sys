Fatman Scoop born Isaac Freeman III is a New York City hip hop hype man and radio personality. He is best known for the track “Be Faithful” with the Crooklyn Clan which went to number one in the UK and Ireland in late 2003 and top 5 in Australia. The song has been a favourite in clubs around the world for years but it took two years to clear the samples from Jay-Z, Black Sheep, Queen Pen, The Beatnuts and Faith Evans. The track takes its name from the sample of Evans singing. The follow up “It Takes Scoop” reached the top 10 in the UK, the top 20 in Ireland and the top 40 in Australia in 2004. In 2005, Fatman Scoop was featured on two hit songs, Mariah Carey’s “It’s Like That” and Missy Elliott’s “Lose Control”. Scoop also hosts his own show on popular New York City radio station WQHT (FM)Hot 97.
