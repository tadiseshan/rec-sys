Paul Albert Anka (born July 30, 1941, in Ottawa, Ontario, [Canada](http://www.last.fm/place/Canada)) is a Lebanese-Canadian [singer](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer) and [songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/songwriter).      He began singing as a child, first starting in the St Elijah Syrian Orthodox Church choir in Ottawa. As a student at Ottawa’s Fisher Park High School he was part of a trio called the [Bobby Soxers](http://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Soxers).      Encouraged by his parents, at age 14 he recorded his first single, _[I Confess](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Anka/_/I+Confess)_. In 1957 he went to New York City where he auditioned for ABC, singing a lovestruck verse he had written to a former babysitter, Diana Ayoub. The song, _[Diana](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Anka/_/Diana)_, brought Anka instant stardom as it rocketed to number one on the charts. _Diana_ is one of the best selling 45s in music history. He followed up with four songs that made it into the Top 20 in 1958, making him one of the biggest [teen idol](http://www.last.fm/tag/teen%20idol)s of the time. He toured Britain and then, with [Buddy Holly](http://www.last.fm/music/Buddy+Holly), toured Australia.      His talent went beyond singing, writing Buddy Holly’s giant hit, _[It Doesn’t Matter Anymore](http://www.last.fm/music/Buddy+Holly/_/It+Doesn%27t+Matter+Anymore)_, the theme for Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show, Tom Jones’ biggest hit record, _[She’s A Lady](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Jones/_/She%27s+A+Lady)_, and the English lyrics for _[My Way](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra/_/My+Way)_, [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra)’s signature song and sung by many well known artists, including [Greta Keller](http://www.last.fm/music/Greta+Keller), for whom the words were very fitting.      In the 19[60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s), Anka would begin acting in motion pictures as well as writing songs for them, most notably the theme for the hit movie The Longest Day. From his movie work, he wrote and recorded his monster hit, _[Lonely Boy](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Anka/_/Lonely+Boy)_. He then went on to become one of the first pop singers to perform at the Las Vegas casinos.      After more than ten years without a hit record, in 1974 he teamed up with [Odia Coates](http://www.last.fm/music/Odia+Coates) to record the number 1 hit, _[Having My Baby](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Anka/_/Having+My+Baby)_. They would record two more duets that both made it into the Top 10. In 1975, he wrote a jingle for Kodak called The Times of Your Life. The jingle became so popular, he recorded it as a full song, _[The Times Of Your Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Anka/_/The+Times+Of+Your+Life)_, and it became a hit a year later.      By the 19[70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s), Anka’s career centered around adult contemporary and big-band standards, played regularly in Las Vegas. On September 6, 1990, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States
