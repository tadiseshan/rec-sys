**Minnie Riperton** (Nov 8, 1947 - Jul 12, 1979) was an American singer who is best remembered for her 1974 hit ballad, [Lovin’ You](http://www.last.fm/music/Minnie+Riperton/_/Lovin%27+You).      The tragic 1979 death of 31-year-old Riperton silenced one of soul music’s most unique and unforgettable voices - blessed with an angelic five-octave vocal range, she scored her greatest commercial success with the chart-topping pop ballad, “Lovin’ You”. Riperton was born in Chicago on November 8, 1947. As a young girl, she studied music, drama, and dance at the city’s Lincoln Center and later contemplated a career in opera. Her pop career began in 1963 when she joined the local girl group called [The Gems](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Gems) (not to be confused with the 60s New York-based girl group [Gems](http://www.last.fm/music/Gems), led by Louise Bethune), who were also known at times as [The Starlets](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Starlets) (1963-1966), signing to the famed [Chess](http://www.last.fm/label/Chess) label to release a handful of singles as well as lend backing vocals to acts including [Fontella Bass](http://www.last.fm/music/Fontella+Bass), [The Dells](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Dells), and [Etta James](http://www.last.fm/music/Etta+James). After graduating from high school, Riperton went to work at Chess as a receptionist. A year before The Gems’ dissolution in 1967, she also signed with the label as a solo act, releasing a single, [Lonely Girl](http://www.last.fm/music/Andrea+Davis/_/Lonely+Girl), under the alias [Andrea Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Andrea+Davis) (a pseudonym she used in honor of [Billy Davis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Davis_\(songwriter\)), her mentor at Chess who wrote the song for her).      In 1967, Riperton was installed as the lead vocalist of the psychedelic soul band [Rotary Connection](http://www.last.fm/music/Rotary+Connection), which debuted that year with a self-titled LP on Cadet Concepts. The singles “Amen” and “Lady Jane” found a home on underground FM radio, but the group failed to make much of an impression on mainstream outlets. While still a Connection member, Riperton mounted a solo career. Teaming up with producer/arranger Charles Stepney and her husband/composer Richard Rudolph, she issued her brilliant 1970 debut, _[Come To My Garden](http://www.last.fm/music/Minnie+Riperton/Come+To+My+Garden)_, but again commercial success eluded her. After Rotary Connection dissolved in the wake of 1971’s _[Hey Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Rotary+Connection/Hey+Love)_, she and Rudolph took a two-year sabbatical in Florida before relocating to Los Angeles, where she sang on [Stevie Wonder](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder)’s _[Fulfillingness’ First Finale](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder/Fulfill ingness%27+First+Finale)_ and toured as a member of his backing unit Wonderlove.      Wonder agreed to co-produce Riperton’s 1974 album _[Perfect Angel](http://www.last
