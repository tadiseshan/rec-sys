**Peter Joseph Andrew Hammill** (born 5 November 1948, in Ealing, West London, England) is a [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), and a founding member of [progressive rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20rock) band [Van der Graaf Generator](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+der+Graaf+Generator). Most noted for his vocal abilities, his main instruments are guitar and piano. He also acts as a record producer for his own recordings, and occasionally for other artists.      With an extensive solo career spanning dozens of albums, Peter Hammill is certainly more than just the front-man and leader of Van Der Graaf Generator (VdGG). His literate, soul-examining lyrics and his often-anguished vocal delivery make his music perhaps an acquired taste, but his uncompromising artistic vision has shone since his first release, _[Fool’s Mate](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Hammill/Fool%27s+Mate)_, back in 1971.      Stylistically, he has forged his own path, touching on [progressive rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20rock), [punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk) (before it was even called that), [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) experimentation, intimate [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) settings, and even [opera](http://www.last.fm/tag/opera)/musical theatre (with his adaptation of Poe’s _[The Fall of the House of Usher](http://www.last.fm/music /Peter+Hammill/The+Fall+of+the+House+of+Usher)_).      Hammill’s solo career has coexisted with VdGG’s activities. The band was offered a contract by [Mercury](http://www.last.fm/label/Mercury) Records in 1968, that only Hammill signed. When VdGG broke up in 1969 he wanted to record his first solo-album. In the summer of 1969 Hammill had a residency at The Lyceum and played weekly solo-concerts there. Eventually the intended solo- album was released under the VdGG-banner as their first album (_[The Aerosol Grey Machine](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+der+Graaf+Generator/The+Aerosol+Gre y+Machine)_). Hammill’s first official solo-album was _Fool’s Mate_ (1971), containing songs from the early (1967/68) VdGG-days.      When VdGG broke up again in August 1972, Hammill resumed his solo-career. Songs that were intended for VdGG, now ended up on his solo-albums, notably “[(In The) Black Room (Including ‘The Tower’)](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+ Hammill/_/\(In+The\)+Black+Room+\(Including+%27The+Tower%27\))” (on _[Chameleon In The Shadow Of The Night](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Hammill /Chameleon+In+The+Shadow+Of+The+Night)_) and “[A Louse Is Not a Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Hammill/_/A+Louse+Is+Not+a+Home)” (on _[The Silent Corner And The Empty Stage](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Hammil l/The+Silent+Corner+And+The+Empty+Stage)_)
