**Paul “Sage” Francis** (born November 18, 1976 in [Miami](http://www.last.fm/tag/miami), [Florida](http://www.last.fm/tag/florida)) is a [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) artist based in [Providence](http://www.last.fm/tag/providence), [Rhode Island](http://www.last.fm/tag/rhode%20island).       Noted for his intense flow and sharp wit, Francis has won acclaim both as a freestyle battler and as an unapologetic, intellectual lyricist. Francis uses a broad emotional palette to address a wide range of personal, cultural, and [political](http://www.last.fm/tag/political) issues. His unconventional style and persona have given him crossover appeal, but at the same time alienated some hip-hop listeners.      Prior to embarking on a full-time career as an MC, Francis displayed his skills in [slam poetry](http://www.last.fm/tag/slam%20poetry). During the late 19[90s](http://www.last.fm/tag/90s), he recorded his first demo tape (1996), fronted the now defunct Providence hip-hop band [Art Official Intelligence](http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Official+Intelligence), and hosted a weekly slot on [independent](http://www.last.fm/tag/independent) radio station WRIU (the “True School Session”). He also formed the [Non- Prophets](http://www.last.fm/music/Non-Prophets) and released a 12” (_Drop Bass/Bounce/I Keep Calling_, Emerge Records, 1999), following up in 2003 with their first full-length offering, _[Hope](http://www.last.fm/music/Non- Prophets/Hope)_. Francis is a contemporary of [underground hip- hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/underground%20hip-hop) artists such as [SLuG](http://www.last.fm/music/SLuG), [Eyedea](http://www.last.fm/music/Eyedea), [Sole](http://www.last.fm/music/Sole) and the [anticon.](http://www.anticon.com/) collective. He is also loosely affiliated with the vague underground hip-hop super-group [The Orphanage](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Orphanage).      As a solo performer, Francis won the MC battle at the 2000 [Scribble Jam](http://www.scribblemagazine.com/news.html), and in 2001 he came close to repeating as champion (semi-finalist) while performing as his “[metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/metal)” alter ego, “[Xaul Zan](http://www.last.fm/music/Xaul+Zan)”. Francis released his first proper solo album, _[Personal Journals](http://www.last.fm/music/Sage+Francis/Personal+Journals)_, on Anticon. in 2002. He toured with a live band on the Live Band Dead Poet Tour to support it. Francis subsequently became the first hip-hop artist to sign with [punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk) label [Epitaph](http://www.epitaph.com/), agreeing to a three-album deal. His first album for Epitaph, _[A Healthy Distrust](http://www.last.fm/music/Sage+Francis/A+Healthy+Distrust)_, was released in early 2005 and was followed up with _Human the Death Dance_ in 2007.      One of Francis’ best-known tracks is “Makeshift Patriot”, a commentary on the [American](http://www.last
