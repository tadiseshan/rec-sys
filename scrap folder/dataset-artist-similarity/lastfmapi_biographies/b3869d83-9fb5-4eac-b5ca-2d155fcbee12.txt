He’s garnered a rep for his signature, rapid-fire delivery, yet he’s considerably more than just a fast rapper. He sings and produces-though not quite a singer nor [producer](http://www.last.fm/tag/producer)-and is the founder of [QN5 Music](http://www.qn5.com/), though you wouldn’t just call him a label head. He’s the artist you can’t quite categorize.      Perhaps most impressive is that he does all of these things, and well. With a background as colorful as his talents, **Tonedeff** grew up in Chicago, IL, before moving to Miami, FL, for the remainder of his adolescence. While it was in [Miami](http://www.last.fm/tag/miami) that he began recording and performing, it wasn’t until relocating to [Queens](http://www.last.fm/tag/queens), [NY](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20york) at 21 that the well-traveled emcee really began making noise. He won a string of battles, including the Braggin’ Rites MC Battle and NYC’s notorious Da Cypha battles, to name a few. At the same time, he built a name for himself by opening for esteemed acts such as [Common](http://www.last.fm/music/Common), [Royce Da 5’9](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Royce+Da+5%279), [Beatnuts](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Beatnuts), [Brand Nubian](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian) and [Rahzel](http://www.last.fm/music/Rahzel).      Where most up-and-comers hit a stalemate, however, Tonedeff had only just begun. After forming the [independent](http://www.last.fm/tag/independent) label QN5 Music in 2000, he released a series of work including the enhanced _Hyphen EP_, _Happy F*ck You Songs_ with [Extended F@mm](http://www.last.fm/music/Extended+F@mm), the “Clear ‘Em Out” 12” single with [KRS-One](http://www.last.fm/music/KRS-One), and countless guest spots for artists such as [Masta Ace](http://www.last.fm/music/Masta+Ace), [Dj JS-1](http://www.last.fm/music/Dj+JS-1) and [CunninLynguists](http://www.last.fm/music/CunninLynguists). 2003 saw him grace the pages of The Source Magazine and the MTV airwaves in a commercial for Hip Hop Week.      April 2005 marks the release of _Archetype_, his long-anticipated debut LP. A culmination of his artistic abilities, _Archetype_ displays the incontestable versatility and raw talent that sets him apart from the rest. Comprising the spine-tingling harmonies of the intro; the relentless, rapid-fire punchlines of “Let’s Go” and “Issawn”; the unabashed wit and comedy of “Disappointed” and “Pervert”; and the breathtaking beauty of the true story “Porcelain”; Tonedeff shatters the mold of conventional hip-hop, bringing it to levels that others only speak of. Influenced by a diverse range of artists - Common, [Fresh Prince](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Fresh+Prince), [Enya](http://www.last.fm/music/Enya), [Tori Amos](http://www.last.fm/music/Tori+Amos) and [Bjork](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bjork), for example-his own style is reflective of such, a melting pot of styles and sounds
