Grover Washington, Jr. (December 12, 1943 - December 17, 1999) has been considered by many to be the founding father of [smooth jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/smooth%20jazz) and a master of the [jazz funk](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20funk) genre, working as a prominent songwriter and talented saxophonist. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Washington made some of the genre’s most memorable hits. These include “[Mister Magic](http://www.last.fm/music/Grover+Washington,+Jr./_/Mister+Magic)”, [Black Frost](http://www.last.fm/music/Grover+Washington,+Jr./_/Black+Frost)”, and “[The Best Is Yet To Come](http://www.last.fm/music/Grover+Washington,+Jr. /_/The+Best+Is+Yet+To+Come)” (with [Patti LaBelle](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+LaBelle) on guest vocals).      In addition, he performed very frequently with other artists, including [Bill Withers](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers) on “[Just The Two Of Us](http://www.last.fm/music/Grover+Washington,+Jr./_/Just+The+Two+Of+Us)” (a song still in regular rotation on radio today) and [Phyllis Hyman](http://www.last.fm/music/Phyllis+Hyman) on “[Sacred Kind Of Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Grover+Washington,+Jr./_/Sacred+Kind+Of+Love)”. He is also remembered for his take on a [Dave Brubeck](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Brubeck) classic, called “[Take Another Five](http://www.last.fm/music/Grover+Washington,+Jr./_/Take+Another+Five)”, as well as for his hit “[Soulful Strut](http://www.last.fm/music/Grover+Washington,+Jr./_/Soulful+Strut)”. His work continues to inspire jazz artists even today.      Washington was born in Buffalo, New York, 12 December 1943. Regarded as one of the revolutionaries in [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) music and is considered one of the greatest saxophone players in [modern jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/modern%20jazz) history. He led many others to follow in his footsteps.      Washington’s history was music-filled. His mother was a church chorister, and his father was a collector of old [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) 78s and a saxophonist as well, so music was everywhere in the home. He grew up with the great jazz men and big band leaders like [Benny Goodman](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Goodman), [Fletcher Henderson](http://www.last.fm/music/Fletcher+Henderson), and others like them. At the age of 8, with the desire for him to be more than he could be, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone. He practiced and sneaked into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians.      He left Buffalo and played with a mid-west group called the [Four Clefs](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Four+Clefs). He was drafted into the US Army shortly thereafter, but this was to be to his advantage, as he met drummer [Billy Cobham](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Cobham). Cobham, a mainstay in New York City, introduced Washington to many New York musicians. After leaving the Army, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967
