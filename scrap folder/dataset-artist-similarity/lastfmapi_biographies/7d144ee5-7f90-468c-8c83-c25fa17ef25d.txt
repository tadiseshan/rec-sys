Nationalteatern. Swedish rock group from the 1970s with leftist political texts. Originally a traveling theater ensemble with many members, most notable [Ulf Dageby](http://www.last.fm/music/Ulf+Dageby), [Anders Melander](http://www.last.fm/music/Anders+Melander), [Totta Näslund](http://www.last.fm/music/Totta+N%C3%A4slund), [Nikke Ström](http://www.last.fm/music/Nikke+Str%C3%B6m), [Hans Mosesson](http://www.last.fm/music/Hans+Mosesson) and [Pale Olofsson](http://www.last.fm/music/Pale+Olofsson).      On Barn av vår tid, (Children of our time), from 1978, the first album featuring Totta Näslund, and later Rövarkungens ö (The Island of the Bandit King), from 1980, the group moved away from the theatrical work and concentrated on the music, calling themselves a Rock Orchestra.      The group was dissolved soon after, but the new millennium has seen several reunions of Nationalteatern, touring all over Sweden. But no new songs or albums have been recorded.      Totta Näslund died in 2005, though the band still gives concerts from time to time.
