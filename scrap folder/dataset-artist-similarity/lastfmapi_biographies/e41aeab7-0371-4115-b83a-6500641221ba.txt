Chantal Goya (born Chantal de Guerre June 10, 1946 in Saigon (French Indochina)), is a French singer and actress.      Chantal Goya started her career as a yé-yé girl, singing a catchy mid-’60s hybrid of girl-group pop and French chanson. She also enjoyed a career as a French New Wave actress; she had a starring role as Madeleine in the 1966 Jean-Luc Godard film Masculin, féminin and in Love is gay, love is sad (Jean- Daniel Pollet).      Since 1975, she became mostly known as a singer for children. Together with her husband, songwriter and composer Jean-Jacques Debout, and with a talented team of designers and costume people, she does shows for and with children. The main themes are dreams and traveling. Her usual character is Marie-Rose, a mix between a maid and an older sister (reminiscent of Julie Andrews in both The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins). Chantal Goya sold 39 millions of records and remains the most popular singer for children in the world.
