Vocalist/bass guitarist/songwriter Glenn Hughes is a true original. No other rock musician has carved such a distinctive style blending the finest elements of hard rock, soul and funk. That astonishing voice is Hughes’ calling card. He’s known as a singer’s singer: in fact, Stevie Wonder once called Hughes his favorite white singer.      Hughes, a native of Cannock, England, absorbed all kinds of influences, including early British hard rock, the Beatles and, most importantly, American soul and R&B. The sleek Motown sound from Detroit and the gritty Stax/Volt sound from Memphis left their mark on him.      The first important band Hughes was a member of that achieved notable success was [Trapeze](http://www.last.fm/music/Trapeze), while in 1973 he joined one of the most popular bands in the world, [Deep Purple](http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple). The trailblazing hard-rock legends had just weathered the departure of vocalist [Ian Gillan](http://www.last.fm/music/Ian+Gillan) and bass guitarist [Roger Glover](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Glover), but guitarist [Ritchie Blackmore](http://www.last.fm/music/Ritchie+Blackmore), keyboardist [Jon Lord](http://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Lord) and drummer [Ian Paice](http://www.last.fm/music/Ian+Paice) continued with the addition of Hughes and [David Coverdale](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Coverdale). Any skepticism was squelched with the 1974 release of Burn. This stunning album rejuvenated the band and stands tall among Deep Purple classics.      In the halcyon days, Purple headlined at the famous California Jam in 1974 in front of quarter of a million people. World tours via Purple’s own jet plane, ‘The Starship’ and two more studio albums later, (the Hughes influenced Stormbringer and Come Taste the Band), Deep Purple finally split in 1976.      Now living in Los Angeles, Glenn’s first solo album Play Me Out was released in 1977. He joined former [Pat Travers](http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Travers) guitarist [Pat Thrall](http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Thrall) to form [Hughes/Thrall](http://www.last.fm/music/Hughes%2FThrall), which released an acclaimed self-titled album in 1982. Throughout the ’80s and ’90s, Hughes made countless guest appearances (both credited and un-credited) as a vocalist, bass guitarist or songwriter on other artists’ albums, in particular he appeared on the vastly underrated Seventh Star, was officially credited as ‘[Black Sabbath](http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath) Featuring [Tony Iommi](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Iommi)’. Hughes and Iommi remained friends and in the past few years they have released one brand new studio album together
