Besides these two songs, five more of Montgomery’s singles have reached the top of the country charts: “I Love the Way You Love Me”, “Be My Baby Tonight”, “If You’ve Got Love”, “I Can Love You Like That”, and “The Little Girl”, while thirteen more have reached Top Ten. Montgomery’s recordings of “I Swear” and “I Can Love You Like That” were both released concurrently with R&B versions by the group All-4-One. Montgomery has also released eleven studio albums, counting a Christmas album.      John Michael joined the family band (which also included his brother, Eddie Montgomery, who would later join Troy Gentry in the duo Montgomery Gentry) as guitarist before taking the lead singing role when his parents divorced. Afterwards, he made a frugal living on the local honky-tonk scene as a solo artist playing what he referred to as “working man’s country.” Eventually, Atlantic Records signed him.
