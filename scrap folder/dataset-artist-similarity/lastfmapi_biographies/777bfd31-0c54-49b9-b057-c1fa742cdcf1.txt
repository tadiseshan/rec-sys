Paolo Conte (born 6 January 1937 in Asti, Piedmont, Italy) is a craggy-voiced italian singer, pianist and composer. He both writes and performs his own material and his grainy, resonant voice redolent of Francophone singers like [Jacques Brel](http://www.last.fm/music/Jacques+Brel) adds a certain charm to his wistful, sometimes melancholic lyrics.      His performing career began as a vibraphone player in local and touring bands. He began songwriting with his brother Giorgio Conte early on and eventually began writing songs of his own. As a poet, painter and lawyer as well as a musician, he first earned attention during the late ’60s and early ’70s as the creative force behind hits from [Adriano Celentano](http://www.last.fm/music/Adriano+Celentano) and [Patty Pravo](http://www.last.fm/music/Patty+Pravo). Conte began his solo career with a 1974 self-titled LP, with subsequent efforts like 1987’s Aguaplano and 1990’s Parole D’Amore Scritte a Macchina enjoying considerable success throughout Europe. 1998’s Paolo Conte, a greatest-hits collection, was his first U.S. release. His compilation album is titled [The Best Of Paolo Conte]( http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Paulo+Conte/The+Best+Of+Paolo+Conte).      Some of his hits were used in many movies, for example “[COME DI](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Paulo+Conte/_/COME+DI)” (1999), “[Via Con Me](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Paulo+Conte/_/Via+Con+Me)” in French Kiss (1995), Welcome to Collinwood (2002) , “[Sparring Partner](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Paulo+Conte/_/Sparring+Partner)” in 5x2 (2004), “Chiamami Adesso” in The Lake House (2006), and the “Fritz” Coca Cola commercial that was widely shown in US movie theaters in early 2006. French humourist Pierre Desproges used both in his Chroniques de la haine ordinaire. The lyrics of “Insieme a te non ci sto più” was performed by Caterina Caselli in the Italian 2001 hit-at-Cannes La Stanza del Figlio.      Paolo Conte was a lawyer for years and has only retired recently.
