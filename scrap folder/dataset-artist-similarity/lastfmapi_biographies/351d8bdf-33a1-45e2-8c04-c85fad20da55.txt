Sarah Lois Vaughan (nicknamed “Sassy” and “The Divine One”) (March 27, 1924, Newark, New Jersey – April 3, 1990, Los Angeles, California) was an American [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) [singer](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer), described as “possessor of one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century”. Jazz critic Leonard Feather called her “the most important singer to emerge from the [bop](http://www.last.fm/tag/bop) era.” [Ella Fitzgerald](http://www.last.fm/music/Ella+Fitzgerald) called her the world’s “greatest singing talent.” When introduced in her two-part interview of 1980 on The Dick Cavett Show, Cavett quipped (in a takeoff on a well known Sarah Lee product advertising slogan of the time), “Everybody doesn’t like something, but nobody doesn’t like Sarah Vaughn.” During the course of a career that spanned nearly fifty years, she was the singer’s singer, influencing everyone from [Mel Torme](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Mel+Torme) to [Anita Baker](http://www.last.fm/music/Anita+Baker). She was among the musical elite identified by their first names. She was Sarah, Sassy — the incomparable Sarah Vaughan.      Sarah Vaughan’s father, Asbury “Jake” Vaughan, was a carpenter and amateur guitarist. Her mother, Ada, was a laundress. Jake and Ada Vaughan migrated to Newark from Virginia during the First World War. Sarah was their only natural child, although in the 1960s they adopted Donna, the child of a woman who traveled on the road with Sarah Vaughan. The Vaughans lived in a house on Newark’s Brunswick street for Sarah’s entire childhood. Jake Vaughan was deeply religious and the family was very active in the New Mount Zion Baptist Church on 186 Thomas Street. Sarah began piano lessons at the age of seven, sang in the church choir and occasionally played piano for rehearsals and service. Vaughan developed an early love for popular music on records and the radio. In the 1930s, Newark had a very active live music scene and Vaughan frequently saw local and touring bands that played in the city. Vaughan initially attended Newark’s East Side High School, later transferring to Newark Arts High School, which had opened in 1931 as the United States’ first arts “magnet” high school.[2] However, her nocturnal adventures as a performer began to overwhelm her academic pursuits and Vaughan dropped out of high school during her junior year to concentrate more fully on music. Around this time, Vaughan and her friends also began venturing across the Hudson River into New York City to hear big bands at Harlem’s Ballroom and Apollo Theater. Vaughan was frequently accompanied by a friend, Doris Robinson, on her trips into New York City. Sometime in the Fall of 1942 (when Sarah was 18 years old), Vaughan suggested that Robinson enter the Apollo Amateur Night contest. Vaughan played piano accompaniment for Robinson, who won second prize. Vaughan later decided to go back and compete herself as a singer
