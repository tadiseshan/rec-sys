John Ondrasik was born in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. He grew up there in a musical family, with his mother teaching him the piano from the age of two. As a teenager, he learned how to play the guitar as well and started to write music. While he also learned to sing opera briefly, he quickly decided that he would like to be a piano playing popular musician along the lines of [Elton John](http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John) and [Billy Joel](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel). Ondrasik adopted the name “Five for Fighting” which is an expression in ice hockey when a player is sent from the rink by the referee for a major penalty. The name was used for the reason that it would be more memorable than his real name.      In 1997, his first album, ‘_[Message For Albert](http://www.last.fm/music/Five+for+Fighting/Message+For+Albert)_’, was released by EMI. Although not quite breaking through commercially, fans of modern [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) music provided a warm audience for Ondrasik. After the success of ‘_[America Town](http://www.last.fm/music/Five+for+Fighting/America+Town)_’, [Capitol Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Capitol+Records) re-released this debut album to give it a more mainstream audience.      In 2000, Ondrasik signed with the aforementioned Columbia Records and released ‘_[America Town](http://www.last.fm/music/Five+for+Fighting/America+Town)_’ on September 26, 2000. At first, it made little impact until track “[Superman (It’s Not Easy)](http://www.last.fm/music/Five+for+Fighting/_/Superman+\(It%27 s+Not+Easy\))” became an American anthem after the September 11 attacks. Ondrasik performed the song at ‘The Concert for New York Cit’y in late 2001
