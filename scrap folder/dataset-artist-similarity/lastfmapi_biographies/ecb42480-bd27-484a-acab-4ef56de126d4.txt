[Judee Sill](http://www.last.fm/music/Judee+Sill) (October 7, 1944 - November 23, 1979) was an American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer- songwriter). The first artist signed to David Geffen’s [Asylum](http://www.last.fm/label/Asylum) label, she released two albums before disappearing into obscurity and eventually dying of drug abuse in 1979.      Her eponymous debut album was released to major acclaim in 1971 and was followed two years later by [Heart Food](http://www.last.fm/music/Judee+Sill/Heart+Food). She recorded demos for a third album in 1974 and they were released in 2005 under the title [Dreams Come True](http://www.last.fm/music/Judee+Sill/Dreams+Come+True).      Sill was heavily influenced by Bach’s metric forms and suites, while lyrically her work drew substantially on Christian themes of rapture and redemption.      Judee’s father and brother both died in separate incidents when Judee was quite young. Her mother’s subsequent marriage to Tom and Jerry animator Kenneth Muse was marked by heavy drinking, and this, combined with her rebellious nature, drove her away from home and into a life of crime and drug use in her teens.      Having learned her signature [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel)-inflected keyboard style during her incarceration for writing bad checks, Sill kicked her heroin addiction and decided to pursue songwriting. Now a talented pianist, organist and guitarist, Sill returned to the West Coast where she encountered [Graham Nash](http://www.last.fm/music/Graham+Nash) and [David Crosby](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Crosby) (touring with them for a time as their opening act) and [David Geffen](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Geffen) who offered her a contract with his nascent label. Her albums were received well by critics but found little commercial success. Judee struggled with drug addiction during phases again following a car accident and its resulting physical pain and dropped out of the music scene and died of a drug overdose in November of 1979.      It was through Geffen that she met [Graham Nash](http://www.last.fm/music/Graham+Nash), who quickly became a fan, and produced the first single for her album, “[Jesus Was a Cross Maker](http://www.last.fm/music/Judee+Sill/_/Jesus+Was+a+Cross+Maker).” The rest of Judee Sill was orchestrated and produced by [Bob Harris](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Harris), Sill’s ex-husband. Judee Sill was released in 1971 to immediate acclaim. Lushly orchestrated, the album featured Sill’s voice in multiple overdubs, often in a four-part chorale or fugue. The album fit in well with the light [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock )/[folk-rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk-rock) underpinnings of what came to be known as the “[laurel canyon sound](http://www.last.fm/tag/laurel%20canyon%20sound)” associated with other female [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter)s such as [Carole King](http://www.last
