**Rosanne Cash** (born May 24, 1955 in Memphis, Tennesee) is an American singer and songwriter. She is oldest daughter of [Johnny Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash) and his first wife, Vivian Liberto, born shortly before the release of her father’s first single. She is also the stepdaughter of [June Carter Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/June+Carter+Cash) and the stepsister of country singer [Carlene Carter](http://www.last.fm/music/Carlene+Carter).      Cash released her first single in 1979, a duet with [Bobby Bare](http://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Bare) called “We Don’t Need No Memories Hangin’ ‘Round”. Two years later, she had her first country No. 1 (and the biggest commercial hit of her career), “[Seven Year Ache](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/_/Seven+Year+Ache)”. Although Cash was a prominent country star throughout the ’80s, alongside fellow decade- defining artists [Emmylou Harris](http://www.last.fm/music/Emmylou+Harris), [Juice Newton](http://www.last.fm/music/Juice+Newton), and [Dolly Parton](http://www.last.fm/music/Dolly+Parton), her music was anything but traditional: She topped the charts with songs written not only by herself, but by her father (“[Tennessee Flat Top Box](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/_/Tennessee+Flat+Top+Box)”), [John Hiatt](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Hiatt) (“[The Way We Make A Broken Heart] (http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/_/The+Way+We+Make+A+Broken+Heart)”), [Tom Petty](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Petty) (“Never Be You”) and [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles) (“[I Don’t Want To Spoil The Pa rty](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/_/I+Don%27t+Want+To+Spoil+The+Party )”), “[I Don’t Know Why You Don’t Want Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Ca sh/_/I+Don%27t+Know+Why+You+Don%27t+Want+Me)”, which won her a Grammy in 1985, and “[It’s Such A Small World](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/_/It%27s+Such+A+Small+World)”, a 1987 duet with [Rodney Crowell](http://www.last.fm/music/Rodney+Crowell) on his album [Diamonds & Dirt](http://www.last.fm/music/Rodney+Crowell/Diamonds+&+Dirt), provided further hits. A sampling of these songs and more are included on the compilation [Hits 1979-1989](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/Hits+1979-1989). In 1979, she married Rodney Crowell, who was to produce most of her hit records. Their stormy marriage lasted until 1992; its break-up is chronicled in Cash’s [Interiors](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/Interiors) and in Crowell’s album [Life Is Messy](http://www.last.fm/music/Rodney+Crowell/Life+Is+Messy). Cash later married [John Leventhal](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Leventhal), who produced her albums [The Wheel](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/The+Wheel), [10 Song Demo](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/10+Song+Demo), [Rules Of Travel](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/Rules+Of+Travel), and [Black Cadillac](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash/Black+Cadillac)
