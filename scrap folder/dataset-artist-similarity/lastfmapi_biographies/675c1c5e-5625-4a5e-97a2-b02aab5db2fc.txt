Kathryn Dawn Lang, OC (born November 2, 1961), better known under her stage name, k.d. lang, is a Grammy Award-winning Canadian singer and songwriter. She is regarded as one of Canada’s foremost female vocalists, as well as a champion of legal equality for LGBT people.      Her singing talent has lent itself to a wide range of genres, although earlier works, such as ‘Angel With a Lariat’ and ‘Absolute Torch and Twang’ (the last of which won her a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance) were predominantly country, with hints of jazz and salsa. Later works, including Ingénue and All You Can Eat, were more pop-ish in execution. No matter the genre, all left her talent undeniable. She has since garnered four grammys and many other awards, and was even made an officer of the Order of Canada in 1996, Canada’s highest civilian honour.
