**Richard Galliano** is a Franco-Italian accordionist. He was born in December 1950 in Le Cannet in the very south of [France](http://www.last.fm/place/France), near Nice. At the age of four he started playing piano and accordion, following his Italian father Lucien.      Galliano has played with the most famous international artists and jazzmen including [Ron Carter](http://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Carter), [Chet Baker](http://www.last.fm/music/Chet+Baker), [Jan Garbarek](http://www.last.fm/music/Jan+Garbarek), [Michel Petrucciani](http://www.last.fm/music/Michel+Petrucciani), [Michel Portal](http://www.last.fm/music/Michel+Portal), [Toots Thielemans](http://www.last.fm/music/Toots+Thielemans), and [Claude Nougaro](http://www.last.fm/music/Claude+Nougaro).      In 1983 [Astor Piazzolla](http://www.last.fm/music/Astor+Piazzolla) invited Galliano to be the bandoneon soloist at the Comédie Française in his incidental music for Shakespeare’s _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_. This marked the beginning of a friendship between the two that lasted until Piazzolla’s death in 1992.
