The band’s current lineup consists of vocalist and guitarist [Jay Malinowski](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Malinowski), and bassist Eon Sinclair with [Sekou Lumumba](http://www.last.fm/music/Sekou+Lumumba) on drums.

Patrick Pengelly played drums for the band until January 2009. The band met while attending Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The band released their second album, [Sounding A Mosaic](http://www.last.fm/music/Bedouin+Soundclash/Sounding+A+Mosaic), in 2004. The album’s single [When the Night Feels My Song](http://www.last.fm/mus ic/Bedouin+Soundclash/_/When+the+Night+Feels+My+Song) was the band’s breakthrough single on Canadian radio, charting #1 on 102.1 The Edge CFNY and gaining airplay on commercial radio stations throughout Canada in the summer of 2005. The band released their follow-up record [Street Gospels](http://www.last.fm/music/Bedouin+Soundclash/Street+Gospels) on August 21, 2007.      During the recording of [Sounding A Mosaic](http://www.last.fm/music/Bedouin+Soundclash/Sounding+A+Mosaic), Bedouin Soundclash formed a close bond with producer [Darryl Jenifer](http://www.last.fm/music/Darryl+Jenifer) of [Bad Brains](http://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Brains), with whom they continue to work today. Despite drastic differences in sound, Bedouin Soundclash and Darryl Jenifer are set to release a collaborative Bad Brains vs. Bedouin Soundclash mash-up.      Bedouin Soundclash takes its name from a [dub](http://www.last.fm/tag/dub) record by an artist named [Badawi](http://www.last.fm/music/Badawi), released on ROIR Records in 1996. In an early practice, Malinowski exclaimed it sounded like Bedouin Soundclash, and the name was adopted. In 2006 the band began plans for its own imprint Pirates Blend which will release their own side projects and b-sides. The first two projects to be released are set to be a [Vernon Maytone](http://www.last.fm/music/Vernon+Maytone) solo project, and a Bad Brains mash-up, whose release is yet to be determined.      2005-2006      In the summer of 2005, Bedouin Soundclash appeared on the Vans Warped Tour bill, and had significant chart success in Great Britain, where Sounding a Mosaic reached #1 on the BBC 6 Music charts. They often perform with reggae legend Vernon Buckley from the 1970s reggae duo, The Maytones.      In 2006, Bedouin Soundclash held shows with a variety of performers including Ben Harper, Damian Marley, The Skatalites, Burning Spear and The Junction
