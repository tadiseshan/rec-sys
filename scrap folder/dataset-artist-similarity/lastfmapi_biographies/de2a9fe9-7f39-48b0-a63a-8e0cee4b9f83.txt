Jason Lytle (born 26 March 1969 in Modesto, California) is an American musician best known for his work in the indie rock group [Grandaddy](http://www.last.fm/music/Grandaddy) between 1992 and 2005. Since the group split, Lytle has continued to release music as a solo artist and in collaboration with other musicians (including being a member of indie rock band [Admiral Radley](http://www.last.fm/music/Admiral+Radley)). Grandaddy reformed in 2012 for a series of live shows.      Lytle’s first solo recording following the disbanding of Grandaddy, “Yours Truly, The Commuter” (released in 2009), was filled with the signature vintage synths, affecting melodies and fuzzed-out guitars that made Grandaddy a predominant force of the indie rock scene of the late 90s.      On December 7, 2009, Lytle independently released an EP of seven improvised piano recordings as a “Merry X-mas” gift to fans through his website on bandcamp.com.      Lytle joined with Aaron Burtch, a former Grandaddy bandmate, and Aaron Espinoza and Ariana Murray, of the band Earlimart, to form a new band called Admiral Radley. Their debut cd, entitled I Heart California, was released in the USA on July 13, 2010, on Espinoza’s The Ship label.      Lytle’s solo album, Dept. of Disappearance, was released October 16, 2012
