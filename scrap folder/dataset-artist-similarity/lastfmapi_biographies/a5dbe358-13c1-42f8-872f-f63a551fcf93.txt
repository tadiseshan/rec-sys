**Amel Larrieux** (born March 8, 1973) is a U.S. singer-songwriter and keyboard player. She was formerly lead vocalist of the ’90s R&B and soul group [Groove Theory](http://www.last.fm/music/Groove+Theory).      Larrieux was born and brought up in the neighborhood of Greenwich Village in New York City. Her mother was a dance critic and professor who encouraged Larrieux to grow up in a free-spirited, artistic environment. Many of her influences are drawn from R&B, soul, jazz, folk, hip-hop and gospel, with flashes of Middle Eastern, West African, and Indian ethnic styles. She lives in New York City with her husband and two daughters.      As a solo artist, her music is mostly categorized as fitting within the nu- soul genre, though she also dabbles in jazz, blues and gospel sounds. She sang lead vocals with Sade’s band Sweetback while Sade was on hiatus. On her last album ‘Lovely Standards’ she gravitated away from nu-soul to produce a cover album made up of songs from the jazz and blues singers that inspired her. Larrieux is also influenced by [Jimi Hendrix](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix), [Joni Mitchell](http://www.last.fm/music/Joni+Mitchell), [Stevie Wonder](http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder) and [Prince](http://www.last.fm/music/Prince) — as she has previously credited on her website.
