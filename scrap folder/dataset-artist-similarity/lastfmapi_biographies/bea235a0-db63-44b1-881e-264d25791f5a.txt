Juelz Santana (born LaRon Louis James on February 18, 1982) is a half African American and half Dominican rapper from Harlem, New York, who first became known for his “featured” status on [Cam’ron](http://www.last.fm/music/Cam%27ron)’s 2002 hits, “[Oh Boy](http://www.last.fm/music/Cam%27ron/_/Oh+Boy)” and “[Hey Ma](http://www.last.fm/music/Cam%27ron/_/Hey+Ma)”.      Santana began writing rhymes at the age of 12. He was originally signed to Priority Records as one half a duo called Draft Pick. The group had several shows around New York City while together, including Amateur Night at the Apollo Theatre, where they won two weeks in a row. Some time after this, he was introduced to [Cam’ron](http://www.last.fm/music/Cam%27ron) through a cousin; in 1998, he became a member of the group, [The Diplomats](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Diplomats), whose members include [Cam’ron](http://www.last.fm/music/Cam%27ron), [Jim Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Jones), [40 Cal](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/40+Cal), [J.R Writer](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/J.R+Writer), [Hell Rell](http://www.last.fm/music/Hell+Rell), [Jha Jha](http://www.last.fm/music/Jha+Jha), [S.A.S](http://www.last.fm/music/S.A.S), and [Freekey Zeekey](http://www.last.fm/music/Freekey+Zeekey). He is now signed as a solo artist to [Dipset](http://www.last.fm/music/Dipset) but unlike the rest of [The Diplomats](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Diplomats), who are signed to Koch Records, Santana is currently signed to [Def Jam](http://www.last.fm/label/Def+Jam).      He was voted #2 in the VIBE Vixen top 50 sexiest rappers behind T.I. at #1.      His first album, [From Me To You](http://www.last.fm/music/Juelz+Santana/From+Me+To+You) was released by [Roc-a-Fella Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Roc-a-Fella+Records) in 2003 featuring the singles “[Dipset (Santana’s Town)](http://www.last.fm/music/Juelz+Santana/_/Dipset+\(Santana%27s+Town\))” and “[Down](http://www.last.fm/music/Juelz+Santana/_/Down)”. It was considered a commerical failure when compared to the sucess of Cam’ron’s [Come Home With Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Cam%27ron/Come+Home+With+Me) and [The Diplomats](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Diplomats)’ [Diplomatic Immunity](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Diplomats/Diplomatic+Immunity).      In his latest work, his second album, What The Game’s Been Missing!, features the singles “[There It Go! (The Whistle Song)](http://www.last.fm/music/Juelz+ Santana/_/There+It+Go!+\(The+Whistle+Song\))”, and “[Oh Yes](http://www.last.fm/music/Juelz+Santana/_/Oh+Yes)” as he continues his unique flow. He was featured in [Chris Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Brown)’s #1 hit “Run It!” and in the remix of [Mariah Carey](http://www.last.fm/music/Mariah+Carey)’s # 1 single “Don’t Forget About Us”.
