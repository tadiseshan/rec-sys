William Daron Pulliam (October 5, 1946 – June 9, 2013), who performed in the 1970s under the name Darondo, was a funk and soul singer from the San Francisco Bay Area. Although he is not widely recognized today, serious enthusiasts of the soul genre consistently rate him in high regard. The mythology surrounding Darondo describes him as a pimp, although he has denied this claim. His performing name is said to have originated as a compliment from a waitress who was fond of his generous tipping habits. He has received more attention in recent years thanks to London DJ Gilles Peterson playing his 1973 single, “Didn’t I” on his BBC Radio 1 program.      In 2007, Darondo’s song “Didn’t I” was covered by Jack Peñate on his Spit At Stars EP and in 2008, featured on an episode (season 1, episode 4) of Breaking Bad. “Didn’t I” was also featured in the 2010 film Saint John of Las Vegas in a scene featuring Steve Buscemi. In 2009, the song “Legs” was featured in an episode (season 1, episode 8) of the American version of Life on Mars. In 2010, “Didn’t I” was featured in the films Night Catches Us and Jack Goes Boating. It also appeared in the New Element video, Future Nature.      Recordings of Darondo are available from Luv N Haight, an imprint label of Ubiquity Records. Other works can be purchased from Omnivore Recordings.

All three singles were recorded in the San Francisco Bay Area, and both sides of each of the singles are fantastic productions. But after the release of his three 45s Darondo stopped recording.
