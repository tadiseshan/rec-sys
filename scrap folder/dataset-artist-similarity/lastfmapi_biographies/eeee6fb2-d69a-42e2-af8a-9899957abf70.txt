Azure Ray is an American indie duo, consisting of musicians [Maria Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Maria+Taylor) and [Orenda Fink](http://www.last.fm/music/Orenda+Fink). Azure Ray started in Athens, Georgia, in 2001 and later relocated to Omaha, Nebraska and joined the music scene there, leading to collaborations with [Bright Eyes](http://www.last.fm/music/Bright+Eyes) and [Now It’s Overhead](http://www.last.fm/music/Now+It%27s+Overhead), among others. Their sound is sparse and understated, with intimate lyrics, elements of alt-country and folk Americana, and occasional forays into minimalist electronica.      Azure Ray disbanded in 2004 and Maria and Orenda have released solo albums on Saddle Creek Records.      Azure Ray reunited in 2009 after a hiatus of more than five years and began touring again with other Saddle Creek artists as supporting members, notably Andy LeMaster of [Now It’s Overhead](http://www.last.fm/music/Now+It%27s+Overhead).      The duo released their new full-length album “Drawing Down the Moon” in the fall of 2010.
