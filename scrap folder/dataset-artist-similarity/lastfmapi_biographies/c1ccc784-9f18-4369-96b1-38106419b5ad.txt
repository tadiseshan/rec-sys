Tina Arena (born Filippina Lydia Arena on 1 November 1967, in Melbourne, [Australia](http://www.last.fm/place/Australia)) is an Australian singer and songwriter.      Her career began at the age of seven when she was selected as a regular performer for the music television program Young Talent Time. As a child Arena attracted attention for the power of her voice, which was considered remarkable for such a young child.      She was born to Italian parents and has a sister, Nancy (born 1961). Often billed as “Tiny Tina Arena”, she was seen on weekly television singing and dancing the current pop hits. The show’s policy was to promote talented children, and at the age of sixteen team members would leave, ostensibly to follow an adult career. As one of the show’s youngest performers, Arena’s nine year stint was also one of the show’s longest. “Strong As Steel” Like most of the children who left the show, Arena carried with her a stigma that made it difficult to be taken seriously as an adult vocalist, and for a short time she contemplated ending her career, and found employment with an insurance company. She was invited to support Lionel Richie on his Australian tour, but despite this success and the profile it gave her, record companies were unwilling to offer her a recording contract. Arena persevered, playing nightclubs in Melbourne and in several stage musicals, before finally being offered a contract.      Her album **Strong as Steel**, released in 1990, contained one major hit single, the uptempo dance track, **”I Need Your Body”**, whose accompanying video demonstrated Arena as a sexy and confident adult. The contrast between her adult image and that of the seven year old child she had been when she first became famous attracted considerable publicity in Australia, but some elements of the media insisted that she was little more than a novelty act. Despite the success of the further singles, **The Machine’s Breaking Down** and the Diane Warren title track, the album failed to establish her as a major act, and she relocated to the United States.      After signing a contract with Sony Music, Arena released the album **Don’t Ask** in 1994. It became one of the highest selling albums of the year in Australia and provided her with her first substantial hit single **”Chains”**. The song also reached the Top 10 in the United Kingdom and Top 40 in the United States. Arena’s career was said to be a priority of record executive Tommy Mottola who envisioned her achieving the level of success of Céline Dion or Mariah Carey, but the album failed to sell well in the US, and Mottola moved on to other projects. Other hits followed in Australia and Europe, including **”Heaven Help My Heart”**, **”Wasn’t It Good”** and **”Sorrento Moon”**
