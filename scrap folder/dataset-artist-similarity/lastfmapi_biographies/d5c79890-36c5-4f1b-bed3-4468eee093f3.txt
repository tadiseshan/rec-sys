Solomon Burke (born March 21, 1940 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, died October 10, 2010 at Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands) was a [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) music pioneer and member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Despite releasing numerous [rnb](http://www.last.fm/tag/rnb) chart hits in the 1960s, he never had a Top 20 hit on the pop charts. Burke’s influence, however, has outstripped his mainstream commercial success. He is considered a legend of American music.      He began his adult life as a young preacher in Philadelphia, where he hosted a gospel radio show. In the 1960s, he signed with [Atlantic Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Atlantic+Records) and began moving towards more secular music. His first hit was [Just Out Of Reach Of My Open Arms](http ://www.last.fm/music/Solomon+Burke/_/Just+Out+Of+Reach+Of+My+Open+Arms), a cover of a country song. Though well-received by both peers and critics, and attaining a few moderate pop and several major R&B hits, Burke never could quite break through into the mainstream as did his contemporaries like [Sam Cooke](http://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Cooke), [Otis Redding](http://www.last.fm/music/Otis+Redding) and [Aretha Franklin](http://www.last.fm/music/Aretha+Franklin).      Nevertheless, his emotive delivery, polished production, as well as the touches of country and pop sensibility in his music won him admirers and imitators. In 1964 he wrote and recorded [Everybody Needs Somebody To Love](ht tp://www.last.fm/music/Solomon+Burke/_/Everybody+Needs+Somebody+To+Love) his most prominent bid for an enduring soul standard. Covered by the [Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Rolling+Stones) the same year, other well-known versions include one by [Wilson Pickett](http://www.last.fm/music/Wilson+Pickett) and another a decade and a half later in the 1980 feature film by [The Blues Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Blues+Brothers). Burke’s biggest hit was a 1969 [cover](http://www.last.fm/tag/cover) of [Creedence Clearwater Revival](http://www.last.fm/music/Creedence+Clearwater+Revival)’s [Proud Mary](http://www.last.fm/music/Solomon+Burke/_/Proud+Mary).      His career was to some degree revived in 2002, with the release of the album [Don’t Give Up on Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Solomon+Burke/Don%27t+Give+Up+on+Me), produced by Joe Henry, where he sang songs written specifically for the album by a roster of top-rank artists, including [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan), [Brian Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson), [Van Morrison](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Morrison), [Elvis Costello](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello), [Tom Waits](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits) and [Joe Henry](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Henry) himself.      He is featured in the 2004 movie Lightning in a Bottle singing [Turn On Your Love Light](http://www.last.fm/music/Solomon+Burke/_/Turn+On+Your+Love+Light) and [Down in the Valley](http://www.last
