Miriam Makeba, also known as Mama Africa, was beyond dispute one of South Africa’s true legends. Born March 4, 1932 in Johannesburg, Miriam Makeba was barely 21 years old when she, as a member of [ the Manhattan Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/Manhattan+Brothers), reached for the stars in her home country. It didn’t take long before Miriam Makeba’s career was brought to another level. In 1966 she received a Grammy Award for the album [An Evening with Harry Belafonte & Miriam Makeba](http://www.last.fm/music/Har ry%2BBelafonte%2B%252F%2BHarry%2BBelafonte/An%2BEvening%2BWith%2BBelafonte%252 Fmake), making her the first African artist to win a Grammy. Her star rose further when she released her 1967 globally acclaimed [Pata Pata](http://www.last.fm/music/Miriam+Makeba/Pata+Pata), including the worldwide hit “Qongqothwane” (better known as the ‘Click Song’). Shortly thereafter she published her [autobiography ](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/ful lpage.html?res=940DE1DA143CF93BA35750C0A96E948260).      Miriam Makeba used her voice to entertain, but also to give a voice to millions of oppressed fellow South Africans who suffered as a result of apartheid. The price she had to pay for her actions was high, namely her South African citizenship. After she appeared, in 1960, in the an anti-apartheid documentary [Come Back, Africa](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049087/), the South African regime banned her from returning to her home country and took away her citizenship.      This event didn’t stop her from continuing to raise her voice against the apartheid regime. Between 1964 and 1975, as a United Nations delegate of Guinea where she was granted asylum, Miriam Makeba addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations regularly on the tragic developments in South Africa.      Meanwhile she carried on singing, a process in which she put South African music on the map. Over the years Makeba worked with artists as [Joe Sample](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Sample), [Stix Hooper](http://www.last.fm/music/Stix+Hooper), [Arthur Adams](http://www.last.fm/music/Arthur+Adams), and [David T. Walker](http://www.last.fm/music/David+T.+Walker) of [ The Crusaders](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Crusaders). In the late 1980’s she joined [Paul Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon) and [Ladysmith Black Mambazo](http://www.last.fm/music/Ladysmith+Black+Mambazo) during their world- wide Graceland tour and in 1990 she worked with [Odetta](http://www.last.fm/music/Odetta) and [Nina Simone](http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Simone) for the One Nation tour.      Following Nelson Mandela’s release from prison, the citizen of the world Makeba returned to South Africa in December 1990; more than thirty years after she went in exile. In April 1991 she performed her first concert in her homeland in three decades.      The years after were busy ones for Makeba. She starred in the South African award-winning musical [Sarafina! ](http://en.wikipedia
