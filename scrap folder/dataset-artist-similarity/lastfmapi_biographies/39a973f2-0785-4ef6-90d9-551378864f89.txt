Rapper, DJ, and producer Pete Rock first emerged in 1991 as one half of a duo with C.L. Smooth, debuting with the [All Souled Out](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Rock+&+C.L.+Smooth/All+Souled+Out) EP. A hit LP, [Mecca and the Soul Brother](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Rock+&+C.L. +Smooth/Mecca+and+the+Soul+Brother), followed before the two went their separate ways in the wake of 1994’s [The Main Ingredient](http://www.last.fm/m usic/Pete+Rock+&+C.L.+Smooth/The+Main+Ingredient), with Rock remaining a prolific studio presence prior to the release of his solo debut, Soul Survivor, on [Loud](http://www.last.fm/label/Loud)/[rca](http://www.last.fm/label/rca) four years later. Dropped from the label, he continued his career as an independent producer, and later signed to Rapster/[Bbe](http://www.last.fm/label/Bbe) in 2001 for [PeteStrumentals](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Rock/PeteStrumentals). Two years later, the label released a two-part compilation of mid-’90s LPs with Lost and Found. In 2004, Rock produced the sequel to his debut, Soul Survivor II, with features coming from [Pharaohe Monch](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Pharaohe+Monch), [dead prez](http://www.last.fm/music/dead+prez), [Talib Kweli](http://www.last.fm/music/Talib+Kweli), and former partner C.L. Smooth.
