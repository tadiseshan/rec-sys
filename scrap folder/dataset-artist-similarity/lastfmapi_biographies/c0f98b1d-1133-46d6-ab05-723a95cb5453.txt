Obie Trice III (born November 14, 1977) is an American [rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/rap) artist and songwriter. He began rapping at the age of 11, and is most known for his time spent signed to Shady Records. He also has his own record label, Black Market Entertainment.      Obie Trice III was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan by his mother, along with three brothers. He is of African American and German descent. Trice was given a karaoke machine by his mother when he was eleven and he used it to rhyme over instrumentals from artists such as N.W.A. By the age of fourteen, he was attending rap battle spots around Detroit, notably including the Hip Hop Shop.      Obie Trice went by the name of Obie 1 during this time, but when he first met Proof, who was about to introduce him at the Hip Hop Shop, Proof asked him, “What’s your name? Your real name, no gimmicks.” He was then introduced as Obie Trice, and has kept his real name as his rap name. Trice was introduced to Eminem through D12 member Bizarre. Hot Rapper: Obie Trice. Rolling Stone. Accessed January 22, 2008. Later, Trice received a call from his manager informing him that he would be having dinner with Eminem, and later that night they went to a Kid Rock party.      **Before first major release, early years on Shady Records**      As an acquaintance of [D12](http://www.last.fm/music/D12) member [Bizarre](http://www.last.fm/music/Bizarre), Obie was signed after a personal introduction to [Eminem](http://www.last.fm/music/Eminem) allowed him to impress the Detroit rap legend in-person. The general public were first introduced to Obie on D12’s Devil’s Night album on a skit. His one-line opener (“Obie Trice: Real name, no gimmicks” - taken from his song “Rap Name” and referring to the lack of a rap pseudonym) on Eminem’s lead single; “Without Me”, off the critically-acclaimed and commercially successful The Eminem Show increased public awareness of his name and slogan. Obie also appeared in the video for the song, body-slamming a dummy representing Moby. Appearances on [DJ Green Lantern](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Green+Lantern)’s official Shady Records Invasion mixtape series, allowed him to further his public recognition.      In 2002, Trice appeared in 8 Mile as one of the rappers in the Chin Tiki parking lot scene. Trice also has a featured appearance as Big Pimpin’ in the Detroit made independent feature film Life Goes On, which will premiere at the Cannes International Film Festival in May 2006.      A short while before the first Invasion mixtape was released, he became involved in the Eminem-Benzino beef after being called out by Benzino with the line “Obie Trice/You’s a buster” in a diss-track directed at Eminem and Shady Records. In response to Benzino, Obie released the track “Welcome to Detroit City” (a track over the beat from [Cam’ron](http://www.last.fm/music/Cam%27ron)’s song “Welcome to New York City”) on the first Invasion mixtape
