Dr. **Yusef Lateef** (born William Emanuel Huddleston, October 9, 1920 – December 23, 2013) was an American [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) [multi- instrumentalist](http://www.last.fm/tag/multi-instrumentalist), [composer](http://www.last.fm/tag/composer) and educator and a renowned spokesman for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community after his conversion to Islam in 1950. Lateef was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, but his family moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1925.      Although Lateef’s main instruments are the tenor saxophone and flute, he is known for his innovative blending of jazz with Eastern music. In addition to the oboe and bassoon, both rare in jazz, Lateef plays various non-Western instruments, notably the bamboo flute, shanai, shofar, arghul, sarewa, and koto.      Throughout his early life Lateef came into contact with many Detroit-based jazz musicians who would gain prominence, including vibraphonist [Milt Jackson](http://www.last.fm/music/Milt+Jackson), bassist [Paul Chambers](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Chambers), drummer Elvin Jones, and guitarist Kenny Burrell. Lateef was a proficient saxophonist by the time of his graduation from high school at age 18, at which point he launched his professional career and began touring with a number of swing bands.      In 1949, Lateef was invited by [Dizzy Gillespie](http://www.last.fm/music/Dizzy+Gillespie) to tour with his world- renowned orchestra. At this time, Lateef was known by the name William Evans, thereby making him one of three well-known jazz musicians (besides the pianist and the tenor saxophonist) bearing this name. Notably, all three played with Miles Davis during their careers.      In 1950, Lateef returned to Detroit and began his studies in composition and flute at Wayne State University. It was during this period that Lateef converted to Islam as a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.      Lateef began recording as a leader in 1957 for [Savoy](http://www.last.fm/label/Savoy) Records, a non-exclusive association which continued until 1959; the earliest of Lateef’s album’s for the [Prestige](http://www.last.fm/label/Prestige) subsidiary [New Jazz](http://www.last.fm/label/New+Jazz) overlap with them. Musicians such as [Wilbur Harden](http://www.last.fm/music/Wilbur+Harden) and [Hugh Lawson](http://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Lawson) were among his collaborators during this period.      In 1960, Lateef again returned to school, studying flute at the Manhattan School of Music in New York. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in Music in 1969 and a Master’s Degree in Music Education in 1970. Starting in 1971, he taught courses in “autophysiopsychic” music at the Manhattan School of Music, and he became an associate professor at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in 1972.      Autophysiopsychic Music, Lateef’s term, refers to music which comes from one’s physical, mental, and spiritual self
