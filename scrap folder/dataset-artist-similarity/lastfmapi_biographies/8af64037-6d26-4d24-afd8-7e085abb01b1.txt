The Impressions were an American music group from Chicago, Illinois, active from 1958 until 1983, whose repertoire included [doo- wop](http://www.last.fm/tag/doo-wop), [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel), [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul), and R&B.      The group was founded as The Roosters by Chattanooga, Tennessee natives Sam Gooden, Richard Brooks, and Arthur Brooks, who moved to Chicago, Illinois and added [Jerry Butler](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Butler) and [Curtis Mayfield](http://www.last.fm/music/Curtis+Mayfield) to their lineup to become [Jerry Butler & The Impressions](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Butler+&+The+Impressions). By 1962, Butler and the Brookses had departed, and after switching to ABC- Paramount Records, Mayfield, Gooden, and new Impression Fred Cash collectively became a top-selling soul act. Mayfield left the group for a solo career in 1970; [Leroy Hutson](http://www.last.fm/music/Leroy+Hutson), [Ralph Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/Ralph+Johnson), Reggie Torian, and [Nate Evans](http://www.last.fm/music/Nate+Evans) were among the replacements who joined Gooden and Cash before the group’s demise in 1983.      Inductees into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, The Impressions are best known for their 1960s string of hits, many of which were heavily influenced by gospel music and served as inspirational anthems for the Civil Rights Movement.
