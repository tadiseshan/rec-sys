Material Issue was a [power pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/power%20pop) [power trio](http://www.last.fm/tag/power%20trio) from Chicago, Illinois. Their trademark was a brand of dense, rich, manic, and powerful [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) tunes. Their lyrics revolved heavily around themes of love and heartbreak, having a phalanx of girl’s-first-name-titled songs. Singles such as “[Diane](http://www.last.fm/music/Material+Issue/_/Diane)” and “[Valerie Loves Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Material+Issue/_/Valerie+Loves+Me)” remain staples of [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) radio. Formed in 1985, Material Issue was the brainchild of frontman Jim Ellison (who also played guitar, provided lead vocals, and wrote all Material Issue songs). Their early days featured a revolving door of bass players and drummers.      However, Ellison met bassist [Ted Ansani](http://www.last.fm/music/Ted+Ansani) while both were attending Columbia Music School in Chicago in 1986, and they soon hit it off. Drummer Mike Zelenko was recruited when the duo found him through an ad in the ‘Illinois Entertainer’ later that year. With the Material Issue lineup set, Ellison– with Ansani and Zelenko eager to join him and ready to follow– set his sights on conquering the pop/rock world.      In 1987, Material Issue released an EP on their own Big Block Label, so named for the big block engines of the 1970s muscle cars Ellison loved) which. That label operated out of Ellison’s bedroom at his parents home in Addison, Illinois. In 1988, “[Sixteen Tambourines](http://www.last.fm/music/Material+Issue/_/Sixteen+Tambourines)” appeared on College Music Journal’s compliation and CMJ glowingly referred to Material Issue’s music as a “hooky brand of high-powered psycho-pop”. In 1989, their buzz grew further with the release of the single “[Renee Remains The Same](http://www.last.fm/music/Material+Issue/_/Renee+Remains+The+Same)” which got heavy airplay around Chicago and seemed poised to be an underground rock smash.      Over the next two years, the band toured extensively across the midwest and found time to record what would become their debut album. In early 1991, Material Issue broke on to the national scene with their debut album International Pop Overthrow (IPO) which sold over 300,000 copies for Polygram Records. Ironically enough, their debut video for the single “Diane” appeared on MTV’s 120 Minutes in late December 1990 which was the episode of the final appearance of Paul Westerberg and Tommy Stinson of The Replacements in sort of a fitting segue between the lesser-known music genres of the two decades (Material Issue and The Replacements would share the stage at Taste of Chicago in 1991 which would prove to be the swansong for The Replacements). IPO spawned nationwide radio hits “Diane” and “Valerie Loves Me” which were just as popular in Chicago as they were in places such as Phoenix, Minneapolis and Dallas
