Serge Gainsbourg (April 2, 1928 – March 2, 1991) was a [french](http://www.last.fm/tag/french) poet-songwriter, singer, actor, novelist, painter and director. Gainsbourg’s varied style and individuality made him difficult to categorize. Although famous in France for many years, he did not achieve his first No. 1 album until 1979, when he released Aux Armes et caetera more than twenty years after his music career had begun. But since the 1980s, his legacy has been firmly established.      He was born Lucien Ginzburg in Paris, France, the son of Jewish Russian parents who fled to France after the 1917 Bolshevik uprising. His childhood was profoundly affected by the occupation of France by Nazi Germany, during which he and his family, as Jews, were forced to wear the yellow star and eventually flee from Paris. He had a daughter, [Charlotte Gainsbourg](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Gainsbourg), with English singer and actress Jane Birkin; and a son, Lulu, with his last partner, Bambou (Caroline Von Paulus, who is related to Friedrich Paulus). Before he was 30 years old, Lucien Ginsburg was a disillusioned painter but earned his living as a piano player in bars. Daughter Charlotte would later become an actress and singer.      His early songs were influenced by [Boris Vian](http://www.last.fm/music/Boris+Vian) and were largely in the vein of “old-fashioned” chanson. Very early, however, Gainsbourg began to move beyond this and experiment with a succession of different musical styles: [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) early on, [english pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/english%20pop) in the 60’s, [reggae](http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae) in the 70’s, even [hip- hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) in the 80’s.      Success began to arrive when, in 1965, his song “Poupée de cire, poupée de son” was the Luxembourg entry in the Eurovision Song Contest. Performed by French teen singer [France Gall](http://www.last.fm/music/France+Gall), it won the grand prize. (The song was covered in English as “A Lonely Singing Doll” by British teen idol [Twinkle](http://www.last.fm/music/Twinkle).) He arranged other Gall songs and LPs that were characteristic of the late 1960s psychedelic styles, among them Gall’s ‘1968’ album. Another of Serge’s songs “Boum Bada Boum” was entered in by Monaco in the 1967 contest, sung by Minouche Barelli; It came 5th.      In 1969, he released what would become his most famous song in the English- speaking world, “Je t’aime… moi non plus”, which featured simulated sounds of female orgasm. The song appeared that year on an LP, “[Jane Birkin](http://www.last.fm/music/Jane+Birkin)/Serge Gainsbourg”. Originally recorded with [Brigitte Bardot](http://www.last.fm/music/Brigitte+Bardot), it was released with future girlfriend Birkin when Bardot backed out. While Gainsbourg declared it the “ultimate love song,” it was considered too “hot”; the song was censored in various countries, and in France, even the toned-down version was suppressed
