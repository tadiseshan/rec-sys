**Bill Withers** (born July 4, 1938 in Slab Fork, West Virginia) is an American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) who performed and recorded from the late 1960s until the mid 1980s.      Bill’s father died when he was thirteen. He joined the US Navy at seventeen, and stayed there for nine years, before he moved to Los Angeles in 1967. While in Los Angeles, he worked full-time in a Lockheed assembly plant in the day, recording demo tapes and performing in juke joints during the night. When he debuted on the music scene with “[Ain’t No Sunshine](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/_/Ain%27t+No+Sunshine),” he refused to give up his job at Lockheed because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other working acts like [The Temptations](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Temptations) or [Sammy Davis, Jr.](http://www.last.fm/music/Sammy+Davis,+Jr.)      His first success was with the company [Sussex Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Sussex+Records) in 1971 with his debut hit single [Ain’t No Sunshine](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/_/Ain%27t+No+Sunshine) on the album [Just As I Am](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/Just+As+I+Am). He assembled a touring band made up of: drummer [James Gadson](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Gadson), guitarist Bernoce Blackmon, keyboardist [Ray jackson](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+jackson), and bassist [Melvin Dunlap](http://www.last.fm/music/Melvin+Dunlap).      His second album [Still Bill](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/Still+Bill) also did well on the charts. It was recorded during a break in the “Just As I Am” tour and included the well-known single “[Lean on Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/_/Lean+on+Me),” which went to #1 on the charts on July 8, 1972. His live album, “[Bill Withers, Live at Carnegie H all](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/Bill+Withers,+Live+at+Carnegie+Hall ),” released in 1973, was one of the best live albums to be released during the 1970s. Other popular songs he sings are “[Use Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/_/Use+Me)” and “[Lovely Day](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/_/Lovely+Day),” as well as “[Just the Two of Us](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/_/Just+the+Two+of+Us),” which he performed with [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) saxophonist [Grover Washington Jr.](http://www.last.fm/music/Grover+Washington+Jr.)      His songs have been covered by many singers and rappers. [Club Nouveau](http://www.last.fm/music/Club+Nouveau)’s 1986 cover of “[Lean On Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Club+Nouveau/_/Lean+On+Me),” which is now often used in many churches, earned Withers his third Grammy as a [songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/songwriter). Ten years earlier, the British [glam rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/glam%20rock) band [Mud](http://www.last.fm/music/Mud) took the song to No. 7 in the UK pop charts. [Grace Jones](http://www.last
