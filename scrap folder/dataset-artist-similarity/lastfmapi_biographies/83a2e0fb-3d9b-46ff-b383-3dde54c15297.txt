Hugh Masekela (born Johannesburg, April 4, 1939) is a South African flugelhorn and cornet player. In 1961, as part of the anti-apartheid campaign, he was exiled to the [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States) where he was befriended by [Harry Belafonte](http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Belafonte). He has played primarily in [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) ensembles, with guest appearances on albums by [The Byrds](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Byrds) and [Paul Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon). In 1987, he had a hit single with “[Bring Him Back Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Masekela/_/Bring+Him+Back+Home)” which became an anthem for the movement to free Nelson Mandela. After apartheid ended, Masekela returned to South Africa where he now lives.      Hugh Masekela was an old collaborator of [Abdullah Ibrahim](http://www.last.fm/music/Abdullah+Ibrahim). He is reported to have been initially inspired in his musical growth by Trevor Huddleston, a British priest working in the South African townships who financed Masekela’s first trumpet. Masekela played his way through the vibrant Sophiatown scene with [The Jazz Epistles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jazz+Epistles) and to Britain with [King Kong](http://www.last.fm/music/King+Kong), to find himself in New York in the early 1960s. He had hits in the United States with the [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) tunes “[Up, Up and Away](http://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Masekela/_/Up,+Up+and+Away)” and the number one smash “[Grazin’ in the Grass](http://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Masekela/_/Grazin%27+in+the+Grass)”.      A renewed interest in his African roots led him to collaborate with West and Central African musicians, and finally to reconnect with South African players when he set up a mobile studio in [Botswana](http://www.last.fm/place/Botswana), just over the South African border, in the 1980s. Here he re-absorbed and re-used [mbaqanga](http://www.last.fm/tag/mbaqanga) strains, a style he has continued to use since his return to South Africa in the early 1990s.      In the 1980s, he toured with [Paul Simon](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon) in support of Simon’s then controversial, but highly critically acclaimed, album [Graceland](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon/Graceland), which featured other South African artists such as [Ladysmith Black Mambazo](http://www.last.fm/music/Ladysmith+Black+Mambazo), [Miriam Makeba](http://www.last.fm/music/Miriam+Makeba), [Ray Phiri](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Phiri), and other elements of the band [Kalahari](http://www.last.fm/music/Kalahari), which Masekela recorded with in the 1980s. He also collaborated in the musical development for the Broadway play, Sarafina! He previously recorded with the band [Kalahari](http://www.last.fm/music/Kalahari).      In 2003, he was featured in the documentary film Amandla!, about how the music of South Africa aided in the struggle against apartheid
