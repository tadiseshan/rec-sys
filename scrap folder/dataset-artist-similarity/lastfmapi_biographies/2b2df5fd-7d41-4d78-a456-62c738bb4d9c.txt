**Jill Sobule** (born January 16, 1965 in Denver, Colorado) is an American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) best known for the then-controversial song, [I Kissed a Girl](http://www.last.fm/music/Jill+Sobule/_/I+Kissed+a+Girl) (not to be confused with the 2008 [Katy Perry](http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry) hit song of the same name) and for [Supermodel](http://www.last.fm/music/Jill+Sobule/_/Supermodel) from the soundtrack of the hit 1995 film _Clueless_. In 1990, she released her debut album [Things Here Are Different](http://www.last.fm/music/Jill+Sobule/Things+Here+Are+Different). Over the next sixteen years, she would go on to record five more records, three EPs and a greatest hits compilation. Though her albums are often critically acclaimed, Sobule remains more of an [underground](http://www.last.fm/tag/underground) artist, playing for fans across the [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States) in smaller, more personal settings.      In many of her songs, she incorporates [humor](http://www.last.fm/tag/humor) into a narrative, some tracks ultimately becoming catchy anecdotes. Generally, her songs are unconventionally [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk)-like, using horn arrangements not found in tracks recorded by mainstream artists. Sobule also uses both satire and experience to sing about sexuality, depression, war, abandonment, and creed.
