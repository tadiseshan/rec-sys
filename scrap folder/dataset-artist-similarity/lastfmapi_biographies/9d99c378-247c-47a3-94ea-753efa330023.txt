**Charles L. Byrd** (September 16, 1925 - November 30, 1999), better known as **Charlie Byrd**, was a famous [jazz guitar](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20guitar)ist, born in Suffolk, Virginia. He was the only [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) guitarist of that era whose primary instrument was the classical guitar which gave him his uniquely identifiable sound.      **Byrd** primarily looked up to [Django Reinhardt](http://www.last.fm/music/Django+Reinhardt). He moved to Washington, D.C., to study classical guitar with the renowned [Sophocles Papas](http://www.last.fm/music/Sophocles+Papas). He later moved to Italy where he studied with [Andrés Segovia](http://www.last.fm/music/Andr%C3%A9s+Segovia). In the early 1960’s he was on a State Department tour in South America where he was introduced to a new music, the [bossa nova](http://www.last.fm/tag/bossa%20nova), which was the musical passion of Brazil beginning in the late 50’s. Jazz saxophonist [Stan Getz](http://www.last.fm/music/Stan+Getz) had been in Brazil about six months earlier than Byrd, also on a State Department tour, where he, too, was exposed to the [bossa nova](http://www.last.fm/tag/bossa%20nova). A short time later Getz called Byrd in D.C. and suggested the idea that they collaborate on a [bossa nova](http://www.last.fm/tag/bossa%20nova) album. That album was the introduction of [bossa nova](http://www.last.fm/tag/bossa%20nova) to North America.      He is perhaps most well known as a collaborator with [Stan Getz](http://www.last.fm/music/Stan+Getz) on the [Jazz Samba](http://www.last.fm/music/Stan+Getz/Jazz+Samba) album, which featured many themes of [bossa nova](http://www.last.fm/tag/bossa%20nova), and of course, [samba](http://www.last.fm/tag/samba).
