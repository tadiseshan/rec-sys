Beresford Hammond (b.August 28,1955 Annotto Bay,St.Mary, Jamaica) has only really risen to become popular in the ‘digital’ age of Reggae, although his career stretches back to the 1970’s. Considered by many to be one of Jamaica’s finest contemporary vocalists, his best work has generally been captured on the ‘Penthouse’ and ‘Xterminator’ labels as well as his own ‘Harmony House’ imprint. The singer with his distictive ‘Bourbon on the rocks’ vocal style remains active today both recording and producing.
