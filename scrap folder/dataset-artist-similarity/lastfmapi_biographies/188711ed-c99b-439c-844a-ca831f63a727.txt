Little is known about his personal life.       **Dumile**’s eccentric wordplay makes him a favorite of [underground hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/underground%20hip-hop) fans. He is heavily influenced by American comic books (especially the [Fantastic Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four) and their battles with [Dr. Doom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Doom)). [Japanese](http://www.last.fm/tag/japanese) science fiction is also an influence; the concept for **King Geedorah** (which is derived from [Ghidorah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghidorah)) and the [Monsta Island Czars](http://www.last.fm/music/Monsta+Island+Czars) comes from the [Godzilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla) movie series. He is also renowned for bringing [comedy](http://www.last.fm/tag/comedy) back into the sometimes overly serious world of [rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/rap) lyrics and a unique, sample-heavy production style.      His work with Madvillain has been [covered by the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/04/12/040412crmu_music), as has [his entire career](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/21/090921fa_fact_coates).
