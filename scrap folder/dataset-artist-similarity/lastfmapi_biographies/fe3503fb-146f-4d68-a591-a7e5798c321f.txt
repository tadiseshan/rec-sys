**Afrika Bambaataa** (born April 10 or October 4, 1957 or 1960, though his birthdate is hotly debated; he himself refuses to comment on his age) is a [dj](http://www.last.fm/tag/dj), Hip Hop musician and community leader from the South Bronx, New York, who was instrumental in the early development of [hip hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip%20hop) throughout the 1970s.      During Bambaataa’s early years, he was a founding member of the Bronxdale Projects-area street gang, The Savage Seven. Due to the explosive growth of the gang, it later became known as the Black Spades, and Bambaataa rose to the position of Division Leader. After a life-changing visit to Africa, he changed his name to Afrika Bambaataa Aasim. Bambaataa was influenced by the depiction of the Zulu warriors attacking British troops at Rorke’s Drift in the Michael Caine film Zulu. He took his name, which roughly translated to “affectionate leader”, from the film.      After the visit, Bambaataa decided to use his leadership to turn those involved in the gang life into something more positive to the community. This began the development of The Organization, which soon later became known as the Zulu Nation, a group of racially and politically aware rappers, B-boys, graffiti artists and other people involved in hip hop culture that gained fame in the early eighties to mid nineties. By 1977, inspired by DJ [Kool Herc](http://www.last.fm/music/Kool+Herc), Bambaataa had begun organizing block parties all around the South Bronx, and he was soon renowned as one of the best DJs in the business. In 1980, he produced Soul Sonic Force’s landmark single, “Zulu Nation Throwdown”. In 2000 [Rage Against the Machine](http://www.last.fm/music/Rage+Against+the+Machine) covered Afrika’s song “Renegades Of Funk” for their album “Renegades”. His beats have been sampled by countless other artists.      In 1982, Bambaataa organised the very first European hip hop tour. Along with himself were rapper and graffiti artist [Rammellzee](http://www.last.fm/music/Rammellzee), Zulu Nation DJ [Grand Mixer Dst](http://www.last.fm/music/Grand+Mixer+Dst), B-boy and B-girl crews [The Rock Steady Crew](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rock+Steady+Crew), and the Double Dutch Girls, as well as legendary graffiti artists [Fab 5 Freddy](http://www.last.fm/music/Fab+5+Freddy), [Phase 2](http://www.last.fm/music/Phase+2), [Futura 2000](http://www.last.fm/music/Futura+2000), and [Dondi](http://www.last.fm/music/Dondi).      Also in 1982, Bambaataa became a solo artist (having produced several other singles) and released “Jazzy Sensation” on [Tommy Boy](http://www.last.fm/label/Tommy+Boy) in that year. “Planet Rock”, the most popular 12” single ever, came out that June under the name [Afrika Bambaataa and The Soul Sonic Force](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Afrika+Bambaata a+and+The+Soul+Sonic+Force). The song melded electronic hip hop beats with the main melody from [Kraftwerk](http://www.last
