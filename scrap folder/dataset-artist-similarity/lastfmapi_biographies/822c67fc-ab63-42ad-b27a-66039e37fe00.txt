The Ditty Bops is a band from Los Angeles, California that play a blend of [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk), [bluegrass](http://www.last.fm/tag/bluegrass), [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz), [swing](http://www.last.fm/tag/swing) music, [ragtime](http://www.last.fm/tag/ragtime) and musical theater. They are headed by [Abby DeWald](http://www.last.fm/music/Abby+DeWald) (vocals and acoustic guitar) and [Amanda Barrett](http://www.last.fm/music/Amanda+Barrett) (vocals, mandolin and dulcimer). They are noted for their excellent harmonies and generally playful style and tempo.      The Ditty Bops formed in New York City, when Abby and Amanda were on a hunt for a friendâ€™s lost cat. When they stumbled into the backyard of a stranger, they discovered that he was a musician and an avid guitar collector. He encouraged them to form a band and start playing. So began the Ditty Bops.      Abby and Amanda have been a couple since 1999.      The Ditty Bops appeared with Tori Amos in 2005 while promoting their first eponymous album. Since then they have released a second album, [Moon Over the Freeway](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ditty+Bops/Moon+Over+the+Freeway), and the freshly released [Summer Rains](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ditty+Bops/Summer+Rains)
