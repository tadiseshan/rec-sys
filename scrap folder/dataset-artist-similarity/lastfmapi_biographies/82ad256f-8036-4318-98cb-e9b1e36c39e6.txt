Roy Buchanan’s (September 23, 1939 - August 14, 1988) musical career began in Pixley, California. His father was a sharecropper (not a Pentecostal preacher as Buchanan himself had claimed). Buchanan told how his first musical memories were of racially-mixed revival meetings his family would attend. “Gospel,” he recalled, “that’s how I first got into black music”. He in fact drew upon many disparate influences while learning to play his instrument (although he later claimed his aptitude was derived from being “half-wolf”). He initially showed talent on the steel guitar before switching to the standard instrument in the early 50’s.      In 1957, Buchanan made his recording debut, playing the solo on [Dale Hawkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Dale+Hawkins)’ “[My Babe](http://www.last.fm/music/Dale+Hawkins/_/My+Babe)” for Chicago’s Chess Records. Three years later, Buchanan headed north to Canada, where he took charge of the guitar role in [Ronnie Hawkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Ronnie+Hawkins)’ band (a group later to gain fame as [The Band](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band)). The group’s guitar player, [Robbie Robertson](http://www.last.fm/music/Robbie+Robertson), studied guitar under Buchanan, and took over the lead guitar spot when Buchanan left the group.      The early 60’s found Buchanan performing numerous gigs as a sideman with multiple rock bands, and cutting a number of sessions as guitarist with musicians such as [Freddy Cannon](http://www.last.fm/music/Freddy+Cannon) and [Merle Kilgore](http://www.last.fm/music/Merle+Kilgore).      Buchanan’s 1962 recording with drummer [Bobby Gregg](http://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Gregg), “Potato Peeler”, first introduced the trademark Buchanan pinch harmonics. An effort to cash in on the British Invasion caught Buchanan with [The British Walkers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+British+Walkers). In the mid-‘60’s, Buchanan settled down in the Washington, DC area, playing as a sideman before starting his own groups. One of these groups was called The Snakestretchers, an allusion to Buchanan’s disdain for the vagaries of the band experience. The Snakestretchers became a semi-permanent combo for Buchanan starting in this period, with whom he made his first acclaimed recording as a front man, [Roy Buchanan & the Snakestretchers](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Buchanan/Roy+Buch anan+&+the+Snakestretchers). [Danny Gatton](http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Gatton) was another respected Telecaster master who lived in Washington, D.C. at that time. Both musicians gained reputations as under-appreciated guitarists.      In 1971, riding on word-of-mouth reputation that included praise from [John Lennon](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon), [Eric Clapton](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton), [Merle Haggard](http://www.last.fm/music/Merle+Haggard), and an alleged invitation to join [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last
