Damien Rice (born December 7, 1973) is an [Irish](http://www.last.fm/tag/Irish) [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter). He was born in Dublin, Ireland, to George and Maureen Rice and was raised in Celbridge, County Kildare, Ireland. In March 1999 Damien moved to Tuscany, then travelled around Europe, busking the streets. He arrived back in Dublin a year later, with a clear head and full of ideas. Damien started playing and recording music with his first band, [Juniper](http://www.last.fm/music/Juniper). After a few years he decided creatively it was not for him so he left the band (Newly named [Bell X1](http://www.last.fm/music/Bell+X1)) to start a solo career.      He approached his music with a new found freshness and decided to put some songs down on record. His grandmother told him he had a distant cousin in London in the music business. Borrowing money from those that would lend it, he recorded his demo and sent it off to his cousin, renowned producer and film composer, [David Arnold](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Arnold) ([Bjork](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bjork), James Bond). Arnold liked what he heard and provided enough money for Damien to buy his own mobile studio.      Damien Rice formerly sang with [Lisa Hannigan](http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Hannigan) and released his debut solo album, [O](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Rice/O), in Ireland in early 2002. In July 2002 _[O](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Rice/O)_ was released in the UK and it received widespread critical acclaim. In June 2003 _O_ was released in the USA and Europe, with Rice appearing on The Letterman Show and receiving more acclaim from publications such as Rolling Stone, Newsweek and The Boston Globe. Arnold joined him on stage in New York to perform a version of the Björk/Arnold track Play Dead.   He gained further popularity after some of his most famous songs were included in the media. An example of this is [9 Crimes](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Rice/_/9+Crimes) used in the soundtrack of the summer blockbuster Shrek Three and [The Blower’s Daughter](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Rice/_/The+Blower%27s+Daughter) was featured in the movie Closer. [Delicate](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Rice/_/Delicate) was also featured in the hit T.V. show Lost.      Damien Rice is an intense live act - with emphasis laid on emotional intensity and experiments, rather than technical perfection. At a 2005 concert, for instance, he threw out big cheeses to the audience. This can sometimes be more demanding for the listener than the radio hit edit of the song [Cannonball](http://www.last.fm/music/Damien+Rice/_/Cannonball) suggests. ‘Cannonball’ was re-mixed in 2004, for UK radio, to make it more radio- friendly. Rice later was reported to be very unhappy with it, saying to Tom Dunne on PetSounds (Today FM) that he did not “…really like it”
