**Robert Michael Nesmith** (born December 30, 1942) is an American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) and musician, perhaps best known as a member of [The Monkees](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Monkees). A pioneer of [country rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/country%20rock), Nesmith notably composed “[Different Drum](http://www.last.fm/music/Linda+Ronstadt/_/Different+Drum)”, a hit for [Linda Ronstadt](http://www.last.fm/music/Linda+Ronstadt) (by way of [The Stone Poneys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Poneys)). In 1981, Nesmith won the inaugural Grammy Award for Video of the Year for _[Elephant Parts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_Parts)_, a “video record” consisting of humorous sketches and visual representations of songs, breaking new ground for the concept of music videos, which would shortly become ubiquitous with the advent of MTV.      **Biography**   Born in Houston, Texas, Nesmith was an only child, and his parents, Warren Audrey Nesmith and Bette Nesmith Graham, separated when he was very young. With his father gone, Nesmith’s mother worked as a secretary. Their fortunes changed when Bette invented typewriter correction fluid, later known commercially as Liquid Paper.      Nesmith was an indifferent student, and in his teen years an occasional prankster. An urban legend says a prank with a firecracker went wrong, leaving Nesmith with a hand injury, and that a doctor suggested he learn to play guitar to recover his dexterity (the incident never actually happened). An early accident with a hammer smashed the ring finger on Nesmith’s right hand, and he did not learn to play guitar until his twenties. He did, however, participate in choral and drama activities during his years at Thomas Jefferson High School in Dallas. He also began to write verse poetry.      In 1962, Nesmith’s mother married Robert Graham, triggering a rebellious phase for Nesmith. He took the family car without permission and drove to California. Upon his return, he discovered that his mother had enlisted him in the U.S. Air Force. Nesmith was stationed at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, Texas and he later claimed that he had been discharged after he tipped over a general’s airplane while washing it.      After leaving the Air Force, Nesmith obtained a G.E.D. and then moved in with an uncle, Chick Adair. Nesmith enrolled in San Antonio College, where he met John Kuehne (later to be known as John London) and began a musical collaboration. He also met 16-year-old Phyllis Ann Barbour, whom he later married.      During this time John Kuehne decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career, and Nesmith decided to follow him. Nesmith and Barbour moved back and forth from Texas. Nesmith landed a role in the Monkees pilot, which was filmed in October 1965
