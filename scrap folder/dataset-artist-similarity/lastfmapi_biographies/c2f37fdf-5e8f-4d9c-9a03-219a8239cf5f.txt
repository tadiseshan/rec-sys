Percy Sledge (born 25 November 1941 in Leighton, Alabama) is a US-American R&B and [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) performer.      Percy Sledge worked in the fields in Leighton before he worked as an orderly at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield. By the mid-1960s, Sledge was touring the Southeast with the Esquires Combo on weekends and working at the hospital. A former patient who was a friend of producer Quin Ivy introduced the two, an audition followed, and Sledge was signed to a recording contract.      Sledge’s smooth voice was perfect for the series of soul ballads produced by Ivy and [Marlin Greene](http://www.last.fm/music/Marlin+Greene), which rock critic Dave Marsh called “emotional classics for romantics of all ages.”      “[When A Man Loves A Woman](http://www.last.fm/music/Percy+Sledge/_/When+A+Man+Loves+A+Woman)” was the first song recorded under the contract (released in 1966), and it became not only an international hit (it reached #1 in the US) but was also the first gold record released by [Atlantic Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Atlantic+Records). The magnificent soul anthem became the cornerstone of Sledge’s career and was followed by “[Warm And Tender Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Percy+Sledge/_/Warm+And+Tender+Love),” “[Take Time To Know Her](http://www.last.fm/music/Percy+Sledge/_/Take+Time+To+Know+Her),” and “[Cover Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Percy+Sledge/_/Cover+Me).”      Sledge charted with “[I’ll Be Your Everything](http://www.last.fm/music/Percy+ Sledge/_/I%27ll+Be+Your+Everything)” and “[Sunshine](http://www.last.fm/music/Percy+Sledge/_/Sunshine)” during the 1970s, and has become an international concert favorite throughout the world, especially in the [Netherlands](http://www.last.fm/place/Netherlands), [Germany](http://www.last.fm/place/Germany), and on the African continent.      His career enjoyed a renaissance in the 1980s when “When a Man Loves a Woman” re-entered the Top 10 in the UK after being used in a Levi’s commercial.      Sledge was an inaugural Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Award honoree in 1989. In 2005, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
