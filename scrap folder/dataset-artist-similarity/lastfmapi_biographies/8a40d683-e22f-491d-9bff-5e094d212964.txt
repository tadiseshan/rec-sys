James Cotton (born July 1, 1935, Tunica, Mississippi, United States) is an American blues harmonica player, singer and songwriter, who has performed and recorded with many of the great blues artists of his time as well as with his own band. Although he played drums early in his career, Cotton is famous for his work on the harmonica. Cotton began his professional career playing the blues harp in Howlin’ Wolf’s band in the early 1950s. In 1965 he formed the Jimmy Cotton Blues Quartet, utilizing Otis Spann on piano to record between gigs with Muddy Waters’ band. In the 1970s, Cotton played harmonica on Muddy Waters’ Grammy Award winning 1977 album Hard Again.      “The blues is all about feeling,” says Grammy Award-winning harmonica legend James “Mr. Superharp” Cotton. “If I don’t feel it, I can’t play it.” Now in his 69th year as a professional musician (starting at age nine), **[James Cotton](http://www.last.fm/music/James+Cotton)** not only feels it, he lives it. His overwhelmingly powerful harmonica is one of the iconic sounds of the blues. His skills are unrivaled, his story the stuff of legend. Born on a cotton plantation in Tunica, Mississippi on July 1, 1935, Cotton learned harmonica directly from [Sonny Boy Williamson II](http://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+Boy+Williamson+II) (Rice Miller) as a small child. He toured with Williamson and [Howlin’ Wolf](http://www.last.fm/music/Howlin%E2%80%99+Wolf), recorded for Sun Records, and spent 12 years with [Muddy Waters](http://www.last.fm/music/Muddy+Waters) before stepping out on his own. Leading his own band, he earned his reputation as one of the most commanding live blues performers in the world—a man who could literally suck the reeds out of his harmonica from the pure force of his playing—one high-energy performance at a time.      His new Alligator album, **_Cotton Mouth Man_**, is a joyous celebration of his life in the blues. Recorded in Nashville and produced by Grammy-winning producer/songwriter/drummer Tom Hambridge ([Buddy Guy](http://www.last.fm/music/Buddy+Guy), [Joe Louis Walker](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Louis+Walker), [Susan Tedeschi](http://www.last.fm/music/Susan+Tedeschi)), the album is a riveting, good-time musical journey through sounds and scenes from Cotton’s long and storied career. With seven songs co-written by Cotton (more originals than he’s ever included on one release) and Hambridge (who co-wrote five additional tracks), the stories the album tells are Cotton’s own, inspired by his colorful and sometimes perilous life. Throughout the CD Cotton’s blast-furnace harmonica sound and larger-than-life personality are front and center.
