Max Romeo (born Maxwell Livingston Smith, 22 November 1947, St. D’Acre, St. Ann, Jamaica), is a reggae and roots reggae recording artist who has achieved chart success in his home country, and in the UK. The singer who put the rude in rude boy, Max Romeo was responsible for launching an entirely new sub-genre of reggae, whose overtly suggestive lyrics caused an outcry but took a massive hold of the music scene regardless. Yet innuendo was the least of the singer’s stylings, previous to the release of his infamous “Wet Dream,” Romeo had garnered a string of sweet hits with the vocal trio the Emotions. And once the nocturnal naughtiness faded, the singer established himself as one of the most important figures in the roots scene.   He left home at the age of 14 and worked on a sugar plantation outside Clarendon, cleaning out irrigation ditches, before winning a local talent competition when he was 18; prompting a move to the capital, Kingston, in order to achieve a successful musical career.      In 1965 he joined up with Kenneth Knight and Lloyd Shakespeare in [The Emotions](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Emotions), whilst also working as a record plugger for Ken Lack’s Caltone label. The group were unsuccessful in auditions for other producers, but Lack offered them an audition after overhearing Smith singing to himself as he worked one day. In 1966, the group had their first hit, with the Lack-produced, “[Buy You a Rainbow](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Emotions/_/Buy+You+a+Rainbow)”. [The Emotions](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Emotions) went on to have several hit singles and by 1968, the singer, by this point known as Max Romeo, felt confident enough to launch a solo career. Working with producer Bunny Lee, the young star recorded a number of pop songs, mainly love ballads, but they failed to be popular and so he returned to The Emotions, now recording for Phil Pratt. During this time he began work as a sales representative for Bunny Lee and did some recording with [The Hippy Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Hippy+Boys), which would later became [The Upsetters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Upsetters).      Later on in 1968, Romeo wrote new lyrics for the rhythm track of [Derrick Morgan](http://www.last.fm/music/Derrick+Morgan)’s “[Hold You Jack](http://www.last.fm/music/Derrick+Morgan/_/Hold+You+Jack)” and handed them over to Lee. Morgan, who was due to add his vocals to the track, ultimately gave it a miss, as did several other vocalists (including [John Holt](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Holt) and [Slim Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/Slim+Smith)), leading the producer to turn to Romeo to sing the lyrics he had written. The result, “[Wet Dream](http://www.last.fm/music/Max+Romeo/_/Wet+Dream)”, was an instant hit in Jamaica, although in the UK it was met with a BBC Radio ban, despite Romeo’s somewhat-disingenuous claim that the song was actually about a roof that has a leak
