Christy Moore, a native of Co. Kildare, Ireland, found fame as a member of the legendary tradition folk band [Planxty](http://www.last.fm/music/Planxty). Since then he has carved out his own career as a consummate solo performer. In the 1980s Christy teamed up with [Donal Lunny](http://www.last.fm/music/Donal+Lunny) to form the innovative [Moving Hearts](http://www.last.fm/music/Moving+Hearts).      Christy Moore started in the music business in the mid-sixties, when his life as a bank clerk was interrupted by a bank strike, and he moved to England. There he became involved in the folk music scene at the time, and spent a few years playing pubs and clubs around the country.      His return to Ireland was marked by the album ‘Prosperous’, which proved to be a milestone in the rapprochement of Irish music to the popular mainstream. This album benefited from a collaboration of the leading talents of contemporary folk music, musicians such as [Andy Irvine](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Irvine), [Donal Lunny](http://www.last.fm/music/Donal+Lunny) and [Liam O’Flynn](http://www.last.fm/music/Liam+O%27Flynn), and this one-off was to lead to the formation of [Planxty](http://www.last.fm/music/Planxty), a band who were soon to be at the leading edge of the revival of Irish traditional music.      Over the following years the musical status of [Planxty](http://www.last.fm/music/Planxty) became legendary both in Ireland, Britain and throughout Europe. However in 1974 the band split up to pursue solo projects. It was during this period that Christy continued to explore new ground as a solo artist recording a number of solo albums including ‘The Iron Behind the Velvet’ (TARACD2002) which featured [Andy Irvine](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Irvine) and ‘Live in Dublin’ (TARACD2005) with [Donal Lunny](http://www.last.fm/music/Donal+Lunny).      The original [Planxty](http://www.last.fm/music/Planxty) lineup of Christy, Andy, Liam and Donal then reformed in 1979. They recorded two further albums with Tara Records ‘After the Break’ (TARACD3001) and ‘The Woman I Loved So Well’ (TARACD3005). There were several additions and changes to their lineup most notably the addition of [Matt Molloy](http://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Molloy), flautist from [The Bothy Band](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bothy+Band), who later joined [The Chieftains](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chieftains), and [Bill Whelan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Whelan).      In 1981 [Planxty](http://www.last.fm/music/Planxty) performed a [Bill Whelan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Whelan) arrangement called ‘Timedance’ as the intermission piece for the Eurovision song contest, held that year in Ireland. Later it was released as a single and is now included on Bill’s CD of ‘The Seville Suite’ (TARACD3030) released by Tara in 1992.      In the eighties Christy again teamed up with [Donal Lunny](http://www.last.fm/music/Donal+Lunny) to form [Moving Hearts](http://www.last
