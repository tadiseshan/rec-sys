Annette Hanshaw (October 18, 1901 - March 13, 1985) was one of the first great female [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) singers. In the late 1920s she ranked alongside [Ethel Waters](http://www.last.fm/music/Ethel+Waters), [Bessie Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/Bessie+Smith) and [The Boswell Sisters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Boswell+Sisters).      Her singing style was relaxed and suited the new jazz-influenced pop music of the late 19[20s](http://www.last.fm/tag/20s). Although she had a low opinion of her own singing, she continues to have fans because of how she combined the voice of an ingenue with the spirit of a flapper.      Hanshaw made her one and only appearance on film[1] in the 1933 Paramount short Captain Henry’s Radio Show, “a picturization” of the popular Thursday evening radio program Maxwell House Show Boat, in which she starred from 1932 to 1934.      Having grown tired of show business, in the late 1930s Hanshaw retired and settled into married life with her husband, Pathé Records executive Herman “Wally” Rose. Later in life, in a would-be comeback, she recorded two demo records, but they were never released.      **Birthdate**   For many years it was believed that Annette had been born in 1910 and began her recording career shortly before her 16th birthday. However, it has recently come to light that she was in fact born nine years earlier, making her 24 at the time of her first commercial recording in September 1926. Her nephew, Frank W. Hanshaw III, has confirmed 1901 as the date on her birth certificate.
