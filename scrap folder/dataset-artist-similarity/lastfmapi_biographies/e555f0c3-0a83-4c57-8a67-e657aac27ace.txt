Il Divo, Italian for “divine male performer,” is an international operatic pop vocal group under the [Sony BMG](http://www.last.fm/label/Sony+BMG) music label. Il Divo is formed by singers David Miller, Sébastien Izambard, Urs Bühler, and Carlos Marín.      The idea behind this quartet’s creation came to [Simon Cowell](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Cowell) after listening to [Andrea Bocelli](http://www.last.fm/music/Andrea+Bocelli) and [Sarah Brightman](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Brightman)’s rendition of “[Con Te Partirò](http://www.last.fm/music/Andrea+Bocelli/_/Con+Te+Partir%C3%B2).” He realized he loved lyrical voices but not opera, so he decided to form a multinational quartet ([France](http://www.last.fm/place/France), [Switzerland](http://www.last.fm/place/Switzerland), [Spain](http://www.last.fm/place/Spain), and [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States)) that sounded like [The Three Tenors](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Three+Tenors) but sang pop songs and looked like handsome Armani models.      With this idea, Cowell commenced a worldwide search for young singers who were willing to embark on the Il Divo project. His search lasted two years, from 2001 until December 2003, when the fourth member of Il Divo, American tenor David Miller, was signed. The well-established formation of Il Divo comprises a renowned Spanish opera and zarzuela baritone, Carlos Marín, a French pop singer, Sébastien Izambard, and two classically trained tenors, Swiss Urs Bühler and American David Miller. Recording of their first album started in the first half of 2004 in [Sweden](http://www.last.fm/place/Sweden).      The group’s debut album, the self-named _[Il Divo](http://www.last.fm/music/Il+Divo/Il+Divo)_, contains renditions of [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra)’s hit “[My Way (A Mi Manera)](http://www.last.fm/music/Il+Divo/_/My+Way+\(A+Mi+Manera\)),” [Toni Braxton](http://www.last.fm/music/Toni+Braxton)’s hit “[Unbreak My Heart (Regresa A Mi)](http://www.last.fm/music/Il+Divo/_/Unbreak+My+Heart+\(Regresa+A+Mi\)),” an adaptation of [Ennio Morricone](http://www.last.fm/music/Ennio+Morricone)’s soundtrack titled “[Gabriel’s Oboe](http://www.last.fm/music/Ennio+Morricone/_/Gabriel%27s+Oboe)” from the movie _La Misión_ titled “[Nella Fantasia](http://www.last.fm/music/Il+Divo/_/Nella+Fantasia)” and several songs sung in Spanish, English, Italian, and Portuguese (“[Volta Pra Mim](http://www.last.fm/music/Il+Divo/_/Volta+Pra+Mim)”), including 1994’s San Remo Festival winner “[Passerà](http://www.last.fm/music/Il+Divo/_/Passer%C3%A0).”      Il Divo hit the #1 slot on both Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com after a breakout career-defining appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show on April 5, 2005, where the quartet performed its interpretation of “Unbreak My Heart.”      In the [United Kingdom](http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom), the _Il Divo_ album topped [Robbie Williams](http://www.last
