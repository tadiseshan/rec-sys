Boogie Down Productions was originally composed of [KRS- One](http://www.last.fm/music/KRS-One), [D-Nice](http://www.last.fm/music/D-Nice), and DJ Scott La Rock. The latter was murdered on August 27, 1987, after the release of BDP’s debut album Criminal Minded. The name of the group, “Boogie Down”, derives from the alternative name for The Bronx section of New York City.      While Criminal Minded was basically about sex and crime, BDP radically changed after Scott’s death, becoming the most popular conscious rap group besides Public Enemy. Boogie Down Productions pioneered the fusion of Raggamuffin and hip hop music.      The membership of BDP changed continuously throughout its existence, the only constant being KRS-One. BDP members and collaborators included Kenny Parker (KRS’ brother), Run, Keith Murray, McBoo, Ms. Melodie, Scottie Morris, Willie D., Robocop, Harmony, DJ Red Alert, DJ Jazzy Jay Kramer, D-Square, Rebekah, and Sidney Mills. BDP as group essentially ended because KRS-One began recording and performing under his own name, rather than the group name.
