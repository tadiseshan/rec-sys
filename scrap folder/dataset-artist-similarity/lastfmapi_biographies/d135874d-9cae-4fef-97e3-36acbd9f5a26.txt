Patricia Lee **”Patti” Smith** (born December 30, 1946) is an American singer, poet and visual artist who was a highly influential component of the New York [punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk) rock movement, particularly with her 1975 début album ‘_[Horses](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+Smith/Horses)_’. Called the “Godmother of Punk”, she integrated the beat [poetry](http://www.last.fm/tag/poetry) performance style with three-chord rock. Smith’s most widely known song is “[Because the Night](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+Smith/_/Because+the+Night)”, which was co-written with [Bruce Springsteen](http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen) and reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1978. In 2007, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.      Smith was born in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Her mother, Beverly, was a jazz singer, and father, Grant, worked at the Honeywell plant. She spent her entire childhood in Deptford, New Jersey. Raised the daughter of a Jehovah’s Witness mother, she claims she had a strong religious, Bible-based education but left organized religion as a teenager because she felt it was too confining. (She later wrote the opening line of her cover version of Them’s [Gloria](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+Smith/_/Gloria) in response to this experience.) After graduating from Deptford Township High School in 1964, Smith went to work in a factory.      In 1967 she left Glassboro State Teachers College (now Rowan University) and moved to New York City. She met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe there while working at a book store with friend, poet Janet Hamill. Mapplethorpe’s photographs of her became the covers for the [Patti Smith Group](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Patti+Smith+Group) LPs, and they remained friends until Mapplethorpe’s death in 1989. In 1969 she went to Paris with her sister and started busking and doing performance art. When Smith returned to New York City, she lived in the Hotel Chelsea with Mapplethorpe. The two frequented the fashionable Max’s Kansas City and CBGB nightclubs. The same year Smith appeared with Wayne County in Jackie Curtis’s play “Femme Fatale”. As a member of the St. Mark’s Poetry Project, she spent the early ’70s painting, writing, and performing. In 1971 she performed – for one night only – in Sam Shepard’s “Cowboy Mouth”. (The published play’s notes call for “a man who looks like a coyote and a woman who looks like a crow”.) She collaborated with Allen Lanier of [Blue Öyster Cult](http://www.last.fm/music/Blue+%C3%96yster+Cult), who recorded several of the songs to which Smith had contributed, including Debbie Denise (after her poem “In Remembrance of Debbie Denise”), Career of Evil, Fire of Unknown Origin, [The Revenge Of Vera Gemini](http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+Smith/_/The+Revenge+Of+Vera+Gemini), and Shooting Shark. During these years, Smith also wrote rock journalism, some of which was published in Creem magazine
