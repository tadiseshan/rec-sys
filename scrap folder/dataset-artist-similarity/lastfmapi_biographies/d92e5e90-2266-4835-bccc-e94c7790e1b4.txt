Claudine Georgette Longet (born January 29, 1942 in Paris), was a popular singer and recording artist in the 19[60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s) and 19[70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s). She was best known as the ex-wife of singer [Andy Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Williams) and later for being convicted of “misdemeanor negligent homicide” in the death of skiing star Spider Sabich.      She was a dancer at the Folies Bergere in Las Vegas. and met Andy Williams when he pulled over to aid her on a desert road. They married on Christmas Day 1961 and had three children, Noelle, Christian and Robert. In 1968, she appeared in “The Party” with [Peter Sellers](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Sellers) and sang “[Nothing To Lose](http://www.last.fm/music/Claudine+Longet/_/Nothing+To+Lose)” by [Henry Mancini](http://www.last.fm/music/Henry+Mancini). Longet recorded a series of five MOR albums for A&M Records between 1966 and 1970 and two albums for Williams’s [Barnaby](http://www.last.fm/label/Barnaby) label in 1971 and 1972. She also made frequent acting appearances in television series and appeared from time to time on Williams’ variety series and specials. Williams called Longet a beautiful, sleek brunette with large doe eyes, “my favorite French singer”. She and Williams separated in 1969 but did not divorce until 6 years later.      Longet has never performed again after the criminal trial, and the Sabich family initiated civil proceedings to sue Longet. The case was eventually settled out of court for a large monetary settlement, with the proviso that Longet never tell or write about her story. They also demanded that Claudine withdraw from public circulation her recording of “Bang Bang, My Baby Shot Me Down.”
