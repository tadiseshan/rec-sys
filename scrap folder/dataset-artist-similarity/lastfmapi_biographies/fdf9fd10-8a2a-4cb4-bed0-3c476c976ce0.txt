Rachael Yamagata (born on September 23, 1977 in Arlington, Virginia) is a [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter). She plays piano and acoustic guitar, and her dark, smokey [alto](http://www.last.fm/tag/alto) garners frequent comparisons to [Fiona Apple](http://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple). Her first full-length album, [Happenstance](http://www.last.fm/music/Rachael+Yamagata/Happenstance), was released on June 8, 2004.      Yamagata became the vocalist for the Chicago funk-fusion band [Bumpus](http://www.last.fm/music/Bumpus), spending six years with them while writing and recording three albums and touring the country. However, she began to write songs which took on a style that conflicted with the funk vision of the band. In 2001, Yamagata decided to take those songs and pursue a solo career. In September 2002, she landed a two-record deal with Arista’s Private Music label, and her [EP](http://www.last.fm/music/Rachael+Yamagata/EP) was released in October.      She also made an appearance in [Jason Mraz](http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Mraz)’s second album, singing a song with him called [Did You Get My Message?](http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Mraz/_/Did+You+Get+My+Message%3F)      She also teamed with with [Toots & The Maytals](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Toots+&+The+Maytals) to sing [Blame On Me](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Toots+&+The+Maytals/_/Blame+On+Me).      She also worked with [Ryan Adams & The Cardinals](http://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Adams+&+The+Cardinals) on their first album Cold Roses. On that album, where she is credited as: “Our little sis”, she did some vocals and played “listenable” piano on the tracks ‘Let It Ride’, ‘Cold Roses’ and ‘Friends’.      Yamagata sang with [Rhett Miller](http://www.last.fm/music/Rhett+Miller) on [Fireflies](http://www.last.fm/music/Rhett+Miller/_/Fireflies) from his 2006 release The Believer.      Her songs have featured on several TV shows, including How I Met Your Mother, ER , Nip/Tuck, Men in Trees, Alias, One Tree Hill, Brothers & Sisters and The O.C., to which she made a guest performance in season 2.

She also toured with Moore, opening many of her shows around the country.
