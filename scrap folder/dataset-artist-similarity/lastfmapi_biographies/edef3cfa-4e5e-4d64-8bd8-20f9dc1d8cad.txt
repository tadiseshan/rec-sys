Tiken Jah Fakoly (1968) is a reggae singer from Odienné, Côte d’Ivoire (a.k.a Ivory Coast).      Tiken Jah was born into a family of griots and christened Doumbia Moussa Fakoly on June 23, 1968 in Odienne, north-western Côte d’Ivoire. He discovered reggae at an early age, assembling his first group, Djelys, in 1987. He became well-known at a regional level, but would soon ascend to national recognition.      Concerned by the social and political evolution of his country, it was not long before Tiken Jah was writing incisive works on the political environment in Côte d’Ivoire. One such work was on the death of Felix Houphouet-Boigny in 1993, which resulted in a surge of popularity amongst the nation’s youth. In 1998, Fakoly made his first international appearance in Paris.      Tiken Jah Fakoly plays music “to wake up the consciences”. His music speaks about many injustices done to the people of his country, and those over Africa. As such, African listeners feel a deep affinity with his lyrics as Fakoly speaks for people whom are under oppression. This connection has helped make Tiken Jah Fakoly a much-listened artist throughout both Europe and Africa.      **Discography**      1\. 1993: Les Djelys (cassette only - discontinued)   2\. 1994: Missiri (cassette only - discontinued)   3\. 1996: Mangercratie   4\. 1999: Cours d’histoire   5\. 2000: Le Cameleon (exclusive to West Africa)   6\. 2002: Françafrique (a term coined by Francois Xavier-Verschave)   7\. 2004: Coup de gueule   8\. 2005: Africa wants to be free, compilation to support fr:Survie (association)      NOTE: Mangercratie was released in France in 1999 and in Canada in 2000.
