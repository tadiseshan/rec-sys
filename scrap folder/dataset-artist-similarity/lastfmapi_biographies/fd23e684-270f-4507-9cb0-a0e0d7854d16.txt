Biography      [edit] Early life   Connick, Jr. was born Joseph Harry Fowler Connick, Jr.[1] in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Anita, a judge, lawyer, and former Louisiana Supreme Court justice, and Harry Connick, Sr., who was the district attorney of New Orleans from 1977-2003, successfully running against Jim Garrison.[2] His parents also owned a record store. Connick, Jr.’s mother, a native of New York City, was Jewish, and his father is of Irish Catholic background.[3][4] Connick, Jr. has a sister, Suzanna. He was raised in the Lakeview neighbourhood of New Orleans.Connick’s musical talents soon came to the fore when he learned the keyboards at the age of three, played publicly at age six and recorded with a local jazz band at 10. His musical talents were developed at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and under the tutelage of Ellis Marsalis and James Booker.      Connick attended Jesuit High School and Isidore Newman School in New Orleans. He moved to New York City to study at Hunter College and the prestigious Manhattan School of Music, where a Columbia Records executive persuaded him to sign with that label. His first record for the label, Harry Connick Jr., was a mainly instrumental album of standards. He soon acquired a reputation in jazz because of extended stays at high-profile New York venues. His next album, 20, featured his vocals and added to this reputation.         [edit] When Harry Met Sally… — chart and movie success   With Connick’s growing reputation, director Rob Reiner asked him to provide a soundtrack for his 1989 romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally…, starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal. The soundtrack consisted of several standards, including “It Had to Be You”, “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off” and “Don’t Get Around Much Anymore”, and achieved double-platinum status in the United States. He won his {HE'S GAY! THIS IS BULLSHIT K? K. I HATE HARRY CONNICK JR!} first Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance for his work on the soundtrack.      Connick made his screen debut in Memphis Belle (1990), about a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber crew in World War II. In that year, he began a two-year world tour. In addition, he released two albums in July 1990: the instrumental jazz trio album Lofty’s Roach Souffle and a big-band album of mostly original songs titled We Are in Love, which also went double platinum. We Are in Love earned him his second consecutive Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal.      “Promise Me You’ll Remember”, his contribution to the Godfather III soundtrack, was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe in 1991
