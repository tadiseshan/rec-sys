Betty Carter (1929–1998) was a prominent U.S. jazz singer, renowned for her improvisational technique and idiosyncratic vocal style. Carter expanded the role of the vocalist in jazz, to a full, improvising member of the band. Although her voice was not as admired by the public as such vocalists as [Sarah Vaughan](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Vaughan) or [Ella Fitzgerald](http://www.last.fm/music/Ella+Fitzgerald), many consider her to have exercised mastery of the human voice previously unheard in jazz. [Carmen McRae](http://www.last.fm/music/Carmen+McRae) once claimed that “there’s really only one jazz singer - only one: Betty Carter.”      Carter was born Lillie Mae Jones on 16th May 1929 in Flint, Michigan and grew up in Detroit, where her father led a church choir. She studied piano at the Detroit Conservatory. She won a talent contest and became a regular on the local club circuit, singing and playing piano. When she was sixteen, she sang with [Charlie Parker](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker). She later performed with [Dizzy Gillespie](http://www.last.fm/music/Dizzy+Gillespie) and [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis) and toured with [Lionel Hampton](http://www.last.fm/music/Lionel+Hampton) (from whom she received the nickname “Betty Bebop”), when she perfected her scat singing of bebop.      Her career was eclipsed somewhat during the 1960s and 1970s, though a series of duets with [Ray Charles](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles) in 1961, including the R&B-chart-topping “Baby, It’s Cold Outside”, brought her a measure of popular recognition. She recorded for various labels during this period, including Peacock, ABC-Paramount, and Atco, but was rarely satisfied with the resulting product. An episode in which a record company A&R man tried to abscond with a set of her master recordings led her to establish her own record label, Bet-Car, in 1970. Some of her most outstanding recordings were first issued on Bet-Car, including the double album _The Audience with Betty Carter_ (1980). She was well-received at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1977 and 1978. In 1987 Carter signed with Verve Records. She won a Grammy in 1988 for her album _Look What I Got!_ and sang in a guest appearance on The Cosby Show in that year.      She died on 26th September 1998.
