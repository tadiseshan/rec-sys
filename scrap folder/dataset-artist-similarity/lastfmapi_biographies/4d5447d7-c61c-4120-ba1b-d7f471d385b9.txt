**John Winston Ono Lennon** (9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English musician, singer, [songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/songwriter), and peace activist, born in Liverpool, UK who gained worldwide fame as a founding member of [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles). With [Paul McCartney](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney), **Lennon** formed one of the most influential and successful songwriting partnerships of the 20th century and “wrote some of the most popular music in [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll) history”. He is ranked the second most successful songwriter in UK singles chart history after [Paul McCartney](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney).       **Lennon** revealed a rebellious nature, and biting wit, in his music, on film, in books, and at press conferences and interviews. He was controversial through his work as a peace activist and artist. After [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles), **Lennon** enjoyed a successful solo career (that started in 1968, 2 years before the break-up of [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles)) with such acclaimed albums as **John Lennon**/[Plastic Ono Band](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/Plastic+Ono+Band) and [Imagine](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/Imagine) and iconic songs such as “[Give Peace a Chance](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/Give+Peace+a+Chance)” and “[Imagine](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/Imagine)”. After a self-imposed “retirement” to raise his son, **Lennon** reemerged with a comeback album, [Double Fantasy](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/Double+Fantasy), but was murdered less than one month after its release. The album would go on to win the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.      As of 2012, Lennon’s solo album sales in the United States exceeded 14 million and, as writer, co-writer or performer, he is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart. In 2002, a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth and, in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth- greatest singer of all time. He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.      He is the father of [Julian Lennon](http://www.last.fm/music/Julian+Lennon) and [Sean Lennon](http://www.last.fm/music/Sean+Lennon).
