Anna Nalick (born March 30, 1984, in Temple City, California) is an American platinum-selling singer and songwriter. In addition to writing all of her own music, Nalick has been writing for other artists since the age of 15.      Starting in 2003, Nalick released her first studio produced album, entitled: “Wreck of the Day” in 2005. It featured the hit single “Breathe (2AM)” under the SonyMusic label. The song propelled to the top of the charts and sent Anna on a nearly four year tour around the world. Featuring her third hit single “Shine,” Nalick and SonyMusic released “The Shine EP.” Both “Wreck of the Day” and “The Shine EP” can still be heard widely on radio and television today, with “Breathe” being featured twice on the hit television drama “Grey’s Anatomy.”      Wanting to pursue a musical style free of label influence, Nalick decided to part ways with SonyMusic in 2010 and in 2011, released her first independently produced album: “Broken Doll & Odds & Ends”. Nalick describes the album as: “mostly acoustic with haunting and unusual instrumentation. I wanted to release the songs I wrote while I was with Sony before I move on to all new material. I liked the songs too much to just leave them all behind. Now I’m ready to explore new territory.”      Utilizing the unique sounds of toy piano, sitar, glockenspiel, oud, mandocello and sweeping string arrangements, “Broken Doll & Odds & Ends” features a wide range of instruments, performed by a very talented collection of musicians. Nalick’s unique storytelling ability and timeless sense of melody has gained even more notoriety with fans, selling over 30,000 copies during the album’s first month.      Presently, Nalick is dedicating the majority of her time to writing for her next project. Unlike the acoustic feel of “Broken Doll & Odds & Ends,” Nalick’s next album is planned to be an electric collection of songs, featuring a full band and a bigger sound than previously produced.
