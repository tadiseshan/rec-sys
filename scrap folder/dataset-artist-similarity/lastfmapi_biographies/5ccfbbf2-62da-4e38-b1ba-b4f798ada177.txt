Rock ‘n’ Roll ain’t pretty and neither is Scott H. Biram. The self proclaimed “Dirty Old One Man Band” successfully, and sometimes violently, lashes together blues, hillbilly and country precariously to raucous punk and godless metal.      Biram ain’t no dour ass singer/songwriter either, sweetly strumming songs about girls with big eyes and dusty highways. HELL NO!!! His singing, yodeling, growling, leering and brash preachin’ and hollerin’ is accompanied by sloppy riffs and licks from his 1959 Gibson guitar and pounding backbeat brought forth by his amplified left foot. The remainder of this one-man band consists of an unwieldy combination of beat-up amplifiers and old microphones strung together by a tangled mess of guitar cables.      Years of non-stop touring have honed his assault to a fine edge; his wide-eyed throwdowns in the First Church of Ultimate Fanaticism routinely lead giddy followers to a fiery baptism.
