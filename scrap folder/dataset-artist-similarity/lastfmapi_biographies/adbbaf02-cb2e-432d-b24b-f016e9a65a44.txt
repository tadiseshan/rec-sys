Between 1997 and 2001, Sexsmith released three more albums before the acclaimed _[Cobblestone Runway](http://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Sexsmith/Cobblestone+Runway)_ in 2002.      2004’s album, _[Retriever](http://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Sexsmith/Retriever)_, a more [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop)-oriented album than those before, is dedicated to [Elliott Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith) and [Johnny Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash). In 2004 he was invited by Grammy-Award-Winner [Bill Frisell](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Frisell) to perform at the German RuhrTriennale in the renowned concert series Century of Song together with songwriter [Jesse Harris](http://www.last.fm/music/Jesse+Harris).      In 2005, he released a collection of songs recorded with drummer Don Kerr during the production of _[Retriever](http://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Sexsmith/Retriever)_, called _[Destination Unknown](http://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Sexsmith/Destination+Unknown)_. The same year, he also won a Juno Award for songwriter of the year, for the song “[Whatever It Takes](http://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Sexsmith/_/Whatever+It+Takes)”.      His first five albums are generally melancholic [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk)-[pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) with simple, elegant melodies, accentuated use of guitars and economic application of other instruments. On his sixth album, _[Cobblestone Runway](http://www.last.fm/music/Ron+Sexsmith/Cobblestone+Runway)_, producer Martin Terefe changed the style to include a more lavish use of synthesizers. _Retriever_ is considered his most “poppy” album.      With _Time Being_, however, he has proven that he hasn’t forgotten his roots as a folky singer-songwriter.Top songs are Secret Heart (well covered by [Feist](http://www.last.fm/music/Feist)) and Strawberry Blonde(sublime economic evocative narrative lyrics). _Time Being_ was released in 2006 and he’s since released_Exit Strategy For The Soul_ in 2008.
