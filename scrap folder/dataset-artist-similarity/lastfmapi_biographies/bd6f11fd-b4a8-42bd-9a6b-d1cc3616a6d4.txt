Sadat X (born Derek Murphy; December 29, 1968 is an American rapper, most famed as a member of hip hop group [Brand Nubian](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian). Originally known as [Derek X](http://www.last.fm/music/Derek+X), Sadat takes his name from former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat. The X is taken from the Nation of Islam practice of members changing their surnames simply to X. He is well known for his unique, high-pitched voice, as well as his Pro-Black, and at times controversial, lyrical content.      Sadat X debuted with Brand Nubian in 1989, with the release of their debut single [Brand Nubian](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian/_/Brand+Nubian) b/w [Feels So Good](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian/_/Feels+So+Good). The group’s debut album, [One for All](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian/One+for+All), was released in late 1990, featuring the singles [All for One](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian/_/All+for+One), [Wake Up](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian/_/Wake+Up) and [Slow Down](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian/_/Slow+Down). The album was widely acclaimed, inspired by the teachings of the Nation of Islam, similar to many groups of the era, including [X-Clan](http://www.last.fm/music/X-Clan), [Public Enemy](http://www.last.fm/music/Public+Enemy) and [Poor Righteous Teachers](http://www.last.fm/music/Poor+Righteous+Teachers). One For All is now considered a classic [hip hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip%20hop) album, and was awarded a 5 Mic rating from popular magazine The Source. Brand Nubian returned in 1993 with the album [In God We Trust](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian/In+God+We+Trust), which featured the hit single [Punks Jump up to Get Beat Down](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian/_/Punks+Jump+up+to+Get+Beat+Down). Sadat received a bit of controversy following the song’s release, due to alleged homophobic content. Following the mixed reviews from the group’s third album, 1994’s [Everything Is Everything](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian/Everything+Is+Everything), Brand Nubian split up to pursue solo endeavors. In 1996, Sadat released his first solo effort, [Wild Cowboys](http://www.last.fm/music/Sadat+X/Wild+Cowboys). The album featured production from [Pete Rock](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Rock), [Da Beatminerz](http://www.last.fm/music/Da+Beatminerz), [Diamond D](http://www.last.fm/music/Diamond+D), [Showbiz](http://www.last.fm/music/Showbiz) and Buckwild, as well as a pair of hit singles, [Hang ‘Em High](http://www.last.fm/music/Sadat+X/_/Hang+%27Em+High) and [The Lump Lump](http://www.last.fm/music/Sadat+X/_/The+Lump+Lump), the former charting on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadat reunited with original Brand Nubian members [Grand Puba](http://www.last.fm/music/Grand+Puba), [Lord Jamar](http://www.last.fm/music/Lord+Jamar) and DJ Alamo for a reunion album, [Foundation](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian/Foundation), released in late 1998
