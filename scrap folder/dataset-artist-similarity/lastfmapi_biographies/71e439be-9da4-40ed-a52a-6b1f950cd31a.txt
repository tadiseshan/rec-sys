Pato Banton is a reggae artist from Birmingham, England who peaked in the early 1990s with the number one hit “Baby Come Back”, a cover of the classic [The Equals](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Equals) song.      He first began recording in 1982 regularly teaming up with [Ranking Roger](http://www.last.fm/music/Ranking+Roger) of [The Beat](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beat) (sometimes referred to outside the UK as [The English Beat](http://www.last.fm/music/The+English+Beat)). Pato also appeared as a guest artist on [UB40](http://www.last.fm/music/UB40)’s 1985 album “Baggariddim”.      His solo debut was 1987’s “Never Give In”. An EP entitled “Visions Of The World” followed in 1988, and in 1990 came “Wize Up (No Compromise)” which featured a cover of [The Police](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Police)’s “Spirits In The Material World”.      Throughout this time, Banton continued to be known only in reggae circles and it was not until 1994’s collaboration with Robin and Ali Campbell of UB40 on “Baby Come Back” that Pato thrust himself into the mainstream. He followed this with a string of hits including “Bubbling Hot” (teaming up with Ranking Roger again), “Groovin”, a re-issue of “Spirits in the material world” and a guest appearance on a remixed and re-released version of [Sting](http://www.last.fm/music/Sting)’s “This Cowboy Song”.      Following his brief period of mainstream success, Pato returned to his reggae roots and has since released 3 more albums. He continues to be much loved and currently tours in America and all over the world.
