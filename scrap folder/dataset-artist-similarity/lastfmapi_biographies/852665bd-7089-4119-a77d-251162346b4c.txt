Kool G Rap (born Nathaniel Wilson July 20, 1968) is an American hardcore rapper from Queens, New York, United States. He began his career with the Juice Crew in the 1980s but achieved little commercial success.      G Rap began working with DJ Polo in 1986, releasing several underground hit singles including “It’s a Demo”/”I’m Fly.” Two other singles, “Streets of New York” and “Road to the Riches,” received heavy rotation on Yo! MTV Raps and cemented his reputation as one of New York’s top lyrical auteurs. His talent for telling a compelling, hard-luck story in a single song was considered second to only that of Rakim. While G Rap grew in popularity, he never crossed over like Biz Markie or Big Daddy Kane, both also members of the Juice Crew.      G Rap began a solo career in the mid-1990s, released 4,5,6. This and subsequent LPs saw little attention from critics or consumers, and G Rap began collaborating with others. Signing to Rawkus Records, G Rap launched a comeback with 2002’s The Giancana Story. “Giancana” also is said by Kool G Rap to be the “G” in his name in the song “Drama”. The album was well-received without commercial success.      In 2008 he released Half a Klip on Chinga Chang Records, featuring production from DJ Premier and Marley Marl, among others. His 2011 album Riches, Royalty, Respect showcased his true to form style and lyricism.
