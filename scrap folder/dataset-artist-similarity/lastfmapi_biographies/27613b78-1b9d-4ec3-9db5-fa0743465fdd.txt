**Herbert Jeffrey Hancock** (born April 12, 1940) is a [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) [pianist](http://www.last.fm/tag/pianist) and [composer](http://www.last.fm/tag/composer) from [Chicago](http://www.last.fm/tag/chicago), [Illinois](http://www.last.fm/tag/illinois), [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States). Hancock is one of jazz music’s most important and influential pianists and composers. He embraced elements of [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock), [funk](http://www.last.fm/tag/funk), and [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) while adopting freer stylistic elements from jazz.      As part of [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis)’ “second great quintet” Hancock helped redefine the role of a jazz rhythm section, and was later one of the first jazz musicians to embrace synthesizers and [jazz funk](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20funk). Yet for all his restless experimentation, Hancock’s music is often melodic and accessible; he has had many songs “crossover” and achieve success among [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) audiences.      Probably the most influential era in Herbie Hancock’s extensive career is with the [”Headhunters”](http://www.last.fm/music/the+headhunters) ensemble during the mid-late 70’s, including (among others) [Paul Jackson](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Jackson) on bass, [Bennie Maupin](http://www.last.fm/music/Bennie+Maupin) on saxophones, [Harvey Mason](http://www.last.fm/music/Harvey+Mason) on drums, [”Wah Wah” Watson](http://www.last.fm/music/WAH+WAH+WATSON) on guitar and [Bill Summers](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Summers) on percussion.      His 2007 tribute album, [River: The Joni Letters](http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock/River:+The+Joni+Letters) won the 2008 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.      Early life and career      Like many jazz pianists, Hancock started with a classical music education; Hancock studied from age seven. His talent was recognized early, and he played the first movement of Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 5 at a young people’s concert with the Chicago Symphony at age eleven.[1]      Through his teens, Hancock never had a jazz teacher. Instead, around high school age, Hancock grew to like jazz after hearing some Oscar Peterson and George Shearing recordings, which he transcribed in his own time, and which developed his ear and sense of harmony. He was also influenced by records of the vocal group the Hi-Lo’s:      …by the time I actually heard the Hi-Lo’s, I started picking that stuff out; my ear was happening. I could hear stuff and that’s when I really learned some much farther-out voicings -like the harmonies I used on ‘Speak Like a Child’ -just being able to do that. I really got that from Clare Fischer’s arrangements for the Hi-Lo’s. Clare Fischer was a major influence on my harmonic concept… He and Bill Evans, and Ravel and Gil Evans, finally. You know, that’s where it really came from
