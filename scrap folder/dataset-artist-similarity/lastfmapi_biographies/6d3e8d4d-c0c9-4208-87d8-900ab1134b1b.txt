Born on 28th April 1926 in East Durham, New York, of mixed Scottish and Norwegian ancestry, Dearie began her career in vocal groups in New York.

After signing to [Verve](http://www.last.fm/label/Verve), Dearie returned to the U.S. where, despite developing a successful career and achieving international fame, by 1974 the lack of interest from major labels led her to start her own label, Daffodil Records. She continued performing into her eighties.      Blossom Dearie died on 7th February 2009, at her apartment in Greenwich Village, New York City
