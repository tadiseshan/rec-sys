Anthony B is the stage name of Keith Blair (born March 31, 1976), a Jamaican musician.      Blair grew up in rural Clarks Town in the northwestern parish of Trelawny. His deeply religious family life (his mother was a Seventh-day Adventist and his grandmother a Revivalist) imbued him with a profound spirituality. During his youth, his favorite singers were reggae legends [Bob Marley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley), [Peter Tosh](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Tosh), and [Bunny Wailer](http://www.last.fm/music/Bunny+Wailer), musicians who strongly influenced his own style. Peter Tosh’s influence can definitely be heard in Anthony B’s vocal delivery and revolutionary stance.      Anthony B adopted Rastafarian beliefs as a teenager, a decision which was not well-received by his family. The stubborn and determined Anthony B refused to give up his new religion and his dreadlocks and moved to the home of his aunt and uncle in the Kingston suburb, Portmore.      While attending high school, Anthony B debuted as a deejay for the local sound system, Shaggy Hi-Power. In 1988, he befriended reggae artists such as [Determine](http://www.last.fm/music/Determine), [Mega Banton](http://www.last.fm/music/Mega+Banton), [Ricky General](http://www.last.fm/music/Ricky+General) and [Terror Fabulous](http://www.last.fm/music/Terror+Fabulous).      At this point in the reggae industry, singing “slack” songs about women was the popular thing to do. Anthony B did not believe in degrading women and chose to pen politically-slanted songs rather than so-called “gyal chunes.” He hooked up with Little Devon the Half Pint sound-a-like singer he made his debut single “The Living is Hard” on the Wizard label in 1993. Anthony B tried many different producers but found that none of them fit his style of music. Finally, Anthony B teamed up with Richard “Bello” Bell, creating hits such as [Fire Pon Rome](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B/_/Fire+Pon+Rome), [Raid Di Barn](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B/_/Raid+Di+Barn), [Rumour](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B/_/Rumour), and [Repentance Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B/_/Repentance+Time). Anthony B’s 1996 debut album [Real Revolutionary](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B/Real+Revolutionary) was highly acclaimed in the reggae community. In late 1997, Anthony B released [Universal Struggle](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B/Universal+Struggle) which showed that Anthony B had a consistent, high-calibre talent. Anthony B has released a large number of albums since that time including 1999’s [Seven Seals](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B/Seven+Seals) and 2004’s [Untouchable](http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B/Untouchable) which featured collaborations with artists including [Wyclef Jean](http://www.last.fm/music/Wyclef+Jean).
