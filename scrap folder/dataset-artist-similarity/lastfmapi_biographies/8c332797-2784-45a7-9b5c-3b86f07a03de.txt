**Afroman** (born Joseph Edgar Foreman, on 28 July 1974 in Mississippi) is a [rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/rap) artist from South-Central Los Angeles, California, but later moved to eastern Palmdale (which he has referred to in his songs).       His best-known song is the 2001 hit “[Because I Got High](http://www.last.fm/music/Afroman/_/Because+I+Got+High)”, which gained popularity through Napster, local radio play, a feature on Howard Stern’s radio show, and the ‘stoner’ movie ‘Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back’ (and accompanying [soundtrack](http://www.last.fm/tag/soundtrack)). His other most popular song, “[Crazy Rap](http://www.last.fm/music/Afroman/_/Crazy+Rap)”, is often referred to as “[Colt 45](http://www.last.fm/music/Afroman/_/Colt+45)” because of its lyric “Colt 45 and two Zig Zags”.      Afroman is also fond of referencing his independence from record labels and the “corporate world” and cites himself as an example of how an artist can take recording and distribution into their own hands.      In 2014 Afroman became a spokesman for NORML and Weedmaps, remade “Because I Got High” in favor of legalization, and released the EP “One Hit Wonder” and concept album “The Frorider.”      <http://www.afromanmuzzicc.com>
