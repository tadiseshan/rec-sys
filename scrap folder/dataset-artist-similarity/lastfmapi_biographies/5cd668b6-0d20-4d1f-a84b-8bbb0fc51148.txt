Eddy Mitchell (born Claude Moine July 3, 1942, Paris) is a French singer and actor. He began his career in the late 1950s, with the group [Les Chaussettes Noires](http://www.last.fm/music/Les+Chaussettes+Noires) (The Black Socks), taking his name from the American expatriate tough-guy actor Eddie Constantine (later the star of Jean-Luc Godardâ€™s Alphaville). The band performed at the Parisian nightclub Le Golf Drouot before signing to Barclay Records and finding almost instant success; in 1961 it sold two million records.      Heavily influenced by American rock & roll, Mitchell (who went solo in 1963) has often recorded outside France, at first in London, but later in Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee. Guitarist [Jimmy Page](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Page) and drummer [Bob Graham](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Graham) were among the British session musicians who regularly supported him in London.
