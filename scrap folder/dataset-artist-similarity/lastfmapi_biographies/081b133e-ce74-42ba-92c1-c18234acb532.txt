**Andrew Bird** (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician. He was born in Lake Bluff, Illinois and resides in the Chicago area. Bird is a singer, a violinist and, since 2004, a guitarist. He is also an accomplished whistler.      His early work, which echoed [gypsy](http://www.last.fm/tag/gypsy) [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) and traditional [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk), has led into his current sound, which mixes [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own.      Trained by the Suzuki method from a young age and a graduate of Illinois’ Northwestern University, Bird released his first solo album, _Music of Hair_, in 1996. Vastly different from his later releases, this first album showcases his violin skills and pays tribute to his fascination with both American and European [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) traditions, as well as [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) and [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues).      His initial commercial exposure was in collaborative work with the band [Squirrel Nut Zippers](http://www.last.fm/music/Squirrel+Nut+Zippers). He was quickly lumped in with the [swing](http://www.last.fm/tag/swing) craze that swept the United States music industry in the mid ’90s; this is an affiliation that he is still working to shed.      Taking on the role of band leader in 1997 with [Andrew Bird’s Bowl of Fire](http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird%27s+Bowl+of+Fire), he released the album _Thrills_. This was followed by _Oh! The Grandeur_ in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument.      In 2001, Bird released _The Swimming Hour_, his third release with the Bowl of Fire and a dramatic departure from previous recordings. _The Swimming Hour_ featured a mixture of styles, from the [zydeco](http://www.last.fm/tag/zydeco)-influenced “Core and Rind” to more straightforward rock songs. He has often referred to this record as his “jukebox album”.      The Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded some time in 2003, having featured many skilled Chicago musicians including Kevin O’Donnell, Nora O’Connor, Andy Hopkins (aka [Mr. Rudy Day](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Rudy+Day)), Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn and Ryan Hembrey.      Bird then released two subsequent solo albums, both distributed through the label operated by [Ani DiFranco](http://www.last.fm/music/Ani+DiFranco), [Righteous Babe Records](http://www.righteousbabe.com/). The two records, 2003’s _Weather Systems_ and 2005’s _The Mysterious Production of Eggs_, continue a progression towards an eclectic indie folk sound that has proven challenging to classify.      Bird’s live solo shows have been notable in that he uses a multi-track system to sample and loop his own performance
