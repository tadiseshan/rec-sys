Chris Garneau is an American singer, songwriter, and pianist, whose distinct musical style combines elements of folk, Americana, pop, baroque, and carnival music. Garneau cites Jeff Buckley, Nina Simone, Nico, and Chan Marshall, among others, as musical influences.      Garneau, a native of Boston, lived with his family in Paris during grade school, and later New Jersey before moving to New York City. Garneau discovered a love of music at a young age while learning to play piano. After high school, Garneau briefly attended Berklee Music School in Boston, but left after completing one term and moved to Brooklyn, NY. There he began writing music and playing live shows at small venues in the East Village and Lower East Side of Manhattan, including CBGB’s Gallery and “The Living Room”.      Garneau eventually signed with Absolutely Kosher Records, an Emeryville, California-based record label. He was brought to the label by Jamie Stewart and Caralee McElroy of Xiu Xiu. Garneau released his debut album Music for Tourists in October 2006 and on iTunes in January 2007. His second project, an EP titled “C-Sides”, was released in December 2007. Garneau’s second full- length album, titled “El Radio,” was released in July 2009.
