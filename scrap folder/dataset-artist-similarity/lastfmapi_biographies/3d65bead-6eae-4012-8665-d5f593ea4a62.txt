Gary Jules (born in 1969 in Fresno, California as Gary Jules Aguirre) is an American singer-songwriter. He is best known for his cover of the Tears for Fears song [Mad World](http://www.last.fm/music/Tears+for+Fears/_/Mad+World), which was featured in the film Donnie Darko.

Some of his early projects/bands were The Ivory Knights, [Our Town Pansies](http://www.last.fm/music/Our+Town+Pansies), Woodenfish and [The Origin](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Origin).      Jules started off his solo recording career with the debut [Greetings From The Side](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Jules/Greetings+From+The+Side). Originally released by A & M, this album slipped through the cracks due to neglect on the label’s part, and Jules was dropped. In 2001, together with friend Michael Andrews, Gary Jules recorded [Trading Snakeoil For Wolftickets](http://www.las t.fm/music/Gary+Jules/Trading+Snakeoil+For+Wolftickets). It was from this album that the remake of Tears for Fears’ [Mad World](http://www.last.fm/music/Tears+for+Fears/_/Mad+World) was subsequently used by Michael Andrews for [Donnie Darko](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Andrews/Donnie+Darko).
