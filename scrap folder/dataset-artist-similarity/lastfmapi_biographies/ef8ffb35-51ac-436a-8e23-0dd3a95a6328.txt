CLUB DOGO from Milano, Italy, is formed by mc’s Jake La Furia, Guè Pequeno and the veteran top-producer DON JOE. Joe has no biases when it comes to production. Any sound, from 80s electro to soul and funky riffs or a traditional Italian song is fair game, providing a richness and versatility rarely to be experienced in other national and international producers. Witnessing this uniqueness, Don Joe is one of the most sought-after European Hip Hop producers, leading him to multiple collaborations with some of the hottest Italian and European artists. In 2003 he produced Club Dogo’s debut album, “Mi Fist”, quickly become a classic in the European Hip Hop scene, climbing the indie chart. After cult-status underground releases the group is steady touring the whole country performing live in clubs, music festivals, street demonstrations (anti-fascism, anti-jail brutality) and as exclusive opening act for american artists like Gangstarr, Slum Village, Ghostface and more. Without a major label the Dogos established a strong, all-round fanbase. Hard lyricism, deep metaphors, poetry, street-cred, wordplay, revolutionary thoughts. In 2004 Donjoe produced all the tracks on Philly’s own Grand Agent’s EP album “Regular”.
