**Delta Lea Goodrem** (born in Sydney on November 9, 1984) is a multi-ARIA Award-winning Australian [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), classically-trained pianist and Logie Award-winning actress. She was launched into popularity starring as Nina Tucker on the popular television soap opera _Neighbours_. She has released three number one albums, _[Innocent Eyes](http://www.last.fm/music/Delta+Goodrem/Innocent+Eyes)_, _[Mistaken Identity](http://www.last.fm/music/Delta+Goodrem/Mistaken+Identity)_, and _[Delta](http://www.last.fm/music/Delta+Goodrem/Delta)_, enjoying the second highest number of weeks for an Australian album in the #1 position in Australia and has had eight #1 singles in Australia. Her third album, _Delta_ was released in October 2007, and features the singles [In This Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Delta+Goodrem/_/In+This+Life) and [Believe Again](http://www.last.fm/music/Delta+Goodrem/_/Believe+Again). It was described by Delta herself as “a lot lighter”, and a departure from the dark days of _Mistaken Identity_.      Goodrem has to date achieved eight #1 ARIA singles and multiple UK Top 10 singles. Her debut album, 2003’s _Innocent Eyes_, made her one of Australia’s highest-selling female recording artists, spending 29 weeks at #1, and selling over a million copies in Australia and 2.5 million worldwide. While 2004’s _Mistaken Identity_ was unable to match the commercial success of its predecessor, it entered the ARIA charts at #1 and gained multi-platinum status. To date, Goodrem has sold 3.5 million albums worldwide. In 2005, she embarked on _The Visualise Tour_, her debut concert tour of Australia.      In 2003, at the age of 18 and amidst her blooming career, Goodrem was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, a form of cancer. She has since made a full recovery and now spends much of her time promoting cancer charities.      Goodrem was invited to write and sing the theme song of the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games. Named ‘Together We Are One’, the track was co-written with her ex, Brian McFadden and long-time collaborator Guy Chambers. ‘Together We Are One’ was not originally planned for release as a single, but due to Australian public demand, it was released and peaked at #2 on the official ARIA charts.      Over the last couple of years, Goodrem has been trying to crack the tough U.S music industry, where she is relatively unknown. However, she has recently been making headlines when spotted with 19-year old Nick Jonas, member of the Jonas Brothers. The couple are separated with a 7-year age gap which has sparked controversy in both America and Australia.
