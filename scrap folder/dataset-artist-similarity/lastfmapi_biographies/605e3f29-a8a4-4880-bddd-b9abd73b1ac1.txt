Five Star, a five-piece British [dance pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/dance%20pop) group inspired by [funky](http://www.last.fm/tag/funky) [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul), is internationally famous for a run of success in the [80s](http://www.last.fm/tag/80s). They released three platinum selling albums from 1985 to 1987. Their flashy, self-made costumes and [energetic](http://www.last.fm/tag/energetic) dance routines appealed well to the surging [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) movement.      Five Star are siblings Deniece (later to be called ‘Denise’) Pearson (lead vocals/song writer), Stedman Pearson (costume designer), Lorraine Pearson (spokesperson & song writer), Doris Pearson (choregrapher) and Delroy Pearson (song writer & producer).      Born in Romford Essex to record owner Buster Pearson, Deniece, at the age of 15, persuaded, her father to allow Deniece and her sisters to record “Problematic”. The Pearson parents liked what they heard but also insisted that Deniece’s brothers joined the group. Hence, Five Star was born.      In 1983 Five Star appeared on BBC’s Pebble Mill at One singing and dancing to ‘Problematic’. The BBC switchboard was jamed with record companies wanting to sign the group - Buster said the group were signed to his label Tent Records but they needed a larger company to buy Tent records and hence aquire Five Star. RCA/BMG snapped up the young group and in 1984 their debut single ‘Hide and Seek’ was released (at the time youngest member Delroy was still at high school and lead singer Deniece had only just left school). Neither ‘Hide and Seek’ or its follow-up ‘Crazy’ managed to chart.      In May 1985 the group scored their first top 20 hit with ‘All Fall Down’. This was followed with another top 20 hit ‘Let Me Be The One’. Their debut album ‘Luxury of Life’ was released in August 1985, it would spend 70 weeks in the album charts but did not hit the top 20 until a year after its initial release.      Five Star released two more hits in 1985 - top 30 hit ‘Love Take Over’ and ‘RSVP’ which stalled at 45 in the charts.      1986 was to be a big year for Five Star. In Jan 86 they released the number 3 smash hit ‘System Addict’, which also helped their album get to number 12 in the album charts. However no rest for the group as in April 86 they released the top ten smash ‘Can’t Wait Another Minute’ (the first song from their second album), This was followed up in July 1986 with ‘Find The Time’ another top ten hit for the young group.      In Aug 1986 Five Star released their 2nd album ‘Silk & Steel’, the album spent 58 weeks in the album chart and hit the number one spot! They broke a record for being the youngest act to top the UK album charts. In Sept 86 they released their biggest hit ‘Rain or Shine’, which went to number 2 and stayed in the singles chart for 11 weeks. ‘If I Say Yes’ was released in Nov 1986 and co-incided with their first tour
