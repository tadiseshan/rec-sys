George Ivan Morrison (generally known as **Van Morrison**) (born 31 August 1945) is a Grammy Award-winning artist from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He’s a singer, songwriter, author, poet, and multi-instrumentalist, who has been a professional musician since 1958. He plays a variety of instruments, including the guitar, harmonica, keyboards, drums, and saxophone. Featuring his characteristic growl - a unique mix of folk, blues, Irish, scat, and Celtic influences - Morrison is widely considered one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of rock and roll.      Known as “Van the Man” by his fans, Morrison first rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Northern Irish band [Them](http://www.last.fm/music/Them), writing their 1964 hit “Gloria”. A few years later, Morrison left the band for a successful solo career, starting with the album _Astral Weeks_.      Morrison has pursued an idiosyncratic musical path. Much of his music is tightly structured around the conventions of American soul and R&B, such as the popular singles “Brown Eyed Girl”, “Moondance”, “Domino”, and “Wild Night”. An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as his classic album _Astral Weeks_ and lesser known works such as _Veedon Fleece_ and _Common One_. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as “Celtic Soul,” and Morrison rejects the characterization of his genre of music as Rock, citing Elvis Presley as a non-influence.      He continues to perform regularly, and achieved his highest U.S. chart position (number ten on the Billboard 200) with his latest album, _Keep It Simple_.
