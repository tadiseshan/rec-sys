John Hiatt (born on August 20, 1952 in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.) is an American [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) and [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) guitarist, pianist, and [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter). He has been nominated for eleven Grammy Awards. Hiatt’s sales have never quite matched his reputation. His songs have been covered by a wide variety of artists such as [Bonnie Raitt](http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Raitt), [Ronnie Milsap](http://www.last.fm/music/Ronnie+Milsap), [Willie Nelson](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson), [Iggy Pop](http://www.last.fm/music/Iggy+Pop), [Three Dog Night](http://www.last.fm/music/Three+Dog+Night), and [The Neville Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Neville+Brothers), yet it took him thirteen years to reach the charts himself.      As well, it nearly took him that long to find his own style. Hiatt began his solo career in 1974, and over the next decade he ran through a number of different styles from rock & roll to [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave)-esque [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) before he finally settled on a rootsy fusion of rock, country, blues, and folk with his 1987 album ‘_[Bring The Family](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Hiatt/Bring+The+Family)_’. Though the album didn’t set the charts on fire, it became his first album to gain some major commercial success, and several of the songs on the record became hits for other artists, including the aforementioned Raitt and Milsap. Following its success, Hiatt became a reliable hit songwriter for other artists, and he developed a strong cult following that continued to gain strength into the mid-[90s](http://www.last.fm/tag/90s).      While he was growing up in his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, Hiatt played in a number of garage bands. Initially, he was inspired by the [Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Rolling+Stones) and [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan), and the music of those two artists would echo strongly throughout his work. Out of all the bar bands he played with in the late [60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s), a group called The White Ducks was the one that received the most attention. Following his high-school graduation, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 18, where he landed a job as a songwriter for Tree Publishing.      For the next several years, he wrote and performed at local clubs and hotels. Within a few years, his songs were being recorded by several different artists, including [Conway Twitty](http://www.last.fm/music/Conway+Twitty), [Tracy Nelson](http://www.last.fm/music/Tracy+Nelson), and [Three Dog Night](http://www.last.fm/music/Three+Dog+Night), who took Hiatt’s “Sure as I’m Sittin’ Here” to number 16 in the summer of 1974. Eventually, his manager secured him an audition at Epic Records, and the label signed him in 1974, releasing his debut album, Hangin’ Around the Observatory, later that year
