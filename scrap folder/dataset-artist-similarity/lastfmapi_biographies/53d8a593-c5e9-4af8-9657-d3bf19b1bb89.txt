Christopher Young (b. 1957) is an award-winning composer of music for film and television.      Born on 28th April 1957 in Redbank, New Jersey, Young graduated from Hampshire College in Massachusetts with a Bachelor of Arts in music, and then did postgraduate work at North Texas State University. In 1980 he moved to Los Angeles. A jazz drummer at first, hearing some of Bernard Herrmannâ€™s works convinced him to be a film composer. At the UCLA Film School, he studied under David Raksin.      He composed the scores to more than seventy films, including _Hellraiser_, _Swordfish_, _The Shipping News_, and _Species_.
