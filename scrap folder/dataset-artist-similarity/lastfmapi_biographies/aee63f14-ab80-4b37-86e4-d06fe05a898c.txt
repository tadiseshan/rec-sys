Cathy Dennis (born March 25, 1969 in Norwich, England) is a dance-oriented pop singer-songwriter, record producer and actress.      Dennis achieved her first success as a vocalist with Dancin’ Danny D’s dance project D Mob, when their single “C’mon and Get My Love” reached #15 in the UK Singles Chart and #10 in the Billboard Hot 100 in 1990. Originally, it had only reached #93 (UK). It is regarded as an underground classic in the dance music field, and a second collaboration with D Mob, “That’s The Way Of The World,” was also a major dance hit. It was followed by Dennis’ debut album, Move to This.      She subsequently scored three solo Top 20 UK / Top 10 U.S. hits and had considerable success in Japan in the early 1990s with “Just Another Dream” (#13 UK, #9 U.S., #14 Australia), “Touch Me (All Night Long)” (#5 UK, #2 U.S., #16 Australia), which is probably her most remembered hit to date, and “Too Many Walls” (#17 UK, #8 U.S., #57 Australia).      Subsequent releases were only minor hits. Her final Top 40 hit in the U.S. was “You Lied to Me” in 1992, and her final Top 40 hit in the UK was “Waterloo Sunset”, which made #11 during 1997. That same year her last solo single “When Your Dreams Turn To Dust”, peaked in the UK at #43.      “Touch Me (All Night Long)” stayed at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, and was kept out of the #1 spot by Hi-Five’s “I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)” the first week and Mariah Carey’s “I Don’t Wanna Cry” the second week. The song was a cover of a 1985 single by Wish featuring Fonda Rae, which had hit #70 on the U.S. R&B chart that year. “Touch Me” did reach #1 on the U.S. Dance chart, and its follow-up, “Too Many Walls,” which Dennis co-wrote with Anne Dudley of Art of Noise, was a #1 Adult Contemporary hit. It was around this time Dennis agreed to join MTV Club’s first tour, booked for six weeks. She dropped out on the third date, later publicly accussing one of Milli Vanilli’s members (the tour’s headline act) of sexual harassment.      Dennis released her second album, Into The Skyline, in December 1992 written with an aim toward the U.S. market. The album featured the singles “You Lied To Me”, “Irresistible”, “Falling” and “Why [D Mob with Cathy Dennis]”. The album got to #8 in the UK, whilst in the U.S., “You Lied to Me” was a Top 40 hit and “Irresistible” made the Adult Contemporary Top Ten; however, the album descended the chart rapidly. Dennis experienced a brief peak of fame, making a cameo in Beverly Hills 90210 singing the song “Moments of Love” (a minor U.S. AC chart hit), “Why” and “Touch Me (All Night Long)”. In Japan the album was called Into the Skyline +1, and featured three extra tracks, “Nothing Moves Me”, a previous b-side, and two tracks that were both released as singles, “It’s My Style” and “Love’s a Cradle.”      Dennis started to record her third album Inspiration
