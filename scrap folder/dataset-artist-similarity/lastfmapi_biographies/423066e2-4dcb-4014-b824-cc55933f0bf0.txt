There are at least two artists by this name:      1\. Vic Damone is an Italian American singer originally named Vito Rocco Farinola; born 12 Jun 1928 in Brooklyn, NY, USA. [Perry Como](http://www.last.fm/music/Perry+Como) visited the theater & Vic took him to his dressing room, to perform for him. Como liked the performance enough to take him under his wing & referred him to a local bandleader. Then, he took the name Damone (his Italian mother’s maiden name).      He entered the talent search, on Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts & won the competition, in Apr 1947 - This led to him getting a regular role on Godfrey’s show (as with many other winners). At the station, he ran into [Milton Berle](http://www.last.fm/music/Milton+Berle), who provided a chance to do regular shows at two night clubs. By the middle of 1947, he had a contract with Mercury Records.      His first release, “I Have But One Heart” (30 Aug), reached #7 on the Billboard chart & “You Do” (1 Nov), reached the same peak. These were followed by a number of other hits. In 1948 he got his own weekly radio show, Saturday Night Serenade.      His final album was issued in 1997, with other albums re-packaged & re- released.      2\. Vic Damone is a [rap](http://www.last.fm/tag/rap) artist from South Jamaica, NY who features on the “Queens Da Movement” mixtape (aka [QDM](http://www.last.fm/music/QDM)) and is signed to Def Squad/Universal Records.
