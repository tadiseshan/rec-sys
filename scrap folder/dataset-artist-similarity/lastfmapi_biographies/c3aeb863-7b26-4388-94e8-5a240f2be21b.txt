**Tom Waits** (born Thomas Alan Waits, in Pomona, California, on December 7, 1949) is a prolific American singer, songwriter, composer, and actor.      He started his career in the early 1970s as a singer in spit ‘n’ sawdust bars. Initially, he was deeply influenced by the beat generation, novelists like [Jack Kerouac](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Kerouac) and [William S. Burroughs](http://www.last.fm/music/William+S.+Burroughs), and poets like [Allen Ginsberg](http://www.last.fm/music/Allen+Ginsberg) and [Charles Bukowski](http://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Bukowski). Waits is often compared to Charles Bukowski, being similar both in content and lifestyle, although Waits’s views are more egalitarian than Bukowski’s. Waits was unable to make a living from his music in the 70s because his classical bar music, based in pre-rock, and [americana](http://www.last.fm/tag/americana), [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues), and [vaudeville](http://www.last.fm/tag/vaudeville) styles were not popular. Waits’s voice back then was soft, warm and clear.      Waits subsequently developed a devoted cult following and has influenced subsequent songwriters, despite having little radio or music video support. In fact, his songs are perhaps best known to the general public in the form of cover versions of more visible artists, such as the [Eagles](http://www.last.fm/music/Eagles), [Bruce Springsteen](http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen) and [Rod Stewart](http://www.last.fm/music/Rod+Stewart).      Although Waits’s albums have met with mixed commercial success in his native United States, they have occasionally achieved gold album sales status in other countries.      Lyrically, Waits’s songs are known for atmospheric portrayals of seedy characters and places; he sings about the losers on the streets: alcoholics, junkies, prostitutes and social outcasts, although he also includes more conventional and touching ballads in his repertoire.      While opening for [Frank Zappa](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Zappa), the audience catcalled and refused to listen to him; he was an unsuitable match with Zappa’s avantgarde style.      Countless cigarettes, gallons of alcohol and many all night parties eventually left their trace in his face and voice.      His more recent gravelly voice can be first heard on [Small Change](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits/Small+Change). This distinctive voice turned out to be his trademark. It is described by the Music Hound Rock Album Guide as sounding “like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months and then taken outside and run over with a car”. [Small Change](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits/Small+Change) with its sentimental ballads, its bar-jazz attitude and Film Noir-oriented stories turned out to be his biggest commercial success in the 1970s.      Waits subsequently developed a more unique style
