Warren William Zevon (January 24, 1947 - September 7, 2003) was an American [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag /singer-songwriter) and musician noted for including his unique and sometimes sardonic opinions of life in his musical lyrics, composing songs that were sometimes humorous and often had political or historical themes.      Zevon’s work has often been praised by well-known musicians, including Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young. His best-known compositions include “Werewolves of London”, “Lawyers, Guns and Money”, “Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner” and “Johnny Strikes Up The Band,” all of which are featured on his third album, Excitable Boy (1978). Other well-known songs written by Zevon have been recorded by other artists, including “Poor Poor Pitiful Me” (a top 40 hit by Linda Ronstadt), “Accidentally Like a Martyr,” “Mohammed’s Radio”, “Carmelita”, and “Hasten Down the Wind”.      Along with his own compositions, Zevon recorded or performed occasional covers, including Bob Dylan’s “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” and Leonard Cohen’s “First We Take Manhattan”. He was a frequent guest on Late Night with David Letterman and the Late Show with David Letterman. Letterman later performed guest vocals on “Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)” with Paul Shaffer and members of the CBS Orchestra.      He was born to a Russian Jewish father and a Mormon mother and soon moved to California. At the age of 12/13, Warren Zevon was a regular visitor to the home of [Igor Stravinsky](http://www.last.fm/music/Igor+Stravinsky) where he, along with [Robert Craft](http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Craft), would study music.      He turned to a musical career early, including a stretch as part of a Sonny and Cher-type male/female duo called [Lyme And Cybelle](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Lyme+And+Cybelle), and spent time as a session musician (notably as piano player for the Everly Brothers) and jingle composer. He wrote several songs for his White Whale label-mates the Turtles, though his participation in their recording is unknown. Another early composition (“She Quit Me”) was included in the soundtrack for Midnight Cowboy, released in 1969. His first attempt at a solo album, Wanted Dead or Alive (1969), did not fare well, and his second effort, Leaf in the Wind, was scrapped (though release was considered just prior to his death). In the early 70s he toured regularly with the Everly Brothers as keyboard player and band leader/musical coordinator. His dissatisfaction with his career and the opportunities for a song-writer led him to move to Spain briefly, where he played in a small bar owned by a former mercenary. Together, they penned Zevon’s classic “Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner
