Roy Ayers was born on September 10, 1940 in Los Angeles. Thanks to his trombone playing father and piano teaching mother, he became immersed in music from day one and the story goes that he was given his first set of vibe mallets by his hero Lionel Hampton at the age of 5. Constantly performing and recording since the 1960s, he is one of the most famous jazz vibraphonists. He has produced some of the most loved modern soul-jazz records of all time such as, “Everybody Loves The Sunshine”, most influential afro-jazz with musician Fela Anikulapo-Kuti (Africa - Centre Of The World) and the most seminal jazz- funk, such as “Running Away”. And that’s just the surface. 2004 saw the release of “Virgin Ubiquity: Unreleased Recordings 1976-1981” which were ‘lost’ sessions tapes that he had discarded. Gilles Peterson described this as the equivalent of finding a lost Beatles album. No doubt this helped him win the Gilles Peterson 2004 Worldwide Lifetime Achievement Award. Roy Ayers is ageless and evergreen and as per the title of another one of hits, remember “We All Live In Brooklyn Baby”.      <http://www.royayers.com>   <http://www.bassics.de/ayers.html>   <http://www.discomuseum.com/RoyAyers.html>
