**Sibylle Baier** is a German folk singer and actress whose musical abilities achieved belated recognition with the 2006 release of the album Colour Green, compiled from songs she had recorded in the early 1970s.      Having played guitar and piano as a young girl, she was moved to write her first song, “Remember The Day”, after taking a road trip with a friend across the Alps to Genoa, via Strasbourg. She appeared in Wim Wenders’ 1973 film _Alice in the Cities_, and her music also featured in _Umarmungen und andere Sachen_ (1975), a German Jochen Richter film set in Bavaria about three romantically involved bank robbers. Baier opted not to pursue an acting or singing career, and moved to America where she concentrated on raising a family.      The songs that went on to make up her album Colour Green were home reel-to- reel tape recordings Baier had made in Germany between 1970 and 1973. Some thirty years later her son Robby compiled a CD from these recordings to give to family members as presents. He also gave a copy to [Dinosaur Jr](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Dinosaur+Jr)’s [J Mascis](http://www.last.fm/music/J+Mascis), who in turn passed it along to the [Orange Twin](http://www.last.fm/label/Orange+Twin) label. Orange Twin released the album in February 2006. She is expected to release a second studio album. She performs the song “Let Us Know” in Wim Wenders’ movie _Palermo Shooting_ (2008).
