PMMP was a popular pop band from Finland. Although the name PMMP is often thought to refer only to singers Paula Vesala and Mira Luoti, the band consists of the female vocalists and three male musicians, Mikko Virta, Juho Vehmanen, and Heikki Kytölä. Their songs are composed by Jori Sjöroos ([Thergothon](http://www.last.fm/music/Thergothon), [This Empty Flow](http://www.last.fm/music/This+Empty+Flow), [Fu- Tourist](http://www.last.fm/music/Fu-Tourist), [Magenta Skycode](http://www.last.fm/music/Magenta+Skycode)), who also plays all the instruments on their first and second albums, and most of them on the third. The lyrics are written by Paula and Mira. PMMP played last concert at Jäähalli in Helsinki on 27th October 2013.      The name of the band is said to be an abbreviation of the sentence “**P**aulan ja **M**iran **M**olemmat **P**uolet”, which can be translated into English as “Both Sides of Paula and Mira”.      PMMP came to daylight during the summer of 2003 with their hit song [Rusketusraidat](http://www.last.fm/music/PMMP/_/Rusketusraidat). It was also the biggest selling single in Finland that year. They have so far released four studio albums: [Kuulkaas Enot!](http://www.last.fm/music/PMMP/Kuulkaas+Enot!) (2003), [Kovemmat Kädet](http://www.last.fm/music/PMMP/Kovemmat+K%C3%A4det) (2005), [Leskiäidin Tyttäret](http://www.last.fm/music/PMMP/Leski%C3%A4idin+Tytt%C3%A4ret) (2006) and [Veden varaan](http://www.last.fm/music/PMMP/Veden+varaan) (2009). Leskiäidin tyttäret sold platinum (30 000 copies in Finland) on the day it was released.      In 2004, PMMP won the award for “Best new band of 2003” at the Finnish music makers awards gala Emma and in 2006 Kovemmat kädet, the real break-through album of the band, was given several awards at the same gala, including “Best Finnish pop album of 2005”. The Finnish music magazine Rumba also named the album as “Best Finnish album of 2005” and the song [Matkalaulu](http://www.last.fm/music/PMMP/_/Matkalaulu) as “Best Finnish song of 2005”.      PMMP’s musical style ranges from catchy pop tunes to punk, with famously energetic live performances. They have covered songs by classic Finnish punk bands like [Kollaa Kestää](http://www.last.fm/music/Kollaa+Kest%C3%A4%C3%A4), [Ypö-Viis](http://www.last.fm/music/Yp%C3%B6-Viis), [Päät](http://www.last.fm/music/P%C3%A4%C3%A4t), [Puhelinkoppi](http://www.last.fm/music/Puhelinkoppi) and [Maukka Perusjätkä](http://www.last.fm/music/Maukka+Perusj%C3%A4tk%C3%A4). They have also recorded a hit song [Pikkuveli](http://www.last.fm/music/PMMP/_/Pikkuveli) originally performed by [Noitalinna Huraa!](http://www.last.fm/music/Noitalinna+Huraa!). It was released on a special version of the album [Kovemmat Kädet](http://www.last.fm/music/PMMP/Kovemmat+K%C3%A4det).
