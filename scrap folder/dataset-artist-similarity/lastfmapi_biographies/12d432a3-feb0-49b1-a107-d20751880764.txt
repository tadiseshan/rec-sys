**Yann Tiersen** (born June 23, 1970 in Brest, Brittany, [France](http://www.last.fm/place/France)) has been honing his musical aesthetic since he could stand on two legs. He started learning piano at the age of four, taking up violin at the age of six and receiving classical training at musical academies in Rennes, Nantes and Boulogne. Then, at the age of 13, he chose to alter his destiny, breaking his violin into pieces, buying a guitar and forming a rock band.       Yann Tiersen has collaborated with vocal artists like [Claire Pichet](http://www.last.fm/music/Claire+Pichet) (“[Le Phare](http://www.last.fm/music/Yann+Tiersen/Le+Phare)” and “[Rue Des Cascades](http://www.last.fm/music/Yann+Tiersen/Rue+Des+Cascades)”), [Elizabeth Fraser](http://www.last.fm/music/Elizabeth+Fraser) (“[Les Retrouvailles](http://www.last.fm/music/Yann+Tiersen/Les+Retrouvailles)”) and [Shannon Wright](http://www.last.fm/music/Shannon+Wright) (“[Yann Tiersen and Shannon Wright](http://www.last.fm/music/Yann+Tiersen/Yann+Tiersen+and+Shannon +Wright)”). Other musicians he has worked with include [The Divine Comedy](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy), [Noir Désir](http://www.last.fm/music/Noir+D%C3%A9sir), [dominique A.](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/dominique+A.), [Francoiz Breut](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Francoiz+Breut), [Les Têtes Raides](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Les+T%C3%AAtes+Raides), [The Married Monk](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Married+Monk) and [Sage Francis](http://www.last.fm/music/Sage+Francis)      Tiersen got a musical education from the city of Rennes’ annual Transmusicales festival, seeing acts like Nirvana, Einstürzende Neubaten, Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, The Cramps, Television and Suicide. When his band broke up a few years later, instead of hunting for some new musicians, he bought a cheap mixing desk, an eight-track reel, and started recording music solo with a synth, sampler and drum machine, poring over the grooves of old records on the hunt for loops and orchestral strings to plunder.      As it turned out, though, the key to his new approach lay in his own past. “One day I thought, instead of spending days on research and listening to tons of records to find the nearest sound of what I have in mind, why don’t I fix this fucking violin and use it?” Through the summer of 1993, Tiersen stayed in his apartment, recording music alone with guitar, violin and accordion, guided not by the classical canon, but by intuition and his vision of “a musical anarchy”.      By the end of the summer of 1993, Tiersen had recorded over 40 tracks, which would form the bulk of his first two albums. 1995’s La Valse Des Monstres, inspired by Tod Browning’s Freaks and Yukio Mishima’s The Damask Drum was the second album to be released on Nancy-based label Ici, d’ailleurs. It would be followed six months later by Rue Des Cascades, a collection of short pieces recorded with toy piano, harpsichord, violin, accordion and mandolin
