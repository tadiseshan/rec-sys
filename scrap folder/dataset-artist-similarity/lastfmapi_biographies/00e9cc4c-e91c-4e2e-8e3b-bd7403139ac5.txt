Hector Zazou (1948-2008) was a prolific [french](http://www.last.fm/tag/french) composer and record producer who has worked with, produced, and collaborated with an international array of recording artists. Since 1976 he has worked on his own and other artists’ albums, including [Sandy Dillon](http://www.last.fm/music/Sandy+Dillon), [Mimi Goese](http://www.last.fm/music/Mimi+Goese), [Barbara Gogan](http://www.last.fm/music/Barbara+Gogan), [Sevara Nazarkhan](http://www.last.fm/music/Sevara+Nazarkhan), [Carlos Nuñez](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Carlos+Nu%C3%B1ez), Italian group [PGR](http://www.last.fm/music/PGR), [Anne Grete Preus](http://www.last.fm/music/Anne+Grete+Preus), [Laurence Revey](http://www.last.fm/music/Laurence+Revey), and [Sainkho](http://www.last.fm/music/Sainkho).      Long-time collaborators include trumpeter Mark Isham; guitarist Lone Kent; cellist and singer [Caroline Lavelle](http://www.last.fm/music/Caroline+Lavelle); trumpeter Christian Lechevretel, who has appeared on all of Zazou’s albums after Sahara Blue; clarinetist and flutist [Renaud Pion](http://www.last.fm/music/Renaud+Pion), who has appeared on all of Zazou’s albums since _Les Nouvelles Polyphonies Corses_; drummer Bill Rieflin; and Japanese recording artist [Ryuichi Sakamoto](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ryuichi+Sakamoto).      His discography demonstrates his affinity for cross-cultural collaborations, and incorporating modern techniques and sounds in re-recordings of traditional material. He was influenced by [Peter Gabriel](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel)’s album Passion in his fusion of musical polarities (traditional and modern, electronic and acoustic) on his own album _Les Nouvelles Polyphonies Corses_.      Zazou regards his work during the 1980s as his time of apprenticeship in the studio. On his 1986 album, _Reivax au Bongo_, he experimented with fusing classical vocals with an electronic backdrop. On his 1989 album, _Géologies_, he combined electronic music with a string quartet.      The albums that he has released under his own name from the 1990s onwards are usually concept albums that draw from literary or folk sources and revolve around a specific theme. The collection of songs on each album assemble contributions from a diverse and global range of pop, folk, world music, avant-garde, and classical recording acts.      Zazou’s 1992 offering, Sahara Blue, was based on an idea by Jacques Pasquier. Pasquier suggested Zazou commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of author Arthur Rimbaud by setting music to Rimbaud’s poetry. Contributions included spoken word from Gérard Depardieu, and music by [Brendan Perry](http://www.last.fm/music/Brendan+Perry) and [Lisa Gerard](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Lisa+Gerard) of [Dead Can Dance](http://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Can+Dance), [Tim Simenon](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Simenon), and [David Sylvian](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Sylvian)
