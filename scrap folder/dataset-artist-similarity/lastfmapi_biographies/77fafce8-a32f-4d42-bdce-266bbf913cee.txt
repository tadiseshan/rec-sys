Lil Scrappy (born January 20, 1984) is the stage name of rapper Darryl Richards II. He was discovered by producer [Lil Jon](http://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Jon) while performing at a school concert in his hometown of Atlanta. Along with labelmates Trillville, Lil Scrappy was one of the first signings to Lil Jon’s BME Recordings.      Lil Scrappy built a strong reputation and eager following throughout the southeast through mixtapes and the street anthem of 2003 “Head Bussa.” During this time, Lil Jon inked a deal to bring his BME Recordings to Warner Bros. Records as a joint venture partnership. With Lil Jon’s signature production, “Head Bussa” made a strong statement within the radio community, reaching #73 on the Billboard r&b and hip hop chart.      Lil Scrappy’s second single and most commercially successful single to date, “No Problem,” reached the top 30 of the Billboard 100 and was top 10 on the R&B and rap charts. Thanks to the success of “No Problem” and Trillville’s hits “Some Cut” and “Neva Eva,” the joint album reached #3 on the r&b chart and #12 on the Billboard 200 in 2004.
