Busta’s time during the year of 1983 was that of change, his parents got divorced and his way of thinking was altered, during that year he also changed his religious beliefs and re-named himself ‘Born Justice God Allah’ because of the supreme sorts of names that he now believed in and looked up to. He discovered hip hop music through listening to the Zulu Beats Radio Show, something influenced him from that show and three years later he would form a group. Busta also went to school in the United Kingdom, where he lived in Blackpool, Preston and Morecambe. Ended up graduating from George Westinghouse High School in downtown Brooklyn.   As a youngster he played basketball, football and soccer.      His Panamanian baby-sitter, Aunt Mitzi, made him listen to all the rap radio stations. So, He would sit there at 2 in the morning rapping when he was supposed to be sleeping. I just couldn’t be too loud or Mitzi’s poodle would start dancing around and barking. One night, the poodle barked and Mitzi took my radio away. So he said, “I don’t need that radio. I’ll write my own rap songs.” Busta Rhymes later became part of a B-Boy crew with mainly latinos, a couple of white kids, and Busta, the only black one. When he was about 10 years old after he moved from Brooklyn to Long Island, where he became a member of the crew when it was a big contest happening which the leader of the crew, Johnny Juice watched. Busta just came up to him like, “Are you Johnny Juice?” and Johnny answered like “Yeah.” and he said he wanted to be down with this crew. He started poppin’ and Johnny said he was dope so he said “We’re about to do this contest” and they wanted to put him down with them, but he didn’t know the routines. But they put him down anyways and they lost the contest because they didn’t know where to put him in the routine
