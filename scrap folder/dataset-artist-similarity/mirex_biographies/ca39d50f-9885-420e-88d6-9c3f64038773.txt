Erik Schrody (born August 18, 1969 in Valley Stream, New York), better known by his stage name [Everlast](http://www.last.fm/music/Everlast), is a Grammy- Award winning Irish-American rapper and [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), known for his solo hit “[What It’s Like](http://www.last.fm/music/Everlast/_/What+It%27s+Like)” and as being the front-man for rap group [House of Pain](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain).      He was also a part of the hip-hop supergroup [La Coka Nostra](http://www.last.fm/music/La+Coka+Nostra), which consists of his former House of Pain mates, [Danny Boy](http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Boy) and [DJ Lethal](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Lethal) along with underground rap veteran [Ill Bill](http://www.last.fm/music/Ill+Bill) and Irish-American rapper [Slaine](http://www.last.fm/music/Slaine). On July 14, 2009, they released their debut album, ‘[A Brand You Can Trust](http://www.last.fm/music/La+Coka+Nostra/A+Brand+You+Can+Trust)’, through Uncle Howie Records and Suburban Noize Records.      Everlast was born in Valley Stream, New York of Irish descent. His grandfather was of German descent. Emerging as a member of the [Rhyme Syndicate](http://www.last.fm/music/Rhyme+Syndicate), Everlast’s first solo album [Forever Everlasting](http://www.last.fm/music/Everlast/Forever+Everlasting) (1990), largely made possible by MC [Ice T](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ice+T), was a disappointment both critically and commercially. Following the album’s failure, Everlast teamed up with DJ Lethal and high school friend Danny Boy to form House of Pain. The group was signed to [Tommy Boy](http://www.last.fm/label/Tommy+Boy) Records, and their eponymous debut album, [House of Pain](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain/House+of+Pain) (1992), went multi-platinum, spawning the successful [DJ Muggs](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Muggs) produced single [Jump Around](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain/_/Jump+Around). This song was also remixed twice by [Pete Rock](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Rock), one version featuring a verse from him and one without. The album also featured [Cypress Hill](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill) member, [B-Real](http://www.last.fm/music/B-Real), on the song [Put Your Head Out](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain/_/Put+Your+Head+Out).      Fashioning themselves as rowdy Irish American hooligans (Lethal is actually of Latvian heritage), they toured with various rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough. They participated together with [Helmet](http://www.last.fm/music/Helmet), along with several other rap acts, on the influential 1993 rock-rap collaborative [Judgment Night](http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Judgment+Night) movie soundtrack. The group eventually disbanded in 1996, with Everlast pursuing a solo career.      Everlast’s second solo album [Whitey Ford Sings the Blues](http://www.last
