U2 is rock band from Ireland which formed in 1976 in Dublin, Ireland. Since the band’s formation, they have consisted of [Bono](http://www.last.fm/music/Bono) (real name Paul Hewson) (vocals, guitar, harmonica), [The Edge](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Edge) (real name David Evans) (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), [Adam Clayton](http://www.last.fm/music/Adam+Clayton) (bass) and [Larry Mullen, Jr.](http://www.last.fm/music/Larry+Mullen,+Jr.) (drums, percussion). The band is the biggest selling alternative rock act of all time, having sold 150 million albums worldwide as of 2008. They have won 22 Grammys and were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. As of 2009, they have released 12 albums and 58 singles.      **Foundation:** The band originally formed in 1976 when Larry Mullen posted a bulletin in his school asking for musicians to form a rock band. The band then consisted of the four current members plus three additional guitarists, including The Edge’s brother Dick Evans (later a member of [Virgin Prunes](http://www.last.fm/music/Virgin+Prunes)), Ivan McCormick and [Peter Martin](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Martin). According to legend, Bono originally auditioned as a guitarist but couldn’t play. He auditioned as lead vocals, but really couldn’t sing. He was, however, incredibly enthusiastic about the band, extremely charismatic, a great writer, and was strangely able to reach the audience when the band played, something he is known for still today. Bono will reach out into the crowd and dance or mess with someone in the crowd at every concert. He was kept as a member. The extra guitarists would soon leave the band and the group would go through the names “Feedback ” and “The Hype” before finally settling on U2.      **The 70s & 80s:** 1978 was a jumping point year for the band, finally finding their sound / voice. U2 won a talent contest in 1978: £500 and funds to make a record. Paul McGuinness became the band’s manager and U2 released an EP called [Three](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Three) and the single Another Day, the following year. U2 went on to release their first album, [Boy](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Boy) and then more critically acclaimed albums incl.: [October](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/October), [War](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/War), [Under A Blood Red Sky](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Under+A+Blood+Red+Sky), and [The Unforgettable Fire](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Unforgettable+Fire) (featuring the song PlayMLK dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr). Seen by many as a political band with more charisma than others, they were called “a different kind” of band. After a short break U2 returned with [The Joshua Tree](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Joshua+Tree) & the USA music inspired [Rattle And Hum](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Rattle+And+Hum) (also a movie of the same name, based on the tour).      **The 90s:** Promising ”to dream it all up again”, they added industrial and dance styles to their music
