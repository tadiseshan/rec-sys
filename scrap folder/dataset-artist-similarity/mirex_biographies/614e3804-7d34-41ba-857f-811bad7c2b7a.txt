Dire Straits were a [british](http://www.last.fm/tag/british) [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band from Newcastle, United Kingdom, formed in 1977 by [Mark Knopfler](http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Knopfler) (guitar and vocals), his brother [David Knopfler](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Knopfler) (guitar), [John Illsley](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Illsley) (bass), and Pick Withers (drums), and subsequently managed by Ed Bicknell. Dire Straits emerged during the [post-punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/post-punk) era of the late ’70s, and while their sound was minimalistic and stripped down, they owed little to [punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk). If anything, the band was a direct outgrowth of the roots revivalism of [pub rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/pub%20rock), but where pub rock celebrated good times, Dire Straits were melancholy. Led by guitarist/vocalist [Mark Knopfler](http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Knopfler), the group built their sound upon the laid-back [blues-rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues-rock) of [J.J. Cale](http://www.last.fm/music/J.J.+Cale), but they also had jazz and country inflections, occasionally dipping into the epic song structures of [progressive rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20rock). The band’s music was offset by Knopfler’s lyrics, which approximated the winding, stream- of-conscious narratives of [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan). As their career progressed, Dire Straits became more refined and their new maturity happened to coincide with the rise of MTV and the compact disc. These two musical revolutions from the mid-’80s helped make Dire Straits’ fifth studio album, Brothers in Arms, an international blockbuster. The band - along with [Eric Clapton](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton), [Phil Collins](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Collins), and [Steve Winwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Winwood) \- became one of the leaders of a group of self-consciously mature veteran rock & rollers in the late ’80s that designed their music to appeal to aging baby boomers. Despite the band’s international success, they couldn’t sustain their stardom, waiting a full six years to deliver a follow-up to Brothers in Arms, by which time their audience had shrunk significantly.      Knopfler (born August 12, 1949) was always the main force behind Dire Straits. The son of an architect, Knopfler studied English literature at Leeds University and worked briefly as a rock critic for the Yorkshire Evening Post while at college. He began teaching English after his graduation, leading a pub rock band called “Brewer’s Droop” at night. By 1977, Mark was playing with his brother David (guitar) and his roommate John Illsley (bass). During the summer of 1977, the trio cut a demo with drummer Pick Withers. A London DJ named Charlie Gillett heard the demo and began playing “Sultans of Swing” on his BBC show Honky Tonkin’. Following a tour opening for [Talking Heads](http://www.last
