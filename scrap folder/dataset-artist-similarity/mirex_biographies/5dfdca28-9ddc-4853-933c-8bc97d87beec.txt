Marilyn Manson is an American rock band from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States formed in 1989 by frontman Marilyn Manson and [Daisy Berkowitz](http://www.last.fm/music/Daisy+Berkowitz). The group was originally named [Marilyn Manson & The Spooky Kids](http://www.last.fm/music/Marilyn+Manson+&+The+Spooky+Kids), with their theatrical performances gathering a local cult following in the early 1990s, until the band shortened the name in 1992. The band’s lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the current members of Marilyn Manson are the eponymous lead singer (the only remaining original member), bassist [Twiggy Ramirez](http://www.last.fm/music/Twiggy+Ramirez), guitarist [Tyler Bates](http://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Bates), live guitarist [Paul Wiley](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Wiley), and drummer [Gil Sharone](http://www.last.fm/music/Gil+Sharone).      Until 1996, the name of each member was originally created by combining the first name of an iconic female sex symbol and the last name of an iconic serial killer (e.g. [Marilyn Monroe](http://www.last.fm/music/Marilyn+Monroe) and [Charles Manson](http://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Manson)). The members of the band dress in outlandish makeup and costumes, and have engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. In the past, their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs. Their performances have frequently been called offensive and obscene, and, on several occasions, protests and petitions have led to the group being banned from performing.      As this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band’s mainstream popularity. Despite this, in June 2003, veteran rock journalist Jon Wiederhorn of MTV.com referred to Marilyn Manson as “the only true artist today,” and the frontman and band continues to have a strong cult following in 2015. Marilyn Manson has garnered much success: four of the band’s releases have achieved multi-platinum and three albums have gold, and the band has seen seven of its releases debut in the top ten, including two #1 albums. Marilyn Manson has sold over 50 million records.   ______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________      —-HISTORY—-      **The Spooky Kids: 1989-1993**   In 1989, Brian Warner was a college student working toward a journalism degree, and gaining experience in the field by writing music articles for a South Florida lifestyle magazine, 25th Parallel.
