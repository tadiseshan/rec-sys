There are several artists named ‘Nirvana’;      **1) Nirvana** was an American [grunge](http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge) band. The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and it was part of the Seattle [grunge](http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge) scene of the late 80s, alongside bands like [Pearl Jam](http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam), [Alice in Chains](http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains) and [Soundgarden](http://www.last.fm/music/Soundgarden). As their popularity rose, [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television during the early-to-mid ’90s.      In late 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard (1987–1988).The three practiced material from Cobain’s Fecal Matter tape. After losing contact with Burckhard, the pair instead practised with Dale Crover of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988. Their first single, a cover version of “[Love Buzz](http://www.last.fm/music/Shocking+Blue/_/Love+Buzz)”, a song by Dutch group ‘Shocking Blue’, was released in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label [Sub Pop](http://www.last.fm/label/Sub+Pop). Their debut album, _’[Bleach](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Bleach)’_, was produced by Jack Endino and released in June 1989. Later that year, the band recorded the _’[Blew EP](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Blew+EP)’_ with producer Steve Fisk.      At the start of the new decade, the band commenced their first recording sessions to the follow-up album with producer [Butch Vig](http://www.last.fm/music/Butch+Vig), substituted their drummer by [Dave Grohl](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Grohl) and signed to DGC Records. The result, _’[Nevermind](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Nevermind)’_, would eventually sell over seven million copies in the United States, and over 30 million worldwide.      In early 1993, Nirvana released “Puss”/”Oh, the Guilt”, a split single with [The Jesus Lizard](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jesus+Lizard), on the independent label Touch & Go. Meanwhile, the group chose [Steve Albini](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Albini) as the producer to record its third album. _’[In Utero](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/In+Utero)’_ debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart in September the same year.      As **Nirvana**’s frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the “spokesman of a generation”, with **Nirvana** the “flagship band” of “Generation X”, their third studio album _’[In Utero](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/In+Utero)’_ was considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While **Nirvana**’s mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band’s dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the [Meat Puppets](http://www.last
