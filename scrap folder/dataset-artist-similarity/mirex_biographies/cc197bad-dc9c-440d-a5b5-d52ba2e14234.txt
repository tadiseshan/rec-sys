**Coldplay** is a British [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) band, formed in London, [United Kingdom](http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom) in 1997. The band comprises vocalist and pianist [Chris Martin](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Martin), lead guitarist [Jonny Buckland](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonny+Buckland) – who met each other in September 1996 at Ramsay Hall (halls of residence) at University College London - bassist [Guy Berryman](http://www.last.fm/music/Guy+Berryman) and drummer [Will Champion](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Champion).      With five successful albums releases (all of which debuted at #1 on the UK album chart) - and a scheduled sixth album release in May 2014 ([Ghost Stories](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/Ghost+Stories)) - Coldplay have also achieved great success with their singles, such as [Yellow](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Yellow), [Speed of Sound](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Speed+of+Sound), the Grammy-winning [Clocks](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Clocks) and the US and UK #1 single [Viva la Vida](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Viva+la+Vida).         **Influences**   Coldplay’s early material was often compared to that of [Jeff Buckley](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley) and [Radiohead](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead), while also drawing comparisons to [U2](http://www.last.fm/music/U2) and [Travis](http://www.last.fm/music/Travis). Since the release of the band’s debut album, _[Parachutes](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/Parachutes)_ (2000), Coldplay has also drawn influence from other sources, including [Echo And The Bunnymen](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Echo+And+The+Bunnymen) and [George Harrison](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison) on _[A Rush of Blood to the Head](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/A+Rush+of+Blood+to+the+Head)_ (2002) and [Johnny Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash) and [Kraftwerk](http://www.last.fm/music/Kraftwerk) for _[X&Y](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/X&Y)_ (2005).      Frontman Chris Martin credits 1980s Norwegian pop band [a-ha](http://www.last.fm/music/a-ha) for inspiring him to form his own band.      Coldplay never intended to become England’s favorite rock & roll sons when their signature rock melodies ruled the charts throughout 2000. The quartet yearned to mess around a bit, plucking their own acoustics for fun while attending the University College of London. All had been playing instruments since their early teens and had been influenced by the likes of [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan), [The Stone Roses](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses), [Neil Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young), and [My Bloody Valentine](http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine).      They never imagined taking reign of the UK’s ever-changing rock scene. Each member had come from a solid household of middle-class parents who encouraged music. [Chris Martin](http://www.last
