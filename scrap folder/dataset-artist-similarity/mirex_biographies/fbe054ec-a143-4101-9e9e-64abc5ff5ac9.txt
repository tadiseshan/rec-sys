**Nat “King” Cole** (March 17th 1919–February 15th 1965) was a popular American singer and [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) musician.       As a piano player, he formed a jazz trio in 1938 that played Los Angeles nightclubs, one of the first jazz trios featuring guitar and piano. Prior to this he had played music since he was a child and had worked with bands since he was sixteen. He was raised in Chicago and exposed to the abundant jazz scene there. He was heavily influenced by pianist [Earl “Fatha” Hines](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Earl+%22Fatha%22+Hines).      Later he became more popularly known as a singer and crooner and his work became more orchestrated.      His first mainstream vocal hit was in 1944 with [Straighten Up and Fly Right](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Straighten+Up+and+Fly+Right), based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Although hardly a rocker, the song’s success proved that an audience for folk- based material existed. It is considered a predecessor to the first rock and roll records. Indeed, [Bo Diddley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bo+Diddley), who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence.      Beginning in the late 1940s, Cole began recording and performing more pop- oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period with such hits as [The Christmas Song](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/The+Christmas+Song) (1946), [Nature Boy](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Nature+Boy) (1948), [Mona Lisa](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Mona+Lisa) (1950), and his signature tune [Unforgettable](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Unforgettable) (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his musical roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, [After Midnight](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/After+Midnight). In 1991, Mosaic Records released the _Complete Nat King Cole Trio Recordings on Capitol_, which contained 349 songs on twenty-seven LPs or eighteen CDs.      Throughout the 1950s Cole continued to rack up hit after hit, including [Smile](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Smile), [Pretend](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Pretend), [A Blossom Fell](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/A+Blossom+Fell), and [If I May](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/If+I+May). Most of his pop hits were collaborations with famed arranger/conductor [Nelson Riddle](http://www.last.fm/music/Nelson+Riddle). It was with Riddle that Cole released his first ten-inch long-play album in 1953 entitled _Sings for Two in Love_. Several more albums followed, including the [Gordon Jenkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Gordon+Jenkins) arranged [Love Is The Thing](http://www.last
