Source Direct were a jungle / drum & bass production outfit from St. Albans in the United Kingdom, consisting of Phil Aslett and Jim Baker. Their music would best be described as a combination of intensely complex, compressed drum edits, often suffused with a synthesis of menacing soundscapes and jazz-funk samples. They were largely considered to possess a similar production sensibility to [Photek](http://www.last.fm/music/Photek), but with a more pronounced, often hostile edge.      The bulk of their output was released during the mid to late 90s through an assortment of different labels, including: Odyssey, [Certificate 18](http://www.last.fm/label/Certificate+18), Street Beats, [Metalheadz](http://www.last.fm/label/Metalheadz), Basement, [Good Looking Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Good+Looking+Records), [Science](http://www.last.fm/label/Science), and their own [Source Direct Recordings](http://www.last.fm/label/Source+Direct+Recordings) imprint. They also released singles under an array of pseudonyms, such as: [Hokusai](http://www.last.fm/music/Hokusai), [Mirage](http://www.last.fm/music/Mirage), [Sounds of Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Sounds+of+Life), [Intensity](http://www.last.fm/music/Intensity), [X-Files](http://www.last.fm/music/X-Files) and [Oblivion](http://www.last.fm/music/Oblivion).      Aslett and Baker parted ways acrimoniously at the end of 1999 - citing serious creative and personal differences. They would never work together again.
