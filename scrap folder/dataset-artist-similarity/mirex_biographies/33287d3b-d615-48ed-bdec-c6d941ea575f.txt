Orphanage was a Dutch [innovative gregorian groovy celtic melodic danceable doom death metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/innovative%20gregorian%20groovy%20cel tic%20melodic%20danceable%20doom%20death%20metal) band, which existed from 1987 till 2005. They were one of the first Dutch metal bands who mixed death metal grunts with clean female vocals. By mixing very different musical styles they have created their own unique sound.      In 1996, an era in which several new metal-styles and cross-overs arose in the landscape of metal, they described their style as “Innovative gregorian groovy celtic melodic danceable doom death metal” (great lastfm tag!!)      Line-up :   George Oosthoek : Grunts and screams   Rosan Van Der Aa : Vocals   Sureel : Drums and clay pot   Remko Van Der Spek : Bass guitar and guitars   Lasse Dellbrügge : Synths and sound design   Guus Eikens : Guitars, keyboards and vocals      Former members:   Martine van Loon: Vocals   Lex Vogelaar: Guitars and vocals   Eric Hoogendoorn: Bass   Jules Vleugels: Drums   Erwin Polderman: Drums      Mid October 2005, after 11 years, the band split up. The official announcement stated: “From recent internal discussions it appeared that there was too much irritation and a lack of mutual trust, to be able to make a new Orphanage product, by the high quality standards that the band has been known for throughout the years.”.      Singer George Oosthoek is still frequently seen in the Dutch metal scene, performing as guest vocalist for other metal-bands (like [Delain](http://www.last.fm/music/Delain), [After Forever](http://www.last.fm/music/After+Forever) and [Within Temptation](http://www.last.fm/music/Within+Temptation)) or in his own bands like [Pleurisy](http://www.last.fm/music/Pleurisy).
