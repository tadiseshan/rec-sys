**Willie Hugh Nelson** (born April 30, 1933) is an [American](http://www.last.fm/place/united%20states) [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) singer, author, [poet](http://www.last.fm/tag/poet), actor and activist, originally from Abbott, Texas. He reached his greatest fame during the [outlaw country](http://www.last.fm/tag/outlaw%20country) movement of the 19[70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s), but remains iconic, especially in American popular culture.      Nelson was born and raised in Abbott, Texas, the son of Myrle and Ira D. Nelson, who was a mechanic and pool hall owner. His grandparents William Alfred Nelson and Nancy Elizabeth Smothers gave him mail-order music lessons starting at age six. He wrote his first song when he was seven and was playing in a local band at age nine. Willie played the guitar, while his sister Bobbie played the piano. He met Bud Fletcher, a fiddler, and, while he was still in high school, formed a band, the Bohemian Fiddlers, that included two of his siblings.      Nelson took part in the National FFA Organization (formerly known as the Future Farmers of America) while in high school.      Beginning in high school Nelson worked as a disc jockey for local radio stations. Nelson had short DJ stints with KHBR in Hillsboro, Texas, and later with KBOP in Pleasanton, Texas, as well as singing gigs in [honky tonk](http://www.last.fm/tag/honky%20tonk) bars.      Nelson graduated from Abbott High School in 1951. He joined the Air Force the same year but was discharged after nine months due to back problems. He then studied agriculture at Baylor University for one year in 1954.      In 1956, Nelson moved to Vancouver, Washington, to begin a musical career, recording “[Lumberjack](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson/_/Lumberjack),” which was written by [Leon Payne](http://www.last.fm/music/Leon+Payne). The single sold fairly well, but did not establish a career. Nelson continued to work as a radio announcer in Vancouver and to sing in clubs. He sold a song called “[Family Bible](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson/_/Family+Bible)” for $50; the song was a hit for [Claude Gray](http://www.last.fm/music/Claude+Gray) in 1960, has been covered widely and is often considered a [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel) music classic.      Nelson moved to Nashville in 1960, but was unable to land a record label contract. He did, however, receive a publishing contract at Pamper Music. After [Ray Price](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Price) recorded Nelson’s “[Night Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson/_/Night+Life)” (reputedly the most covered country song of all time; a version of “Night Life” was even recorded by convicted killer and former cult leader [Charles Manson](http://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Manson)), Nelson joined Price’s touring band as a bass player. While playing with Ray Price and the Cherokee Cowboys, many of Nelson’s songs became hits for some of country and [pop](http://www.last
