Dave Matthews Band was formed in Charlottesville, VA in 1991 by South African native singer and guitarist Dave Matthews, bassist Stefan Lessard, the late LeRoi Moore, who played a wide variety of instruments from the saxophone to the flute, violin player Boyd Tinsley, drummer Carter Beauford, and keyboardist Peter Griesar (who left the band in 1993), all of whom Dave met in Charlottesville. In 1998, the band played shows with keyboardist Butch Taylor, although he was not officially a member of the band. Taylor played with the band for the stadium runs of the 1999 and 2000 summer tours. From May 18th, 2001 on, Taylor was a permanent fixture on stage, and in 2003 was no longer listed as “special guest”. Even though he was never officially part of the lineup, the band recently announced that Butch was leaving the band via their website, and the 2008 summer tour had some of the first shows without Taylor in years. Rashawn Ross has performed at every normal show from 12.13.05 until the present, leading some to believe that he has joined the band, at least semi-permanently. It is also confirmed that Ross was in the studio with the band during the recent sessions. As of early 2009, Ross, long time collaborator Tim Reynolds, and new saxophonist Jeff Coffin are listed as “Touring Members”.      Early 1990s      In the early 1990s, the band established a cult following through relentless touring with weekly stops at Virginia clubs known as Trax and Floodzone, an active taping community, and an independent LP, [Remember Two Things](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/Remember+Two+Things). (Keyboardist Griesar left the band in 1993, shortly before the release of “Remember Two Things”.) After signing to RCA Records, Dave Matthews Band, under the direction of producer Steve Lillywhite, released [Under The Table And Dreaming](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/Under+The+Table+And+ Dreaming) in 1994, a critical and popular smash that firmly established the band’s style of pop-rock with improvisational leanings. Under the Table and Dreaming would be the first of three albums released under Lillywhite’s direction. This was followed by [Crash](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/Crash) (1996). For most of America, Crash was the record that put the Dave Matthews Band on the map. Featuring the hit single “[Crash into Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/_/Crash+into+Me)”, as well as fan-favorites such as “[Two Step](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/_/Two+Step)”, “[Tripping Billies](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/_/Tripping+Billies)”, and the Grammy-winning “[So Much To Say](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/_/So+Much+To+Say)”, Crash would go on to be the band’s best selling album.
