**Queen** were an English rock band originally consisting of four members: vocalist [Freddie Mercury](http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Mercury), guitarist [Brian May](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+May), bass guitarist [John Deacon](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Deacon), and drummer [Roger Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Taylor).      The band formed in London in 1970 after May and Taylor’s former band [Smile](http://www.last.fm/music/Smile) split after having released an album and single. Freddie replaced lead vocalist [Tim Staffell](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Staffell), after the latter’s departure from the original trio.      There was much deliberation as to what the band’s name would be. May and Taylor had settled upon the Grand Dance, derived from a C.S. Lewis Trilogy of books _Out Of The Silent Planet._      Ultimately, the band went with Queen, a name that was entirely Freddie’s. Originally Roger and, especially, Brian did not like the name, though Mercury would eventually persuade them both that it was “right” for the band.      _”Years ago I thought up the name Queen… It’s just a name, but it’s very regal, and it sounds splendid. It’s a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it. “_   \- Freddie Mercury.      Queen went through several bass players before a young electronics major by the name of John Deacon arrived on the scene in January of 1971.      _”Until John, it had been exploding bass player syndrome. If they musically worked they’d look all wrong, and if they felt all right they couldn’t play._ \- Brian May.      _This quite shy guy turned up with his immaculate Rickenbacker bass and immaculate amplifier, plugged in, and as soon as he started playing we realized it was right._” - Brian May.      Later that year, the band was secured recording time at the newly built De Lane Lea studio, and used the opportunity to record several songs that would later appear on their debut album - [Liar](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Liar), [Keep Yourself Alive](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Keep+Yourself+Alive), [Jesus](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Jesus), and [The Night Comes Down](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/The+Night+Comes+Down). The demo reel was passed around from producer to producer with little success, until a staff member of Trident records by the name of Roy Thomas Baker was introduced to the band by fellow Trident producer John Anthony. Baker dropped in to watch the band at work and, clearly liking what he heard, recommended Queen to his superiors.      It was eventually agreed upon that the fledgling band could record at Trident studios, though after already-established artists had finished their work, such as the likes of Elton John and David Bowie
