The members of Orgy — Jay Gordon (vocals), Amir Derakh (guitar-synths), Ryan Shuck (guitar), Paige Haley (bass), and Bobby Hewitt (drums) — have described their music as “Death Pop” in the past, but few agree on what to call their blend of rock, metal and electronica.      The band was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1997 and signed to [Korn](http://www.last.fm/music/Korn)’s Elementree record label soon after. They quickly released their first album, “Candyass.” Soon after, they performed the duty of opening act on the Family Values tour in ‘98, where they were introduced to many for the first time. Around then, they had their first hit with a cover of [New Order](http://www.last.fm/music/New+Order)’s [Blue Monday](http://www.last.fm/music/New+Order/_/Blue+Monday), followed with successful singles for [Stitches](http://www.last.fm/music/Orgy/_/Stitches) and [Fiction (Dreams In Digital)](http://www.last.fm/music/Orgy/_/Fiction+\(Dreams+In+Digital\)). After the release of their second album, “Vapor Transmission”, they left Elementree records, and largely disappeared from the public eye.      Bobby briefly joined [Snake River Conspiracy](http://www.last.fm/music/Snake+River+Conspiracy) for a while, and Jay formed his own independent record label, D1 Music, with his father. In 2004, Orgy’s third album, “Punk Statik Paranoia,” was released under D1, but with little to no radio play or recognition from the mainstream music media.      Ryan and Amir have also started a side project known as [Julien-K](http://www.last.fm/music/Julien-K), with a much more electronic focus, and have released a song featuring the vocals of [Chester Bennington](http://www.last.fm/music/Chester+Bennington) of [Linkin Park](http://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park) on the recent Underworld Evolution soundtrack. They have since formed the project Dead By Sunrise with Bennington. Amir Derakh was immortalised in the [Coal Chamber](http://www.last.fm/music/Coal+Chamber) song [Amir Of The Desert](http://www.last.fm/music/Coal+Chamber/_/Amir+Of+The+Desert). He produced their debut album. Jay Gordon appeared on the follow up “Chamber Music”.      When asked for an Orgy update in late July 2008, Shuck informed fans that Orgy’s return is still underway but their priority is getting the much delayed Julien-K album released. During a video interview at the annual Californian NAMM 2009 convention, Derakh mentioned a 2010 Orgy reunion.      On March 30, 2010, through a video to his Julien-K, Dead By Sunrise, and Orgy followers, Shuck informed that there are plans for a tour in 2010. On October 25, 2010, Ryan Shuck and Amir Derakh informed on the Julien-K blog that “As of Oct. 26th we will no longer be part of Orgy. Jay will continue making music without the original members. On October 30, 2010, Jay Gordon released a statement via his official Facebook profile stating that he still owns the Orgy name and wants to continue forth creating new material for the band
