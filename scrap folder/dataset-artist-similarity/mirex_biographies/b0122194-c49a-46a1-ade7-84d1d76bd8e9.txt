John Lee Hooker (Coahoma County, Mississippi, August 22, 1917 – Los Altos, California, June 21, 2001) was a highly influential American blues singer, guitarist and songwriter.      John Lee Hooker could be said to embody his own unique genre of the [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues), often incorporating the [boogie- woogie](http://www.last.fm/tag/boogie-woogie) piano style and a driving rhythm into his masterful and idiosyncratic blues guitar and singing. His best known songs include “[Boogie Chillen](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lee+Hooker/_/Boogie+Chillen)” (1948) and “[Boom Boom](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lee+Hooker/_/Boom+Boom)” (1962).      There is some debate as to the year of John Lee Hooker’s birth, 1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have all been cited, 1917 (the date on his grave marker in Oakland, California) is the one most commonly cited although Hooker himself claimed, at times, 1920.      Hooker was the youngest of the eleven children of William Hooker (1871–1923), a sharecropper and a Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (1875–?).   Hooker and his siblings were home-schooled. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs, with his earliest musical exposure being the spirituals sung in church.   In 1921, his parents separated. The next year, his mother married William Moore, a blues singer who provided John’s first introduction to the guitar (and whom John would later credit for his distinctive playing style). The year after that (1923), John’s natural father died; and at age 15, John ran away from home, never to see his mother and stepfather again.      He was a cousin of [Earl Hooker](http://www.last.fm/music/Earl+Hooker),      Throughout the 1930s, Hooker lived in Memphis where he worked on Beale Street and occasionally performed at house parties. He worked in factories in various cities during World War II, drifting until he found himself in Detroit in 1948 working at Ford Motor Company. He felt right at home near the blues venues and saloons on Hastings Street, the heart of black entertainment on Detroit’s east side. In a city noted for its piano players, guitar players were scarce. Performing in Detroit clubs, his popularity grew quickly, and seeking a louder instrument than his crude acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.      Though he stuttered slightly in his normal speech, he performed in a half- spoken style that became his trademark. Rhythmically, his music was free, a property common with early acoustic [delta blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/delta%20blues) musicians. His vocal phrasing was less closely tied to specific bars than most [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) singers’. This casual, rambling style had been gradually diminishing with the onset of [electric blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/electric%20blues) bands from Chicago but, even when not playing solo, Hooker retained it in his sound.      Hooker’s recording career began in 1948 with the hit single, “[Boogie Chillen](http://www.last
