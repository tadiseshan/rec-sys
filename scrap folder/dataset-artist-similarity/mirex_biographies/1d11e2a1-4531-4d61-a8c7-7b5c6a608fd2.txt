O’Shea Jackson (born June 15, 1969 in South Central Los Angeles, California), better known as Ice Cube, is an American rapper, actor, producer and film director known for being a member of the controversial rap group [N.W.A](http://www.last.fm/music/N.W.A).      He released his solo debut album, “AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted,” in 1990 to critical and commercial success, although upon its release he was accused of racism and misogyny. He has since released 1991’s “Death Certificate”, 1992’s “The Predator”, 1993’s “Lethal Injection”, 1998’s “War & Peace Vol 1 (The War Disc)”, 2000’s “War & Peace Vol 2 (The Peace Disc)”, 2006’s “Laugh Now, Cry Later”, 2008’s “Raw Footage”, and 2010’s “I Am the West.”      Ice Cube was raised in South Central by his parents, both of whom were employed at UCLA. He began writing raps while attending William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California, most notably “Boyz ‘N Tha Hood”, which later became famous when done by N.W.A in 1986.      Cube and a friend, [Sir Jinx](http://www.last.fm/music/Sir+Jinx), rapped as a partnership called [C.I.A.](http://www.last.fm/music/C.I.A.) at parties hosted by [Dr. Dre](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre). After a brief stint in a group called “[Hbo](http://www.last.fm/music/Hbo)”, Cube showed [Eazy-E](http://www.last.fm/music/Eazy-E) “Boyz ‘N Da Hood,” and the pair, plus Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, The Arabian Prince and [MC Ren](http://www.last.fm/music/MC+Ren), formed N.W.A.      Cube took one year off to earn a degree in architectural drafting in Phoenix in 1987 but returned in time to participate in N.W.A’s debut album, _Straight Outta Compton_. The album attracted much notoriety for the group, from the FBI and concerned citizen and parent groups. Cube did the lead verse for the album’s infamous track “Fuck tha Police.”      Ice Cube left N.W.A due to financial and personality conflicts in 1989. With [Da Lench Mob](http://www.last.fm/music/Da+Lench+Mob) and the [Bomb Squad](http://www.last.fm/music/Bomb+Squad) ([Public Enemy](http://www.last.fm/music/Public+Enemy)’s producers), Cube recorded his debut album in [New York City](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20york). _AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted_ was released in 1990 and was an instantaneous hit as rap’s popularity increased in [mainstream](http://www.last.fm/tag/mainstream) society.      His 1991 follow-up, _Death Certificate_, was even more controversial. A few songs in the album featured Cube’s hate of Uncle Sam and his politics, and a bonus track named “No Vaseline” was a diss to his former N.W.A bandmates. Also that year, he converted to the Nation of Islam. The album was re-released in 2003 with the bonus track “How to Survive in South Central,” originally from the 1991 “Boyz N the Hood” soundtrack
