Marilyn Monroe, (1 June 1926 – 5 August 1962), born Norma Jeane Mortenson but baptized Norma Jeane Baker, was an American actress, singer and model. She was born in Los Angeles, California, U.S.      After spending much of her childhood in foster homes, Monroe began a career as a model, which led to a film contract in 1947. Her early roles were minor, but her performances in The Asphalt Jungle and All About Eve (both 1950) were well received. She was praised for her comedic ability in such films as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, How to Marry a Millionaire and The Seven Year Itch, and became one of Hollywood’s most popular and glamorous performers.      The typecasting of Monroe’s “dumb blonde” persona limited her career prospects, so she broadened her range. She studied at the Actors Studio and formed Marilyn Monroe Productions. Her dramatic performance in William Inge’s Bus Stop was hailed by critics, and she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in Some Like it Hot.      The final years of Monroe’s life were marked by illness, personal problems, and a reputation for being unreliable and difficult to work with. The circumstances of her death, from an overdose of barbiturates, have been the subject of conjecture. Though officially classified as a “probable suicide”, the possibility of an accidental overdose has not been ruled out, while conspiracy theorists argue that she was murdered.      In 1999, Monroe was ranked as the sixth greatest female star of all time by the American Film Institute.      Marilyn’s personal life started at a young age at age of 16 when she firstly married James Dougherty on August 5, 1942 in Brentwood, California.Marilyn had affairs with actor Clark Gable from late December 1942 to late January 1943.
