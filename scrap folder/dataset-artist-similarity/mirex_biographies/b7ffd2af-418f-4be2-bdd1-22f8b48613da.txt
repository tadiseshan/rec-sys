**Nine Inch Nails** is a Cleveland, OH, USA, [industrial rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial%20rock) band that was formed in 1988 by [Trent Reznor](http://www.last.fm/music/Trent+Reznor), the only constant member of the band. He’s generally credited for popularizing the genre known as “[industrial rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial%20rock)” with both his releases and [dark](http://www.last.fm/tag/dark), theatrical music videos.      Born Michael Trent Reznor, he was raised by his maternal grandparents in Mercer, Pennsylvania, USA. Reznor took up piano at the age of five and in high school took up the tuba and saxophone. In the early to mid-[80s](http://www.last.fm/tag/80s), Trent played with various [synthpop](http://www.last.fm/tag/synthpop) and [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) groups such as [Exotic Birds](http://www.last.fm/music/Exotic+Birds) and [Option 30](http://www.last.fm/music/Option+30) before beginning his solo project.      As a member of Exotic Birds, he appeared in the [Michael J. Fox](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+J.+Fox) and [Joan Jett](http://www.last.fm/music/Joan+Jett) film [Light of Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_of_Day). He also was mentioned on local TV as a proponent of [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) music in general. Before the 1989 release of NIN’s first album, ‘_[Pretty Hate Machine](http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails/Pretty+Hate+Machine)_’, he worked for Right Track Studio as a handyman heavily interested in recording technology. Both the name of Reznor’s band and the title of his second single, “[Head Like a Hole](http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails/_/Head+Like+a+Hole)”, came from remarks by [Al Jourgensen](http://www.last.fm/music/Al+Jourgensen) of [Ministry](http://www.last.fm/music/Ministry), Reznor’s biggest influence.      Nine Inch Nails has issued eight major albums, which have generally received both critical and commercial acclaim.
