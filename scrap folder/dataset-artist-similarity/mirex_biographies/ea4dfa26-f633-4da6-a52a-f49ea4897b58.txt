**R.E.M.** were an [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) band formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1980. The band originally consisted of [Michael Stipe](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Stipe) (vocals), [Peter Buck](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Buck) (guitar, mandolin), [Mike Mills](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Mills) (bass, keyboards, vocals) and [Bill Berry](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Berry) (drums, vocals). Berry retired from the band in October 1997 after having suffered a brain aneurysm in 1995.      R.E.M. released its first single, ” [Radio Free Europe](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./_/Radio+Free+Europe) “, in 1981 on the independent record label [Hib-Tone](http://www.last.fm/label/Hib-Tone). The single was followed by the [Chronic Town EP](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Chronic+Town+EP) in 1982, the band’s first release on [I.R.S. Records](http://www.last.fm/label/I.R.S.+Records). In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, [Murmur](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Murmur) , and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single “[The One I Love](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./_/The+One+I+Love) “. The group signed to [Warner Bros.](http://www.last.fm/label/Warner+Bros.) in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.      By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, [Out of Time](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Out+of+Time) (1991) and [Automatic for the People](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Automatic+for+the+People) (1992), which veered from the band’s established sound. R.E.M.’s 1994 release, [Monster](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Monster) , was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a three-piece. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.      On 21 September 2011, after over 30 years together, R.E.M. announced that they had split up.
