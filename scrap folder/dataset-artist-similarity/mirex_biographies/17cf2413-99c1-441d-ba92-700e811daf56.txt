Lionel Leo Hampton (1908–2002), was a U.S. bandleader, jazz percussionist, and vibraphonist.      Hampton was born on 20th April 1908 in Louisville, Kentucky, but moved to Chicago as a child, where he began his career as a drummer. He relocated to Los Angeles to play drums in [Les Hite](http://www.last.fm/music/Les+Hite)’s band. They soon became the house band for Frank Sebastian’s New Cotton Club, a popular L.A. jazz club.      During a 1930 recording date in the NBC studios in L.A., [Louis Armstrong](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Armstrong) discovered a vibraphone. He asked Hampton if he could play it. Hampton, who knew how to play the xylophone, tried it and they agreed to record a few records with Hamp on vibes. Hampton is credited with popularizing the vibraphone as a jazz instrument.      In the mid-1930s, the [Benny Goodman Orchestra](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Benny+Goodman+Orchestra) came to Los Angeles to play the Palomar Ballroom. John Hammond brought Goodman to see Hampton play. Goodman asked Hampton to move to New York City and join Goodman, [Teddy Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Wilson), and [Gene Krupa](http://www.last.fm/music/Gene+Krupa) who’d already formed a [Benny Goodman](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Goodman) Trio within the large band - to expand into the [Benny Goodman Quartet](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Goodman+Quartet). The Trio and Quartet were among the first racially integrated bands to record and play before wide audiences; they were just as well received at Goodman’s famous 1938 Carnegie Hall concert as was the full Goodman band.      While Hampton worked for Goodman in New York, he recorded with several different small groups known as the Lionel Hampton Orchestra as well as assorted small groups within the Goodman band. In the early 40s he left the Goodman organization to form his own touring band.      Hampton’s band fostered the talents of [Illinois Jacquet](http://www.last.fm/music/Illinois+Jacquet), [Dexter Gordon](http://www.last.fm/music/Dexter+Gordon), Ernie Royal, [Jack McVea](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+McVea), [Charlie Mingus](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Charlie+Mingus), [Monk Montgomery](http://www.last.fm/music/Monk+Montgomery), [Wes Montgomery](http://www.last.fm/music/Wes+Montgomery), [Quincy Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Quincy+Jones), [Benny Golson](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Golson), [Fats Navarro](http://www.last.fm/music/Fats+Navarro), [Kenny Dorham](http://www.last.fm/music/Kenny+Dorham), [Clifford Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/Clifford+Brown), [Dinah Washington](http://www.last.fm/music/Dinah+Washington), [Betty Carter](http://www.last.fm/music/Betty+Carter), [Joe Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Williams), Arnett Cobb, Earl Bostic, and John Colianni among many others.
