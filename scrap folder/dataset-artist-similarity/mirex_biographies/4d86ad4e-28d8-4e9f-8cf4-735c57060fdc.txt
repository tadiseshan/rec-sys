**Squarepusher** is a pseudonym of Chelmsford, Essex, England, [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) musician **[Tom Jenkinson](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Jenkinson)** (b. 1975), best known for his experimental [drum and bass](http://www.last.fm/tag/drum%20and%20bass), with a heavy [jazz fusion](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20fusion) influence. A skilled bassist and multi-instrumentalist, **Jenkinson**’s virtuoso playing is a staple of his music and one of the more obvious affiliations with jazz (although his formal arrangements are often as jazz-derived as his playing). His bass style includes melodic fretless playing, high-speed slap bass and intricate chordal work. The project débuted with **_[Conumber E:P](http://www.last.fm/music/Squarepusher/Conumber+E:P)_** (1995, [Spymania](http://www.last.fm/label/Spymania)) and the latest is **_[Ufabulum](http://www.last.fm/music/Squarepusher/Ufabulum)_** (May 2012, [Warp](http://www.last.fm/label/Warp)).      The son of a jazz drummer, **Jenkinson** grew up listening to greats such as **[Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis)**, **[Charlie Parker](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker)** and **[Art Blakey](http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Blakey)**, plus [dub](http://www.last.fm/tag/dub) pioneers [King Tubby](http://www.last.fm/music/King+Tubby) and **[Augustus Pablo](http://www.last.fm/music/Augustus+Pablo)**. He played bass and drums in high school but was frustrated by the limitations of playing with other musicians. Introduced to electronic music through experimental [electro](http: //www.last.fm/tag/electro)-[techno](http://www.last.fm/tag/techno) artists such as [LFO](http://www.last.fm/music/LFO) and **[Carl Craig](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Craig)** as well as the local rave scene, **Jenkinson** soon began assembling these disparate influences into an amalgam of post-bop, avant-garde and progressive jazz with breakbeat techno, making heavy use of the [Amen break](/tag/Amen+break).      **_Conumber E:P_** and another early EP, as Duke Of Haringey, **_[Alroy Road Tracks](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+of+Harringay/Alroy+Road+Tracks)_** (1995, Spymania), were initially disregarded as misplaced perversions of jungle’s more obvious compositional principles. However, they found a ready audience in fans of post-[acid house](http://www.last.fm/tag/acid%20house) experimental listening music. Tracks from these EPs were later compiled onto the album **_[Burningn’n Tree](http://www.last.fm/music/Squarepusher/Burningn%27n+Tree)_**.      His first album, **_[Feed Me Weird Things](http://www.last.fm/music/Squarepusher/Feed+Me+Weird+Things)_** (1996, [Rephlex](http://www.last.fm/label/Rephlex) \- [Richard D. James](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Richard+D.+James)’ label) and from there he progressed to [Warp Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Warp+Records) for the **_[Port Rhombus EP](http://www.last
