**Fatboy Slim** is a pseudonym of **[Quentin Leo Cook](http://www.last.fm/music/Quentin+Leo+Cook)** (b. 31 Jul 1963 in Reigate, Surrey - aka [Norman Cook](http://www.last.fm/music/Norman+Cook)), an English [big beat](http://www.last.fm/tag/big%20beat) musician.      Quentin Leo Cook was educated at Reigate Grammar School. He started a punk fanzine titled Peroxide with his neighbour Andrew Thomas and art student Ian McKay (formerly Laidlaw). Contemporary with his publishing activities, he played drums in [Disque Attack](http://www.last.fm/music/Disque+Attack) (a British new-wave-influenced rock band) for which he later performed lead vocals. At Reigate College he also met Paul Heaton and, at 18, he went to the Brighton Polytechnic to study a BA in English, Politics and Sociology. Although he had begun DJing some years before, it was at this time that he began to develop his skills on the thriving Brighton club scene.      In 1985 Cook’s friend Paul Heaton who lived in Hull had formed a guitar band called The Housemartins. [The Housemartins](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Housemartins)’ bassist had just quit on the eve of their first national tour. Cook had lost interest in the rock scene and could barely play a musical instrument, he agreed to move to Hull to join them. The band soon had a hit single with “Happy Hour”. They also reached number one just before Christmas 1986 with a version of “Caravan of Love” originally a hit the year before for Isley Jasper Isley. However, by 1988 they had split up. Heaton and the band’s drummer Dave Hemingway went on to form The Beautiful South, while Cook moved back to Brighton to pursue his interest in the style of music he preferred. It was at this time that he first started working with young studio engineer Simon Thornton, with whom he continues to make records. All Cook’s records released from that point onwards have involved both of them to varying degrees (Thornton is credited in 2004 as “Executive Producer” for example).      Cook formed [Beats International](http://www.last.fm/music/Beats+International), a loose confederation of studio musicians including vocalists Lindy Layton, Lester Noel, D.J. Baptiste, rapper MC Wildski, and keyboardist Andy Boucher. Their first album, Let Them Eat Bingo, included the number one single, “Dub Be Good to Me”. “Dub Be Good To Me” caused a legal dispute revolving around allegations of infringement of copyright through the liberal use of unauthorised samples: the bassline was a note-for-note lift from The Clash’s “The Guns Of Brixton” and the song also borrowed heavily from the [S.O.S. Band](http://www.last.fm/music/S.O.S.+Band)’s “Just Be Good to Me”. The 1991 follow-up album Excursion on the Version, an exploration of dub and reggae rhythms, failed to repeat the success of its predecessor.      Cook then formed [Freakpower](http://www.last.fm/music/Freakpower), with horn player and singer Ashley Slater
