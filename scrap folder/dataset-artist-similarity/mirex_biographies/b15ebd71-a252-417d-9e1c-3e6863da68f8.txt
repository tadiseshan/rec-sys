**Faith No More** is an [alternative metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20metal) group that formed in San Francisco, California, USA in 1979. Their music combines elements of various different genres, including heavy metal, funk, hardcore punk, progressive, electronica, soul, gospel, film scores, soft rock, R&B, hip hop and jazz, among many others.      Faith No More formed in 1979 under the name Sharp Young Men, and later [Faith No Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+Man). This early incarnation of the band was fronted Mike “The Man” Morris. [Roddy Bottum](http://www.last.fm/music/Roddy+Bottum), [Mike Bordin](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Bordin), and [Billy Gould](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Gould) decided they wanted rid of him, and rather than firing him, all three quit. They changed their name to Faith No More at the suggestion of a friend (as “The Man” was no more). After cycling through a few guitarists, the members recruited [Jim Martin](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Martin). A number of singers passed through, including a brief stint by [Courtney Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Courtney+Love). [Chuck Mosley](http://www.last.fm/music/Chuck+Mosley) became the full time singer and appeared on their first two records. Their best known song from this era is probably “[We Care a Lot](http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+More/_/We+Care+a+Lot)”, which satirized the prevalence of charity-related rock efforts such as [Live Aid](http://www.last.fm/music/Live+Aid) and “We Are the World”.      The band gained a reputation for infighting and friction that sometimes went way beyond the limits of “creative differences.” In a notorious interview in 1987, Mosley claimed that Martin had hit him with a bottle, and there were frequent rumours of physical confrontations between band members. Indeed, in a short history of the band in one issue, the British music newspaper Melody Maker observed that the band’s internal relationships had descended into “pathological hatred”. Bordin in particular seemed to be very much the “whipping boy” of the band and the butt of numerous cruel pranks and practical jokes. It is doubtful that the band would have stayed together had they not been successful after their second album, Introduce Yourself.      Mosley was fired in 1988, and replaced with singer [Mike Patton](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Patton). Patton would prove a more versatile singer than the monotone Mosley. At the time, he was singing with his high school band [Mr. Bungle](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Bungle) (and would continue to do so during his Faith No More years), and dropped out of Humboldt State University to join Faith No More. The group’s first record with Patton, [The Real Thing](http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+More/The+Real+Thing), was a major hit, selling over a million copies and earning the group a grammy.      Patton’s astonishing vocal range was, arguably, the salvation of Faith No More
