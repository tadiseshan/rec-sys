**Mudvayne** is an American [metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/metal) band from Peoria, IL. The musical styles of their first two albums were highly innovative, combining elements of [progressive metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20metal) with [alternative metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20metal) and were considered to be a [math metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/math%20metal) band for this sound, although the band’s later albums changed direction. The band is best recognizable by their strong drumming, complex bass playing, heavy, gruff and usually angered vocals, heavy guitars and riffs, complex time signatures and frequent rhythm changes. Mudvayne sold over 6,000,000 copies worldwide.      Mudvayne’s first album, [L.D. 50](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/L.D.+50), was released in 2000. It received very positive critical acclaim, being most praised for its technical sound, which were uncommon for the rest of the bands in the early 2000s metal scene. The album was #1 at _Top Heatseekers_, and sold over 500,000 copies in its first four months after release (thus certified Gold by the RIAA). “[Dig](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/_/Dig)”, the album’s lead single has won first ever MTV2 Video Music Award. Besides “Dig”, the album’s two other and also highly successive singles, “[Death Blooms](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/_/Death+Blooms)” and “[Nothing to Gein](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/_/Nothing+to+Gein)” paved the way for the album. At that time, the band was recognizable for their somewhat bizarre image. In 2001, the band released a live DVD entitled “(L)ive (D)osage 50”, that was recorded in 2001 in their home town of Peoria. The DVD was also certified Gold by the RIAA, selling over 500,000 copies.      Mudvayne’s sophomore release, [The End of All Things to Come](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/The+End+of+All+Things+to+Come), proved that the band was more than capable of progressing from a highly praised record successfully. The band took a totally different approach to songwriting. The album sounded more compact, with even more progressive elements. This album also received a great echo in the public, and was also certified Gold by the RIAA. The band’s lead single, “[Not Falling](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/_/Not+Falling)”, became an iconic song for the band. On this album, the band changed their image from multicolored face paint to dressing up as aliens, as seen on the video of “Not Falling” and several early shows in 2002. In 2003, with the release of another successful single, [World So Cold](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/_/World+So+Cold), the band abandoned their use of make up. This was the first video that shows band members without any makeup. Shortly after, the band released another live DVD that was recorded on Summer Sanitarium Tour with Metallica and Linkin Park, entitled “All Access to All Things”. On this DVD, Chad Gray’s voice problems were evident
