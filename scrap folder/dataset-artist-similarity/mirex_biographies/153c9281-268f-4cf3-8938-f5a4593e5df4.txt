Soundgarden is a Seattle rock band who helped to define the sound that came to be called [grunge](http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge). Despite starting years earlier, and having a sound that more closely resembled [Black Sabbath](http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath) or [Led Zeppelin](http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin) than their contemporaries, they are considered one of the “big four” of the ’90s Seattle grunge bands, along with [Alice in Chains](http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains), [Nirvana](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana) and [Pearl Jam](http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam).      The band was formed in 1984 by [Chris Cornell](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Cornell) (vocals, and originally drums) and Hiro Yamamoto (bass), to be joined later by [Kim Thayil](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Thayil) (guitar) and Scott Sundquist (drums). Thayil joined the band after moving to Seattle from [illinois](http://www.last.fm/tag/illinois) with Yamamoto and Bruce Pavitt, who would later start [sub pop records](http://www.last.fm/tag/sub%20pop%20records). Scott Sundquist, who left in 1986 to concentrate more on his family, was replaced on drums by [Matt Cameron](http://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Cameron). Yamamoto was replaced by Jason Everman on bass after the release of 1989’s [Louder Than Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Soundgarden/Louder+Than+Love). Jason Everman was quickly replaced by Ben Shepherd, who remained with Soundgarden for the rest of its life-span.      **Break-up**:   Soundgarden disbanded in 1997, following an aborted tour in support of their album [Down on the Upside](http://www.last.fm/music/Soundgarden/Down+on+the+Upside), as a result of increasing tensions within the group. Cornell went on to pursue a solo career, releasing a solo album, [Euphoria Morning](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Cornell/Euphoria+Morning). He subsequently went on to form [Audioslave](http://www.last.fm/music/Audioslave) with former [Rage Against the Machine](http://www.last.fm/music/Rage+Against+the+Machine) members [Tom Morello](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Morello), [Tim Commerford](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Commerford) and [Brad Wilk](http://www.last.fm/music/Brad+Wilk), while Cameron subsequently joined [Pearl Jam](http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam), replacing [Jack Irons](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Irons) on drums.      The band was named after an outdoor art/sound installation called the “[Sound](http://www.seattleoutdoorart.com/show.php?id=35&cat=area&catval=ne) [Garden](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/visualart/hart221.shtml),” located on NOAA property near Seattle’s Magnuson Park, which makes eerie sounds when the wind blows.      Soundgarden would often utilize alternate tunings and odd time signatures in their songs. Many Soundgarden songs were performed in drop D tuning, including “[Jesus Christ Pose](http://www.last.fm/music/Soundgarden/_/Jesus+Christ+Pose)”, “[Outshined](http://www.last
