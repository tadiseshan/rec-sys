**Duran Duran** (named after a character in Roger Vadim’s sci-fi classic, Barbarella) is an [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) [pop rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop%20rock) band that was part of the [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) movement of the [80s](http://www.last.fm/tag/80s) and [90s](http://www.last.fm/tag/90s). Created by [Nick Rhodes](http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Rhodes) (keyboards) and [John Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Taylor) (bass) in Birmingham, England in 1978, it later add took in [Roger Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Taylor) (drums), [Andy Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Taylor) (guitar), and [Simon Le Bon](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Le+Bon) (lead vocals). The band has sold more than 70 million records over their more than 25 years of existence, making them one of the best-selling groups in history.      Their songs are often [vivid](http://www.last.fm/tag/vivid), hook-laden pieces [dance pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/dance%20pop) that have fared well on the radio, but what many remember best about Duran Duran is their iconic music videos. Though many of the videos were tongue-in-cheek, the band has never quite escaped the glamorous and decadent ‘jet set’ image that their early videos projected. Their flashy outfits and strident, [art rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/art%20rock) influenced music showed an immense debt to [70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s) English [glam](http://www.last.fm/tag/glam) artists such as [David Bowie](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie) and [Roxy Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music), yet the band grasped a sense of their own identity and became one of the keystones of the [new romantic](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20romantic) movement.      Their first singer and one of their original founding members was [Stephen Duffy](http://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Duffy), and their original bassist was [Simon Colley](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Colley). Several drummers and guitarists were subsequently tried, as well as a handful of vocalists, after Duffy left Duran Duran early in 1979. The band felt that they had something special with vocalist [Simon Le Bon](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Le+Bon), and the group smashed into the [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) scene shortly afterwards when “[Planet Earth](http://www.last.fm/music/Duran+Duran/_/Planet+Earth)”, their debut single, was released on 2 February 1981.      “[Planet Earth](http://www.last.fm/music/Duran+Duran/_/Planet+Earth)” became an immediate hit in the band’s native U.K., reaching #12 on the U.K. Singles Chart on 21 February, and it did even better in Australia, hitting #8 there. Being Duran Duran’s first Top 10 hit anywhere in the world, the song showed the group’s interest in international stardom. The band’s eponymous debut album came out promptly afterwards in June 1981. ‘_[Duran Duran](http://www.last.fm/music/Duran+Duran/Duran+Duran)_’ hit #3 on the album charts and remained in the U
