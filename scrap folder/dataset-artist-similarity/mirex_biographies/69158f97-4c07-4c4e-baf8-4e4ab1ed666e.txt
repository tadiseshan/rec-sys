**Boards of Canada** are an [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) music duo from Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, formed in 1986 and comprised of brothers Mike Sandison (born 1 June 1970) and [Marcus Eoin](http://www.last.fm/music/Marcus+Eoin) (born 21 July 1971). They have released a number of works, most notably the studio albums _[Music Has the Right to Children](http://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada/Music+Has+the+Right+to+Children)_ (1998), _[Geogaddi](http://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada/Geogaddi)_ (2002), and _[The Campfire Headphase](http://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada/The+Campfire+Headphase)_ (2005) on the pioneering electronic music label [Warp](http://www.last.fm/label/Warp). Their fourth album _[Tomorrow’s Harvest](http://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada/Tomorrow%27s+Harvest)_ was released in June 2013.      Boards of Canada have had an enormous influence on the [ambient](http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient), [downtempo](http://www.last.fm/tag/downtempo) and [idm](http://www.last.fm/tag/idm) scenes. They have frequently made reference to the warm, scratchy, artificial sounds of 1970s television. Indeed, the Sandison brothers admit to being inspired by the documentary films of the National Film Board of Canada, from which they take their name. The duo have recorded a few minor works under the name Hell Interface. Boards of Canada’s music has been used in several CSI episodes and on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim interlude shorts; small bits of their music have been used on the BBC program Top Gear for transitional music.      **Early Boards of Canada (1970s-1995)**      Growing up in a musical family, brothers Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin began playing instruments at a young age. They experimented with recording techniques at around the age of 10, using tape machines to layer cut-up samples of found sounds over compositions of their own. In their teens they participated in a number of amateur bands, however, it wasn’t until 1986 when Marcus was invited to Mike’s band that Boards of Canada was born.      By 1989, the band had been reduced to Sandison, Eoin and Christopher Horne. In the early 1990s, a number of collaborations took place and the band put on small, fairly regular shows among the “Hexagon Sun” collective.      In early 2000, the official website for the band, Music70.com (now boardsofcanada.com) removed the early discography of Boards of Canada, although some information has been preserved by fans. Early tape releases by Boards of Canada include “Play by Numbers”, “Acid Memories”, “Hooper Bay”, and the earliest known release by the band is titled “Catalog 3”. None of the material from those days is readily available, and since official Boards of Canada sources ignore the existence of this material, there seems to be little chance for this early material to ever resurface
