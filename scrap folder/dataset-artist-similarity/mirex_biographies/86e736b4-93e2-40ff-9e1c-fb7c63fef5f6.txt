**Barenaked Ladies** (often abbreviated BNL) is a [Canadian](http://www.last.fm/tag/canadian) [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) band currently composed of [Jim Creeggan](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Creeggan), [Kevin Hearn](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Hearn), [Ed Robertson](http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Robertson), and [Tyler Stewart](http://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Stewart), and formerly [Andy Creeggan](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Creeggan) and [Steven Page](http://www.last.fm/music/Steven+Page). Page left the band amicably in February 2009 to pursue solo projects. March 7th, 2009 saw their first show on stage as a foursome in Orlando Florida. Tyler Stewart’s drumset was proudly emblazoned with a “Fantastic 4” logo. In March 2010, they released [All In Good Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/All+In+Good+Time), their first post-Page studio album.      They formed in 1988 in Scarborough, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, and are best known for their hit singles, “[One Week](http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/One+Week)”, “[Pinch Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Pinch+Me)”, “[If I Had $100000 0](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Barenaked+Ladies/_/If+I+Had+00000)” and “[Brian Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Brian+Wilson)”, and for their light-hearted and comedic performance style. Their trademark at live shows is humorous banter between songs, and improvised raps/songs, both of which are staples at almost every concert they perform. Each member of the group is a versatile musician, as there are a lot of varied instruments, and each member (with the exception of drummer Tyler Stewart) has written and sung lead on at least one song for the band.      **Indie origins**      Barenaked Ladies began as the duo of Ed Robertson and Steven Page. The two had gone to school together since Robertson was in the fourth grade (Page was a grade ahead), but were not friends until they ran into each other at a Harvey’s restaurant following a [Peter Gabriel](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel) concert. Each interested to find the other liked Gabriel, they began talking and found they had many of the same tastes. The two became friends, and when Page had an extra ticket to a [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan) concert that no one wanted, he ran into Robertson at a party. The two attended the concert at Exhibition Stadium (most likely on August 29, 1988). It was a period where Dylan’s band was led by [G.E. Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/G.E.+Smith), and Robertson describes the show as “horrible” and “lame”. The two turned to amusing each other, pretending they were [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) critics, inventing histories and comments about the Dylan band. They also made up various band names; one of which was “Barenaked Ladies”
