By most accounts, **George Jones** (born George Glenn Jones September 12, 1931 in Saratoga, Texas, died April 26, 2013, in Nashville, Tennessee), was the finest [vocalist](http://www.last.fm/tag/vocalist) in the recorded history of [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) music. Initially, he was a hardcore [honky tonk](http://www.last.fm/tag/honky%20tonk)er in the tradition of [Hank Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Hank+Williams), but over the course of his career he developed an affecting, nuanced ballad style. In the course of his career, he never left the top of the country charts, even as he suffered innumerable personal and professional difficulties. Only [Eddy Arnold](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+Arnold) had more Top Ten hits, and Jones always stayed closer to the roots of hardcore country.      Jones was born and raised in east Texas, near the city of Beaumont. At an early age, he displayed an affection for music. He enjoyed the gospel he heard in church and on the family’s [Carter Family](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Carter+Family) records, but he truly became fascinated with country music when his family bought a radio when he was seven. When he was nine, his father bought him his first guitar. Soon, his father had Jones playing and singing on the streets on Beaumont, earning spare change. At 16, he ran away to Jasper, TX, where he sang at a local radio station. Jones married Dorothy, his first wife, in 1950 when he was 19 years old. The marriage collapsed within a year and he enlisted in the Marines at the end of 1951. Though the U.S. was at war with Korea, Jones never served overseas — he was stationed at a military camp in California, where he kept singing in bars. After he was discharged, Jones immediately began performing again.      In 1953, Jones was discovered by record producer Pappy Daily, who was also the co-owner of Starday Records, a local Texas label. Impressed with Jones’ potential, Daily signed the singer to Starday. “[No Money In This Deal](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Jones/_/No+Money+In+This+Deal),” Jones’ first single, was released in early 1954, but it received no attention. Starday released three more singles that year, which all were ignored. Jones released “[Why, Baby, Why](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Jones/_/Why,+Baby,+Why)” late in the summer of 1955 and the single became his first hit, peaking at number four. However, its momentum was halted by a cover version by [Webb Pierce](http://www.last.fm/music/Webb+Pierce) and [Red Sovine](http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Sovine) that hit number one on the country charts.      Jones was on the road to success and Daily secured the singer a spot on the Louisiana Hayride, where he co-billed with [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley). Jones reached the Top Ten with regularity in 1956 with such singles as “[What Am I Worth](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Jones/_/What+Am+I+Worth)” and “[Just One More](http://www.last
