**[Foo Fighters](http://www.foofighters.com)** are an American [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band formed by singer/guitarist/drummer [Dave Grohl](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Grohl) in 1995 in Seattle, USA. Grohl formed the group as a one-man project after the dissolution of his previous band [Nirvana](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana) in 1994. Prior to the release of [Foo Fighters](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Foo+Fighters) in 1995, Grohl drafted [Nate Mendel](http://www.last.fm/music/Nate+Mendel) (bass), William Goldsmith (drums) (both of [Sunny Day Real Estate](http://www.last.fm/music/Sunny+Day+Real+Estate) and [The Fire Theft](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Fire+Theft)), and [Pat Smear](http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Smear) (guitar) (of [The Germs](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Germs)) to complete the group. Goldsmith left during the recording of the group’s second album [The Colour and the Shape](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/The+Colour+and+the+Shape) (1997), soon followed by Smear. They were replaced by [Taylor Hawkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Hawkins) and [Franz Stahl](http://www.last.fm/music/Franz+Stahl), respectively, although Stahl left prior to the recording of the group’s third album, [There Is Nothing Left to Lose](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/There+Is+Nothing+Left+to+Lose) (1999).      [Chris Shiflett](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Shiflett) joined as the band’s second guitarist after the completion of [There Is Nothing Left to Lose](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/There+Is+Nothing+Left+to+Lose). The band released its fourth album [One by One](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/One+by+One) in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc [In Your Honor](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/In+Your+Honor) (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and harder-rocking material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album [Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace](http://www.last.f m/music/Foo+Fighters/Echoes,+Silence,+Patience+&+Grace) in 2007. Over the course of the band’s career, three of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album, and all six have been nominated for Grammys. The band’s seventh album [Wasting Light](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Wasting+Light) was released in 2011 and peaked at #1 in several countries.      **Formation and debut album**   [Dave Grohl](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Grohl) joined the band [Nirvana](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana) as the group’s drummer in 1990. In order to occupy himself during tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the band; he said in 1997, “I was in awe of frontman [Kurt Cobain](http://www.last.fm/music/Kurt+Cobain)’s songs. And intimidated. I thought it was best that I keep my songs to myself.” Instead, Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos, and even issued a cassette of some of those songs called Pocketwatch under the pseudonym “Late!” in 1992
