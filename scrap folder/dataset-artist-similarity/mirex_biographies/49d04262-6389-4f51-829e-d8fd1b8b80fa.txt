Deana Kay Carter (born January 4, 1966 in Nashville, Tennessee, USA) is an American singer-songwriter who records country music.      She is the daughter of Fred Carter, Jr. She is known for performing barefoot, saying that it helps her relax enough to sing.         Award-winning singer/songwriter/performer Deana Carter unveils The Chain, her fifth studio record October 9th on Vanguard Records.      Each of the 12 songs on The Chain has a special importance to Deana, who personally chose material that had a great impact on her early life. She took the same care in recruiting collaborators for the project, assembling a group of musicians who influenced her as an artist — none more greatly than her father, legendary session player Fred Carter, Jr, who performs throughout the album. “Ever since I knew that music was going to be my life’s path, I’ve wanted to pay tribute to my dad and to the artists who were so good to me and my family. The camaraderie between them, and the way they took our family and made it part of their families, was so unique that I wanted to recapture it for a little while,” states Deana.      The Chain features duets with Deana and some of country music’s royalty: Kris Kristofferson (Help Me Make It Through The Night), Dolly Parton (Love Is Like A Butterfly), Jessi Colter (I’m Not Lisa), Willie Nelson (On The Road Again), George Jones (He Thinks I Still Care) and John Anderson (Swingin’). The CD also includes two of music’s rising stars, Shooter Jennings on “Good Hearted Woman”, the song made famous by his father, the great Waylon Jennings, and Harper Simon on “The Boxer,” a nod to his dad, Paul Simon who plays guitar on this track. The Chain also features stunning solo recordings of Deana performing such classics as “Lay Lady Lay”, “The Weight”, “Crying” and “Old Man”.      Produced and arranged by Deana Carter, The Chain is a musical feast and celebration of one’s past and influences.   A multi-platinum recording artist, Deana Carter burst into the music scene with the blockbuster album Did I Shave My Legs for This? (1996) that produced four No. 1 hit singles. Her additional releases included Everything’s Gonna Be Alright, Father Christmas, I’m Just A Girl, Greatest Hits and The Story Of My Life. She has performed on countless television shows and network specials and yielded a Golden Globe and Grammy nomination for the song Once Upon A December from the animated film Anastasia.   Deana is based in Los Angeles where she resides with her son, Gray Hayes. She is a spokesperson for the National Kidney Foundation.
