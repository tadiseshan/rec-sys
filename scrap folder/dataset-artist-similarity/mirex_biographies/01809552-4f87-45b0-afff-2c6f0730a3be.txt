**Elvis Aaron Presley** (Tupelo, Mississippi, January 8, 1935 - Memphis, Tennessee, August 16, 1977), was an American singer, song producer and actor. A cultural icon, he is widely known by the single name Elvis.       Elvis Presley began his music career at [Sun Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Sun+Records) in the spring of 1954 when [Sam Philips](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sam+Philips) recorded Elvis performing several of Elvis’ favorite songs with [Scotty Moore](http://www.last.fm/music/Scotty+Moore) (guitar) and [Bill Black](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Black) (bass). One of these covers was a country and western song, “[Blue Moon of Kentucky](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/Blue+Moon+of+Kentucky)”.   Elvis is the best-selling solo artist of all time in the United States with confirmed 189.2 million records in RIAA shipments.      Before [Sam Philips](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sam+Philips) sold Elvis’ contract to [rca victor](http://www.last.fm/label/rca+victor) in 1956 for $35,000 they had recorded six two-sided singles. Each of these recordings featured a [country and western](http://www.last.fm/tag/country%20and%20western) song on one side and a [rhythm and blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/rhythm%20and%20blues) song on the other. One of the reasons Elvis was so popular was because of his ability to merge attributes of what was perceived to be “white” (C&W) and “black” (R&B) music. An example of this is evident in Elvis’ hit song “[Heartbreak Hotel](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/Heartbreak+Hotel)” which reached #1 not only in the [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) charts, but the R&B and C&W charts as well. This was the first time that a single song held the #1 spot in all three charts.      Elvis remains a popular and enigmatic star. His legend has only grown stronger since his death. In fact, there is a widespread belief that Elvis—who was known by his first name—did not die in 1977. Many fans persist in claiming he is still alive, that he went into hiding for various reasons. This claim is allegedly backed up by thousands of so-called Elvis sightings that have occurred in the years since his death, and by the fact that his middle name Aron was misspelled Aaron, with two As, on his tombstone.      During an active recording career that spanned more than two decades, Presley set and broke many records for both concert attendance and sales. Some of those records have since been matched and/or broken by other artists, but some of his records will probably remain unbroken and/or unmatched forever. He has had more than 120 singles in the US top 40, across various musical genres, with over 20 reaching number one.      Elvis Aaron (sometimes spelled Aron) Presley, in the humblest of circumstances, was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child
