Rammstein is a German metal band which was formed in 1994, in Berlin, and consists of [Till Lindemann](http://www.last.fm/music/Till+Lindemann) (lead vocals), [Richard Kruspe](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Kruspe) (lead guitar and backing vocals), [Paul Landers](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Landers) (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), [Oliver Riedel](http://www.last.fm/music/Oliver+Riedel) (bass guitar, “Ollie”), [Christoph Schneider](http://www.last.fm/music/Christoph+Schneider) (drums and Electronic percussion, “Doom”) and [Christian Lorenz](http://www.last.fm/music/Christian+Lorenz) (keyboards, “Flake”). The band is widely accepted as part of the Neue Deutsche Härte scene, alongside bands such as [Oomph!](http://www.last.fm/music/Oomph!), [Laibach](http://www.last.fm/music/Laibach), and [Die Krupps](http://www.last.fm/music/Die+Krupps). Their songs are performed almost exclusively in German. They have sold over 22 million records worldwide. Rammstein’s entire catalogue is published by [Universal](http://www.last.fm/label/Universal) Music Group. Since its formation, Rammstein has had no changes in lineup.   Although the majority of their songs are written in German, Rammstein has had success across the world.      **Name**      Rammstein takes its name indirectly from the West German town of Ramstein- Miesenbach, the site of the flight show disaster on August 28, 1988. The band’s signature song, the eponymous Rammstein, is a commemoration of the tragedy that took place at the Ramstein Air Base. The extra “m” in the band’s name makes it translate literally as “ramming stone” to convey the Teutonic sound of their music. In a short period before the band became well known, they performed using the name “Rammstein-Flugschau” (literally meaning Rammstein-Airshow.)      **Formation**      Rammstein was founded by guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe. In 1989, he escaped to West Berlin and started the band, [Orgasm Death Gimmick](http://www.last.fm/music/Orgasm+Death+Gimmick). At that time, he was heavily influenced by American music, especially that of [Kiss](http://www.last.fm/music/Kiss). After the Berlin Wall came down, he moved back home to Schwerin where Till Lindemann worked as a basket weaver and played drums in the band [First Arsch](http://www.last.fm/music/First+Arsch) (loosely translated as “Apex Ass”). At this time, Richard lived with Oliver Riedel, of the band [The Inchtabokatables](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Inchtabokatables), and Christoph “Doom” Schneider (of [Die Firma](http://www.last.fm/music/Die+Firma)). Richard realized that the music he had previously created did not properly suit him. He envisioned something that would combine machines as well as the sound of hard guitars. The three started working together on a new project. Richard soon found it extremely difficult to write both music and lyrics at the same time, so he persuaded Lindemann to join Rammstein
