The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, [Pablo Honey](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Pablo+Honey) (1993). Radiohead’s popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, [The Bends](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+Bends) (1995). The band’s textured guitar parts and Yorke’s falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans.      **International success (1996 - 2000)**   Radiohead’s third album, [OK Computer](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer) (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, [OK Computer](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer) has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s.      **A change in style and leaving EMI (2000 – 2003)**   [Kid A](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Kid+A) (2000) and [Amnesiac](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Amnesiac) (2001) marked a change in the band’s musical style. Radiohead incorporated [experimental](http://www.last.fm/tag/experimental) [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) music, [krautrock](http://www.last.fm/tag/krautrock), [post- punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/post-punk) and [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) influences into their songs, dividing fans and critics, but they remained popular. [Hail to the Thief](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Hail+to+the+Thief) (2003), a mix of guitar-driven [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock), [electronics](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronics) and lyrics inspired by headlines, was the band’s final album for their major record label, EMI.      **Independent releases and touring (2005 - 2013)**   In 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, [In Rainbows](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/In+Rainbows), originally as a digital download for which each customer could set their own price, later in stores, to critical and chart success.      In 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, [The King of Limbs](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+King+of+Limbs) \- again independently - which was described as an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures
