[Mike Paradinas](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Paradinas) is **µ-Ziq**, pronounced, simply, “music”. He has released music under various appellations, among them “[Jake Slazenger](http://www.last.fm/music/Jake+Slazenger)” “[Kid Spatula](http://www.last.fm/music/Kid+Spatula)” “[Gary Moscheles](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Moscheles)”, “[Tusken Raiders](http://www.last.fm/music/Tusken+Raiders)” and “[Rude Ass Tinker](http://www.last.fm/music/Rude+Ass+Tinker)”, and under his primary moniker as µ-Ziq has collaborated with one of the most visible leaders of the modern [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) movement, Richard D. James ([Aphex Twin](http://www.last.fm/music/Aphex+Twin)) on the album Mike & Rich - Expert Knob Twiddlers.      µ-Ziq also owns and runs the electronic label [Planet µ](http://www.planet- mu.com/), which hosts a number of [electronic music](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic%20music) artists. Paradinas shows an uncanny knack at spotting the most innovative and interesting electronic acts from around the world, signing new talents such as [Venetian Snares](http://www.last.fm/music/Venetian+Snares), [Vex’d](http://www.last.fm/music/Vex%27d) and [Chevron](http://www.last.fm/music/Chevron). These days the label is moving in a dubstep direction and has arranged a cd from Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne “Flower” Hobbes      **Planet µ** soars to new heights, and many argue that it has taken Warp’s place in the drivers seat in terms of innovation and forward-thinking in electronic music. The label has taken a darker turn, with the rising popularity of [gabba](http://www.last.fm/tag/gabba), [breakcore](http://www.last.fm/tag/breakcore) and [dubstep](http://www.last.fm/tag/dubstep).
