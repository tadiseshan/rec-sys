Soul Asylum is an [american](http://www.last.fm/tag/american) [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) band formed in the summer of 1981 by Minneapolis high school friends Dan Murphy, Karl Mueller, and [Dave Pirner](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Pirner). The band (named [Loud Fast Rules](http://www.last.fm/music/Loud+Fast+Rules) up until 1984) quickly became frontrunners of American college rock, following in the tradition of fellow Minnesota bands [Hüsker Dü](http://www.last.fm/music/H%C3%BCsker+D%C3%BC) and [The Replacements](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Replacements).      Landing their first record deal with Twin/Tone in 1984, Soul Asylum recorded a total of four albums for the local label: Say What You Will… Everything Can Happen in 1984 (later reissued as [Say What You Will, Clarence… Karl Sold the  Truck](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Say+What+You+Will,+Clarence...+Kar l+Sold+the+Truck)), [Made to Be Broken](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Made+to+Be+Broken) in 1986, [While You Were Out](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/While+You+Were+Out) in 1986, and the EP [Clam Dip And Other Delights](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Clam+Dip+And+Other+Delights) in 1988. The band then switched to A&M, releasing [Hang Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Hang+Time) in 1988 and [And The Horse They Rode In On](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/And+The+Horse+They+Rode+In+On) in 1990 under that label. Although they enjoyed some success as a live band, Soul Asylum suffered from low album sales and considered disbanding.      In 1992, they signed with Columbia Records to produce [Grave Dancers Union](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Grave+Dancers+Union), a record that would come to transform them from underground college rockers to international superstars. The first two singles off the album, [Somebody to Shove](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/_/Somebody+to+Shove) and [Black Gold](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/_/Black+Gold), both came in at high positions at the Modern Rock and Album Rock charts, but it was the album’s third track and it’s video of missing teens that led them to their major breakthrough. [Runaway Train](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/_/Runaway+Train) peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100, raised album sales to double-platinum level, and won Soul Asylum the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song in 1994.      In 1995, Soul Asylum followed up the success of Grave Dancers Union with [Let Your Dim Light Shine](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Let+Your+Dim+Light+Shine), which climbed to #6 on the Billboard 200 and featured the #1 Modern Rock track [Misery](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/_/Misery). After releasing [Candy From A Stranger](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Candy+From+A+Stranger) in 1998, the band members took a break from recording and didn’t release a new studio album for the better part of seven years.
