He has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. He has also released music under the names [Voodoo Child](http://www.last.fm/music/Voodoo+Child), [Barracuda](http://www.last.fm/music/Barracuda), [U.H.F.](http://www.last.fm/music/U.H.F.), [The Brotherhood](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Brotherhood), [DJ Cake](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Cake), [Lopez](http://www.last.fm/music/Lopez), [On the Rim of the Wheel a Nail](http://www.last.fm/music/On+the+Rim+of+the+Wheel+a+Nail), and [Brainstorm/Mindstorm](http://www.last.fm/music/Brainstorm%2FMindstorm).      Moby plays keyboards, guitar and bass guitar. He took his performing name from the novel [Moby-Dick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick) by [Herman Melville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville), who is his great- great-granduncle. His work, while focused in general on various forms of [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) music, have explored many other styles.      **Early years**      Moby used to be in a [punk rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk%20rock) band called the [Vatican Commandos](http://www.last.fm/music/Vatican+Commandos), which was formed in 1980. The group evolved away from punk in 1989 for [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) music. He realized his music tastes and growth were going in a different direction than his previous band’s vibe, and he broke off on his own.      His first album “_The Story So Far (aka Moby)_” featured the single “Go”, which gained popularity in many discos, and earned a spot on the [UK](http://www.last.fm/place/united%20kingdom) charts. The song is so popular that Moby still plays “Go” regularly in his sets. “Go” is a [progressive](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive) track using the string line from “Laura Palmer’s Theme” from the TV drama [Twin Peaks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks).      **1994-1998**      His first album for the UK based MUTE Records was _Everything Is Wrong_ (which had US distribution via Elektra) , which earned early critical praise and minor [commercial](http://www.last.fm/tag/commercial) success. He followed that up with a [hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock)/electronic album called _Animal Rights_ in 1996. In 1997, he released _I Like to Score_, a collection of music included in movies. Among those tracks was an updated version of the [James Bond theme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_Theme) used for the [James Bond](http://en.wikipedia
