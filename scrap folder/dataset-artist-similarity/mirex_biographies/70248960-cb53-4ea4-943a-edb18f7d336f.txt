**Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen** (born September 23, 1949 in Freehold, New Jersey, United States) is an American songwriter, singer, and guitarist. With a recording career stretching back to 1966 that continues to this day, he’s recorded multiple award-winning studio albums and toured constantly, inspiring generations of [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) and [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) musicians. He’s often known as “The Boss”.       He has frequently played as [Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen+&+The+E+Street+Band). Most widely known for his brand of [heartland rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/heartland%20rock) infused with [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) hooks, poetic lyrics, and [americana](http://www.last.fm/tag/americana) sentiments, he often sings songs centered around his native New Jersey. Initially inspired by the tuneful songwriting of [british invasion](http://www.last.fm/tag/british%20invasion) music as well as the vocal swagger of [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley), his eloquence in expressing ordinary, everyday problems has earned him numerous awards, including twenty Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, along with a notoriously dedicated and devoted global fan base. He has sold over 70 million releases in the U.S. alone.      Springsteen’s lyrics often concern men and women struggling to make ends meet. In this sense he was sometimes compared to [Woody Guthrie](http://www.last.fm/music/Woody+Guthrie) and other popular [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) artists. He has gradually become more and more identified with progressive politics, particularly working-class pride. Springsteen is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, on which his album _[The Rising](http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/The+Rising)_ reflects.      Springsteen’s recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll) albums, often inspired by contemporary [pop rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop%20rock), and somber [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk)-oriented works. Much of his iconic status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band present intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, among which Springsteen intersperses long, whimsical tales or deeply emotional stories alongside numerous jokes and asides.      Springsteen has long had the nickname “The Boss,” a term which he was initially reported to dislike but now seems to have come to terms with, as he sometimes jokingly refers to himself as such on stage. The nickname originated when a young Springsteen, playing club gigs with a band in the 1960s, took on the task of collecting the band’s nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates
