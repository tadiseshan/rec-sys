He is more commonly known by a variety of stage names including Jay-Z, S. Carter, Jigga, Hova, J-Hova, Hov, and Young Hov.

He is one of the most respected rappers in the music industry, and is admired for his ability to craft songs from memory without the use of pen and paper.

He is one of the founders of Roc-A-Fella Records, a hip-hop record label which also launched the careers of artists such as [Beanie Sigel](http://www.last.fm/music/Beanie+Sigel), [Kanye West](http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West), [Memphis Bleek](http://www.last.fm/music/Memphis+Bleek), [Young Gunz](http://www.last.fm/music/Young+Gunz), [Freeway](http://www.last.fm/music/Freeway), and [Teairra Mari](http://www.last.fm/music/Teairra+Mari).      **Early history**   Originally from the infamous Marcy Houses projects in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in [brooklyn](http://www.last.fm/tag/brooklyn) in New York City, Shawn Carter was abandoned by his father Adnes Reeves when he was only twelve years old and he was consequently raised by his mother Gloria Carter. Jay-Z attended George Westinghouse High School in Downtown Brooklyn and Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey but did not graduate. He claims to have been caught up in selling drugs on the streets of New York in the Marcy Projects. In addition to this, Jay-Z has lyrically alluded to having sold crack cocaine and marijuana in Virginia and Maryland.      According to his mother, a young Jay-Z used to keep his siblings up at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. Eventually, she bought him a boombox for his birthday and thus sparked his interest in music. He began freestyling, writing rhymes, and followed the music of many artists popular at the time.      In his neighborhood, Carter was known as “Jazzy,” a nickname which eventually developed into his stage name, “Jay-Z.” The moniker is also a homage to his musical partner [Lee Dub](http://www.last.fm/music/Lee+Dub) ([www.soundclick.com/kingdeezy](http://www.soundclick.com/kingdeezy)) [Jaz-O](http://www.last.fm/music/Jaz-O) (a.k.a.
