House of Pain was an Irish-styled American [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag /hip-hop) group who released three albums in the early to mid 90’s before lead rapper [Everlast](http://www.last.fm/music/Everlast) decided to pursue his solo career again. The group is best known for its 1992 hit single [Jump Around](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain/_/Jump+Around).      The band’s history starts with a failed short solo career, Everlast teamed up with [DJ Lethal](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Lethal) and high school friend Danny Boy to form House of Pain. The group was signed to Tommy Boy Records, and their self-titled debut album (1992) went multi-platinum, spawning the successful [DJ Muggs](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Muggs) produced single [Jump Around](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain/_/Jump+Around).      Fashioning themselves as rowdy Irish-American hooligans (Lethal is actually of Latvian heritage), they toured with various rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough. They participated together with Helmet, along with several other rap acts, on the influential 1993 rock-rap collaborative Judgement Night movie soundtrack.      Sophomore album and decline in popularity      Their follow-up effort, 1994’s Same As It Ever Was, went gold despite minimal airplay and no major hits. The first single, “On Point,” is noted for taking a swipe at another American rapper with a strong Irish heritage, Mark Wahlberg (“Calvin Klein’s no friend of mine/So I don’t like Marky”). Like [Cypress Hill](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill), who, with House of Pain, were a part of the loosely-affiliated Soul Assassins posse, they found urban radio airplay an increasingly closed path, which affected album sales.      Third album      House of Pain abruptly broke up in 1996 after the release of their third album, Truth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again, which featured guest appearances by rappers Sadat X of Brand Nubian, Guru of Gang Starr, producer/rapper Divine Styler and reggae singjay Cockni O’Dire (credited as the Scheme Team). On the release date of the album, Everlast announced his departure from the group.      Split, solo and current affairs      From this point on, the status of the group would seem to be in the past tense, though the members would continue their careers separately. Danny Boy would found an art company, DJ Lethal became a member of nu metal band Limp Bizkit, and Everlast would finally get multi-platinum solo fame in 1998. In that year his acoustic rock/blues-inflected Whitey Ford Sings the Blues album hit the charts, together with the single “What It’s Like”. In 2000, a feud between Everlast and rapper Eminem coincided with the gold-selling Eat at Whitey’s, which had minor hits like “Black Jesus” and “Black Coffee”, and featured a collaboration with Carlos Santana.
