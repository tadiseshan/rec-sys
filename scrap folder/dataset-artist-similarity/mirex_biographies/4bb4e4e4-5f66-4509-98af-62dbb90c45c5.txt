There are 2 acts by the name of Disturbed;      1) Well-known American hard rock band with lead singer David Michael Draiman, formed in 1996, with several albums including The Sickness (Giant/Reprise 2000), Believe (Giant/Reprise 2002), Ten Thousand Fists (Reprise, 2005), Indestructible (Reprise, 2008) and Asylum (Reprise, 2010).      2) Late 80’s American Thrash band who released the album Disturbing the Peace in 1988; formed by Earl Root in 86/87 and disbanded in 92/93 before his death in 2008.      1) Disturbed was formed in 1996 when musicians Dan Donegan, Steve Kmak, and Mike Wengren hired singer David Draiman in Chicago, Illinois. They have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, and released four consecutive #1 debuts a feat achieved by only two other rock bands in the history of the chart: [Metallica](http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica) and [Dave Matthews Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band). Originally classified as a nu metal band, Disturbed is now regarded by some music critics as [hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock) or [heavy metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/heavy%20metal), although others now regard them as [nu metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/nu%20metal). However, the band’s genre is still being debated. When asked about die-hard metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, frontman David Draiman stated:      _”We probably have too much melody going on or we’re not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it’s not what we try to do. If we have to place things in context, we’re more hard rock than heavy metal these days.”_      **Early Days, The Sickness**   In their early years, Disturbed started recording several demos and played live shows. Not long after, in 2000, the band released their debut album, titled [The Sickness](http://www.last.fm/music/Disturbed/The+Sickness), which launched the band into stardom.
