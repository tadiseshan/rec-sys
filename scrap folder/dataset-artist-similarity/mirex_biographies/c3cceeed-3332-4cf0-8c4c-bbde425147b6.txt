Scorpions is a hard rock/heavy metal band from Hannover, Germany, best known for their 1984 rock anthem “Rock You Like a Hurricane” and their singles “Wind of Change”, “No One Like You”, “Still Loving You”, and “Send Me an Angel”. The band has sold over 100 million records worldwide. Along with [Metallica](http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica), [Iron Maiden](http://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden), [AC/DC](http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC), [Kiss](http://www.last.fm/music/Kiss), [Aerosmith](http://www.last.fm/music/Aerosmith), [Ozzy Osbourne](http://www.last.fm/music/Ozzy+Osbourne) and [Deep Purple](http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple) they are one of the most successful hard rock/heavy metal acts and by far the most successful German Rock band in America and England. Rudolf Schenker, the band’s rhythm guitarist, explained in an [interview with Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7230): “In the beginning of our career, we had a problem in Germany because nobody expects a German band to play Rock music. With Rock music, there are more bands from England or America, which are more exotic than the Scorpions, who are from Germany. But when we went to America in ‘79, we became the exotic ones. They said, ‘Hey, what kind of crazy guys are these?’ (laughs) We were already exotic, with a different view, and we also play our Rock music with a little bit of an ethnic touch. You’ll notice that Americans come from the blues side, whereas we come from the classical side, which is different.”      \+ The “Scorps” known to metal heads of the time, reminisce more of Lonesome Crow · Fly to the Rainbow · In Trance · Virgin Killer · Taken by Force · Lovedrive · Animal Magnetism. Only after the commercial success of “Blackout” did they start to get heavily pushed into the mainstream media of the U.S. market by Mercury records. Wind of change and Rock you like a Hurricane pushed The Scorps into the Limelight because of the heavy MTV push to please young rockers of the time.   \+   \+ Rock you like a Hurricane was overplayed by MTV because RCA wouldn’t let MTV have any of Scorpions old videos. MTV was the no mans land. They had no money to buy a big video collection of any artists and the owners of MTV got no money/backing of any big studio.   \+   \+ The consensus of the time thought MTV wouldn’t hold a dime to to the already popular television/music shows of the time “Midnight Special, Hee Haw, Soul Train and American Bandstand” and would fade away into the history books.   \+   \+ **Song Origin,**   \+   \+ The song “Rock You Like a Hurricane” was created because Klaus Meine and the band wanted a song that thanked all his fans and the song was a reminder to the band of how all the Scorpions world wide fans made them feel. Hence the name “Rock You Like a Hurricane”   \+   \+ **Formation and early history (1965-1973)**   \+   \+ Rudolf Schenker set out to find a band in 1965
