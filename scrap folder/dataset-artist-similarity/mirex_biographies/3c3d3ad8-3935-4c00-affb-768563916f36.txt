**Fluke** are an [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) band formed in 1988 at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, UK, by Mike Bryant, Jon Fugler and Mike Tournier. The group are noted for their diverse range of electronic styles spanning the [house](http://www.last.fm/tag/house), [techno](http://www.last.fm/tag/techno), [ambient](http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient) and [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) genres.      Fluke started out making dreamy pop before the explosion of acid house influenced them. It was the growing electronica sound that influenced their early singles ([Thumper](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/_/Thumper), [Joni](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/_/Joni), [Slid](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/_/Slid)) and their techno-rock debut album _[The Techno Rose of Blighty](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/The+Techno+Rose+of+Blighty)_ (1991). In the same year they released a live album entitled _[Out (In Essence)](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/Out+\(In+Essence\))_.      Fluke signed with Virgin for their next albums _[Six Wheels On My Wagon](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/Six+Wheels+On+My+Wagon)_ (1993) and _[Oto](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/Oto)_ (1995), which proved Fluke to be a driving force in the progressive house and trip-hop scenes. This era provided singles like [Electric Guitar (Humbucker)](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/_/Electric+Guitar+\(Humbucker\)), [Groovy Feeling (Make Mine a 99)](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/_/Groovy+Feeling+\(Make+Mine+a+99\)), [Bubble (Speechbubble)](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/_/Bubble+\(Speechbubble\)), [Bullet](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/_/Bullet) and [Tosh](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/_/Tosh).      Their fourth studio album _[Risotto](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/Risotto)_ was a runaway success in 1997 and 1998, powered by the big-beat songs [Atom Bomb](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/_/Atom+Bomb) and [Absurd](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/_/Absurd). After enjoying worldwide touring for several years, Fluke took time off to expand their already-massive remixography, releasing the retrospective _[Progressive History X](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/Progressive+History+X)_ in 2001, followed by _[Progressive History XXX](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/Progressive+History+XXX)_ in 2002.      Their newest and most mature album, _[Puppy](http://www.last.fm/music/Fluke/Puppy)_, followed in mid-2003, this time incorporating Jon Fugler and Mike Bryant only, while Mike Tournier concentrated on his own band [Syntax](http://www.last.fm/music/Syntax) together with vocalist Jan Burton.      Bryant and Fugler are currently working on the electronica project [2 Bit Pie](http://www.last.fm/music/2+Bit+Pie) along with Jan Burton and other musicians who released their first album _[2 Pie Island](http://www.last.fm/music/2+Bit+Pie/2+Pie+Island)_ in 2006.
