**Tina Turner** (born Anna Mae Bullock on 26 November 1939, Nutbush, Tennessee, USA) is a Grammy-winning multi-platinum rock/soul, r&b/pop singer, songwriter, actress, and author. She is the most successful female rock artist of all time: **the Acid Queen** or **The Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll**. She started her storied career by joining [Ike Turner](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+Turner) to form The [Ike & Tina Turner](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+&+Tina+Turner) Revue in 1960. They had a string of hits like [A Fool In Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+&+Tina+Turner/_/A+Fool+In+Love), [It’s Gonna Work Out Fine](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+&+Tina+Turner/_/It%27s+Gonna+Work+Out+Fine), a cover of [Creedence Clearwater Revival](http://www.last.fm/music/Creedence+Clearwater+Revival)’s “[Proud Mary](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+&+Tina+Turner/_/Proud+Mary), and the autobiographical [Nutbush City Limits](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+&+Tina+Turner/_/Nutbush+City+Limits) and were widely admired by their audiences and peers.      After her divorce from Ike Turner (he had been abusing her for many years) she took on a solo career in the late 70’s. It wasn’t until 1983, with the release of a cover of [Al Green](http://www.last.fm/music/Al+Green)’s “Let’s Stay Together”, that she proceeded to make one of the greatest comebacks in history of music. Her 5th solo album “Private Dancer” produced numerous hits and earned her four Grammy Awards. In 1985, she starred in “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” beside Mel Gibson and not only gained a NAACP Image Award for her performance as Aunty Entity, but also received a Grammy nomination for “We Don’t Need Another Hero”, a song from the film’s soundtrack. Next, Tina brought her story to the the public through her best-selling biography “I, Tina”, written with Kurt Loder. She followed “Private Dancer” with “Break Every Rule” and “Foreign Affair”. Each album was followed by successful world tours. Tina Turner announced that she would be retiring after the “Foreign Affair” Tour.      Ike and Tina Turner were inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. That same year, she released her first greatest hits CD, “Simply The Best”, which went platinum. In 1993, her life story was made into a motion picture, “What’s Love Got To Do with It.” She helped promote it with remakes of old Ike and Tina numbers. She also recorded three new songs for the film’s soundtrack. Among the new songs was “I Don’t Wanna Fight” which went to #9 on the Billboard charts and was nominated for a Grammy award. She followed the album with an American tour.      Tina Turner came out of retirement to make her first original album in 1995 after the success of her song “Goldeneye” from the James Bond film of the same name. She released “Wildest Dreams” in 1996, became the spokeswoman for Hanes Hosiery, and embarked on yet another world tour that continued into 1997. One would think that at 56 Ms
