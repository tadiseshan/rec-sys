**Pink Floyd** are a [psychedelic](http://www.last.fm/tag/psychedelic)/[progressive rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20rock) band formed in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom in 1965. Pink Floyd is one of [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock)’s most successful and influential acts, having sold over 200 million albums worldwide and with 74.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time. Currently the band consists of David Gilmour (vocals, guitar) and Nick Mason (drums).      The band’s classic lineup was [Roger Waters](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Waters) (vocals, bass), [David Gilmour](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Gilmour) (vocals, guitar), [Rick Wright](http://www.last.fm/music/Rick+Wright) (organ, keyboards, vocals) and [Nick Mason](http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Mason) (drums). Gilmour was brought into the band in 1968 to replace the band’s founder, singer, guitarist and songwriter [Syd Barrett](http://www.last.fm/music/Syd+Barrett), who had become increasingly erratic and departed from the band a few months after Gilmour’s addition. The band became known for their advancements in the genres of psychedelic rock and progressive rock music, philosophical lyrics, [avant- garde](http://www.last.fm/tag/avant-garde) compositions, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art and elaborate live shows.      Pink Floyd enjoyed modest success in the late-1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett. Barrett’s increasingly erratic behavior eventually caused his colleagues to replace him after _[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Piper+at+the+Gates+of+Dawn)_ with guitarist David Gilmour. The band went on to record several elaborate concept albums; achieving worldwide success with 1973’s _[The Dark Side Of The Moon](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Dark+Side+Of+The+Moon)_ (The second best-selling album of all time), 1975’s _[Wish You Were Here](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/Wish+You+Were+Here)_, 1977’s _[Animals](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/Animals)_, and 1979’s _[The Wall](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Wall)_, among the best-selling, most critically acclaimed, and enduringly popular albums in rock music history. In 1985, singer and bassist Roger Waters declared Pink Floyd defunct. However, the remaining members continued recording and touring under the name, eventually reaching a settlement with Waters giving them rights to the name and most of the songs.      Pink Floyd evolved from an earlier band, formed in 1964, which was at various times called Sigma 6, The Meggadeaths, The Screaming Abdabs, and The Abdabs. When this band split up, some members — guitarists Bob Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright — formed a new band called Tea Set, and were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist Syd Barrett, who became the band’s primary vocalist as well
