Bill Monroe (September 13, 1911 – September 9, 1996) developed the style of country music known as bluegrass, which takes its name from his band, the “Blue Grass Boys,” named for his home state of Kentucky. Monroe’s performing career spanned 60 years as a singer, instrumentalist, composer and bandleader. He is often referred to as “the father of bluegrass.”      In the rock (and roll) community, Bill Monroe may be best known via one of Elvis Presley’s earliest recordings at Sun Records, that of Monroe’s ‘Blue Moon of Kentucky’. [Patsy Cline](http://www.last.fm/music/Patsy+Cline) also made a highly regarded version of this song.
