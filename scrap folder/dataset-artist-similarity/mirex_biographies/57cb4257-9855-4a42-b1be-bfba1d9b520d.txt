Howard Andrew Williams (born December 3, 1927 in Wall Lake, Iowa, died September 26, 2012), known as Andy Williams, is an American [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) singer.      He first performed in a children’s choir at his local Presbyterian church. Williams and his three older brothers Bob, Dick, and Don, formed a quartet, [The Williams Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Williams+Brothers), in the late 1930s. The brothers performed on radio in the Midwest, first at WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, and later at WLS in Chicago and WLW in Cincinnati. Williams graduated from Western Hills High School in Cincinnati. They appeared with Bing Crosby on the hit record “Swinging on a Star” (1944). This led to a nightclub act with entertainer Kay Thompson from 1947 to 1951.      Williams’s solo career began in 1952 after his brothers left the act. He recorded six sides for RCA’s label “X,” but none of them were popular hits. After landing a spot as a regular on [Steve Allen](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Allen)’s Tonight Show in 1955, he was signed to a recording contract with Cadence Records, a small label in New York run by conductor Archie Bleyer. His third single, “Canadian Sunset” (1956) hit the Top Ten, and was soon followed his only Billboard #1 hit, “Butterfly” (a cover of a [Charlie Gracie](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Gracie) record on which Williams imitated [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley)). More hits followed, including “The Hawaiian Wedding Song,” “Are You Sincere,” “The Village of St. Bernadette,” and “Lonely Street,” before Williams moved to Columbia Records in 1961, having moved from New York to Los Angeles. In terms of chart popularity, the Cadence era was Williams’s peak although songs he introduced on Columbia became much bigger standards. Two top ten hits from the Cadence era, “Butterfly” and “I Like Your Kind of Love” were apparently believed to not suit Williams’s later style; they were not included on a Columbia reissue of his Cadence greatest hits in the 1960s.      During the 1960s, Williams became one of the most popular vocalists in the country and signed what was to that time the biggest recording contract in history. He was primarily an album artist, and at one time he had earned more gold albums than any solo performer except Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. By 1973 he had earned as many as 17 gold album awards. Among his hit albums from this period were Moon River, Days of Wine and Roses (number one for 16 weeks in mid-1963), The Andy Williams Christmas Album, Dear Heart, The Shadow of Your Smile, Love, Andy, Get Together with Andy Williams, and Love Story. In these recordings Williams displays an incredible vocal technique along with an uncanny ability to make each song his very own, often rivaling or surpassing the version by the original artist
