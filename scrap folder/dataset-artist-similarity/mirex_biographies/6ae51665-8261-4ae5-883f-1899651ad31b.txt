Filter (stylized as FILTER) is an [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) group formed in 1993 in Cleveland, Ohio by Richard Patrick and guitarist/programmer Brian Liesegang, who later left the band in 1997 to form [Ashtar Command](http://www.last.fm/music/Ashtar+Command) with Chris Holmes. Filter has released five studio albums      Their first album, _[Short Bus](http://www.last.fm/music/Filter/Short+Bus)_, was released in 1995. The album was commercially successful, and included the hit single “Hey Man, Nice Shot”. The song was somewhat controversial, as it was seen as capitalizing on the public suicide of Budd Dwyer. [Kurt Cobain](http://www.last.fm/music/Kurt+Cobain)’s suicide was widely rumored to have inspired the song, but the band refuted this. In need of a live band to tour the album, Patrick and Liesegang recruited Geno Lenardo on guitar, Frank Cavanagh on bass, and Matt Walker on drums. They would all later be featured in the video for the album’s second single, “Dose”.      Between Filter’s first and second albums, the band became known for their soundtrack contributions, The first of these tracks, “Thanks Bro”, landed on the _Songs In The Key Of X: Music From And Inspired By The X-Files_ album. In 1996, Filter recorded and filmed the video for the song “Jurassitol”, for _The Crow: City of Angels_ soundtrack. They also released the home video Phenomenology in 1996, which showcased some of the band’s live performances and music videos, as well as an interview with Patrick and Liesegang filmed in New Mexico.      Liesegang left in 1997 shortly after recording the Filter/The Crystal Method collaboration “(Can’t You) Trip Like I Do” for the _Spawn_ movie soundtrack, due to creative differences with Patrick. In 1998, for the _X-Files_ film soundtrack, Patrick decided to keep the Filter name and recorded a cover of [Harry Nilsson](http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Nilsson)’s “One”.      Patrick continued with 1999’s _[Title of Record](http://www.last.fm/music/Filter/Title+of+Record)_ with returning members Lenardo and Cavanagh, as well as Steve Gillis on drums, filling in the gap left by Walker after he left to work with [The Smashing Pumpkins](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smashing+Pumpkins). _Title of Record_ moved away from [industrial rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial%20rock) somewhat, and resulted in the band’s biggest hit, the mellow ballad “Take a Picture”, along with other lesser-heard singles “Welcome to the Fold” and “The Best Things”. The song “Take a Picture” is about a dispute on an aircraft, when Richard Patrick drunkenly stripped down to his boxers, alarming the other passengers.      The song “Captain Bligh” (after Vice-Admiral William Bligh of the HMS Bounty) was written by Patrick after leaving [Nine Inch Nails](http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails) and was about [Trent Reznor](http://www.last.fm/music/Trent+Reznor)’s notoriously anti-social habits
