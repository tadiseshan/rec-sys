**Gorillaz** are a [british](http://www.last.fm/tag/british) virtual band formed in 1998 by [Damon Albarn](http://www.last.fm/music/Damon+Albarn) of [Blur](http://www.last.fm/music/Blur), and [Jamie Hewlett](http://www.last.fm/music/Jamie+Hewlett), co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl. They had the idea to create the band while watching MTV in their London flat and originally intended to call the project _Gorilla_.      The band consists of four fictional band members: 2-D (vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass), Noodle (guitar, vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums). These characters only appear in animated form and are not alter-egos of real people, as is often mistakenly assumed. There is an extensive fictional back- story behind these band members, written by Albarn and Hewlett. Their albums, several of their music videos, and their autobiographical book _Rise Of The Ogre_ all tell the saga. [Damon Albarn](http://www.last.fm/music/Damon+Albarn) is the only permanent musical contributor to the band, which is also a collaboration between various musicians. Their style is broad with a large number of alternative influences including [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock), [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip- hop), and [electronica](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronica).      They have released four studio albums: [Gorillaz](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/Gorillaz) (2001), [Demon Days](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/Demon+Days) (2005), [Plastic Beach](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/Plastic+Beach) (2010) and [The Fall](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/The+Fall) (Also in 2010). Additionally, they have put out two B-side collections, [G-Sides](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/G-Sides) (2001) and [D-Sides](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/D-Sides) (2007), and a reggae remix of the _Gorillaz_ album entitled [Laika Come Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/Laika+Come+Home) (2002). The band has also released three DVDs: _Phase One: Celebrity Takedown_, _Demon Days: Live at Manchester Opera House_, and _Phase Two: Slow Boat To Hades_. At the end of 2010, Gorillaz released their next album, [The Fall](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/The+Fall), which was recorded during their US ‘Escape to Plastic Beach’ tour. It is promoted as being the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website.      The band’s first single, [Clint Eastwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/_/Clint+Eastwood), was released on 5 March 2001. This single was the first of four from [Gorillaz](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/Gorillaz), which was released on 26 March 2001. The other three singles were released over the next year. These were: [19-2000](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/_/19-2000), [Rock the House](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/_/Rock+the+House), and [Tomorrow Comes Today](http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/_/Tomorrow+Comes+Today)
