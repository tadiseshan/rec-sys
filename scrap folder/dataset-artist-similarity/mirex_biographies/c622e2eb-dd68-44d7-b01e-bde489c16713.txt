**Spineshank** is a Los Angeles, CA, USA Grammy-nominated alternative metal band.      Began in February of 1996, rising from the ashes of a previous band, Basic Enigma (which included future Spineshank members Jonny Santos on vocals, Mike Sarkisyan on guitars, and Tom Decker on drums). Basic Enigma broke up but soon reformed with a different sound and moniker, and a new bassist (Robert Garcia).      The band soon befriended Fear Factory guitarist Dino Cazares, who upon hearing their demo, offered the new band to open a show for F.F. at the Whiskey A-Go- Go in Los Angeles. This led to other coveted opening slots (with such popular acts as [Coal Chamber](http://www.last.fm/music/Coal+Chamber), [Snot](http://www.last.fm/music/Snot), [Soulfly](http://www.last.fm/music/Soulfly), [Sepultura](http://www.last.fm/music/Sepultura) and [Danzig](http://www.last.fm/music/Danzig), among others), and label interest, with Roadrunner eventually signing the band. Their debut, [Strictly Diesel](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/Strictly+Diesel), was released in September of 1998, and featured yet another tie-in with their favorite band, Fear Factory vocalist Burton C. Bell sings on the track [Stain](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/_/Stain). [The Height of Callousness](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/The+Height+of+Callousness) followed two years later. Two singles were released off of this album (as well as became available in video form); [Synthetic](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/_/Synthetic) & [New Disease](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/_/New+Disease). The band would hold a second stage slot on Ozzfest 2001 for the majority of that summer as well as touring with the likes of [Disturbed](http://www.last.fm/music/Disturbed), [(hed) p.e.](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/\(hed\)+p.e.), [Orgy](http://www.last.fm/music/Orgy)& [Mudvayne](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne).      2003 saw the release of the much anticipated [Self Destructive Pattern](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/Self+Destructive+Pattern), as well as the single [Smothered](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/_/Smothered).      After the departure of Jonny Santos in 2004, the remaining members searched for a new vocalist and stated earlier in 2005 they have been working with a new vocalist. No name was given and no other news has been reported since then. Jonny Santos has since re-emerged in a new band dubbed [Silent Civilian](http://www.last.fm/music/Silent+Civilian).      After a very long wait, Spineshank updated their official website (11/7/2005) with news that the band had found a new vocalist in Brandon Espinoza and that they had been working together for a month and had recorded 5 songs during this time. The band goes on to say that their new music is: â€œstill heavy and dynamic with melody, but its a little darker and more raw
