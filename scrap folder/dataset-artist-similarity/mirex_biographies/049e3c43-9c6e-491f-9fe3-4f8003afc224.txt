Sean John Combs (born November 4, 1969, New York, New York) is a famous record producer and entertainment mogul who presides over a media empire that includes the record label Bad Boy Entertainment, the clothing lines Sean John and Sean by Sean Combs, a movie production company, and a restaurant chain. He has taken the roles of recording executive, producer, writer, arranger, clothing designer, actor, singer and rapper.      Early years      Combs was born in the public housing projects of the Harlem neigborhood of New York City, the son of Janice and Melvin Combs. He grew up in Mount Vernon. When Combs was a child, his father, aged 33, an associate of Frank Lucas the New York drug lord, was shot dead in his car at a Manhattan park after attending a party. Lucas and rival gangster Nicky Barnes both publicly state that they were close to Melvin.      Combs played football at the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy. He played defense and, in 1986 when he was a senior, his team won a division title. Combs has “fond memories” of his high school buddies, one of whom (the team quarterback) was Andrew Campos, a reputed Gambino crime family enforcer. Combs is not alleged, either in court papers or by law enforcement sources, to have engaged in any wrongdoing in any of his dealings with Campos. He completed his secondary education in 1987.      Combs says he was given the nickname “Puff” as a child because he would “huff and puff” when he was angry,and “Daddy” was another version of “player.”         Uptown Records      Combs attended Howard University in Washington, DC, where he showed a penchant for marketing and gained a reputation as a party promoter. He eventually became an intern at New York’s Uptown Records.[5] For some time he would travel back and forth between Washington and New York, juggling his classes and his internship, before eventually dropping out of Howard when he became a top executive at Uptown. He was instrumental in developing Jodeci and signing and producing Mary J. Blige.      In 1991 Combs promoted a concert, headlined by Heavy D. and held at the City College of New York gymnasium, following an AIDS charity basketball game. The event was overcrowded since it was oversold to almost twice capacity, while thousands without tickets were outside. To keep them out Combs’ people shut the only door to a stairwell and put a table behind it, though the crowd jammed inside was pounding on the door and pleading for help. When the crowd outside broke several glass doors in an attempt to get in a stampede ensued inside the gymnasium in which nine people died. In a 1999 ruling, a Court of Claims judge found Puff Daddy and Heavy D. responsible for 50 percent of the incident. City College bore the rest of the responsibility in part for abandoning security responsibility to Puff Daddy though they knew the event was oversold
