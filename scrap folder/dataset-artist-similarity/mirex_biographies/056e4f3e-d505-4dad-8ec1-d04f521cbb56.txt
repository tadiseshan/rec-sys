The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group [Darlin’](http://www.last.fm/music/Darlin%27) with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The trio had branded themselves after [The Beach Boys](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys) song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition.
