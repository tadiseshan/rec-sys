Kenneth Bruce Gorelick (born June 5, 1956 in Seattle, WA), better known by his stage name **Kenny G**, is a Grammy winning American saxophonist. His fourth album, _[Duotones](http://www.last.fm/music/Kenny+G/Duotones)_, brought him breakthrough success in 1986. Kenny G’s main instrument is the soprano saxophone, but he also on occasion plays alto and tenor saxophone. He started playing the saxophone when he was 10 years old, in 1966.      **Kenny G** has long been the musician many [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) listeners love to hate. A phenomenally successful instrumentalist whose recordings make the [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) charts, Kenny G’s sound has been a staple on adult [contemporary jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/contemporary%20jazz) and [smooth jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/smooth%20jazz) radio stations since the mid-‘[80s](http://www.last.fm/tag/80s), making him a household name. **Kenny G** is a fine player with an attractive sound (influenced a bit by [Grover Washington, Jr.](http://www.last.fm/music/Grover+Washington,+Jr.)) who often caresses melodies, putting a lot of emotion into his solos. Because he does not improvise much (sticking mostly to predictable melody statements), his music largely falls outside of [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz). However, because he is listed at the top of “[contemporary jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/contemporary%20jazz)” charts and is identified with [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) in the minds of the mass public, he is classified as a [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) artist.
