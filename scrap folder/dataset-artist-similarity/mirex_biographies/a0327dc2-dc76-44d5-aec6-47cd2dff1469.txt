**Counting Crows** is an American [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band originating from Berkeley, California. Formed in 1991, the group gained fame in 1993 following the release of their debut album, titled ‘_[August And Everything After](http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows/August+And+Everything+After)_’, when track “[Mr. Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows/_/Mr.+Jones)” became a big hit. Known for their melancholic yet melodic songwriting, the band started when singer Adam Duritz (previously of [The Himalayans](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Himalayans) and [Sordid Humor](http://www.last.fm/music/Sordid+Humor)) teamed up with guitarist David Bryson (local producer and former member of the band [Mr. Dog](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Dog)) in San Francisco, California in 1990. Counting Crows originally performed as an acoustic duo, playing gigs in and around the cities of Berkeley and San Francisco.      For the group’s first album, Adam and David added bassist Matt Malley, multi- instrument talent Charlie Gillingham, and drummer Steve Bowman. David Immergluck served as the second guitarist on the first album, but he did not officially join the band until 1999. Guitarist Dan Vickery was added just as the band set out on their first tour. As stated before, ‘_[August And Everything After](http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows/August+And+Everything+After)_’ provided the band with a surprise yet very welcome success, garnering them critical praise. Released on September 14, 1993 through Geffen Records, the album hit #2 on Billboard’s Heatseekers chart, showing that their tunes had tapped into something.      Counting Crows, with their intimate and confessional yet smooth, often catchy musical approach, achieved a large fan base among melodic rock fans over the years. Their [90s](http://www.last.fm/tag/90s) acclaim reflected that a significant music scene looked for something different from the raging guitars of the Seattle-based grunge movement as well as from either boilerplate pop music or the budding electronic music subgenres. The group kept on releasing new songs into the new millennium.      The band’s more recent successes include the 2004 hit song “[Accidentally in Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows/_/Accidentally+in+Love)”, which was featured on the Shrek 2 soundtrack (that has sold over 1,000,000 copies). That song has also garnered nominations for a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. That same year, the band released their first ever best of set, which they titled ‘_Films about Ghosts_’. That album features songs from every phase of the Counting Crows’ recording career. To date, the band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.      The group made the news when ‘_Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings_’ was released on March 25th, 2008
