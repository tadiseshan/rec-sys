The **Jungle Brothers** are an American hip hop group who pioneered the fusion of jazz and hip-hop. They began performing in the mid-1980s and released their first album, Straight Out the Jungle, in 1988. With Afrocentric lyrics and innovative beats, the Jungle Brothers were critically acclaimed and soon joined the influential [Native Tongues](http://www.last.fm/music/Native+Tongues) Posse. The trio is comprised of **Michael Small** (**Mike Gee**), **Nathaniel Hall** (**Afrika Baby Bam**) and **Sammy Burwell** (**DJ Sammy B**).      Their first album, “Straight Out the Jungle”, was released on an independent label and featured a hip hop/house collaboration “I’ll House You” produced by Todd Terry. In spite of the commercial failure of Straight Out the Jungle, Warner Brothers Records soon signed the group and released “Done By the Forces of Nature” in 1989. The album was a critical smash at the time, though it has since been largely ignored by hip hop critics, due to the similarly acclaimed fusion of jazz and rap “3 Feet High and Rising” by [De La Soul](http://www.last.fm/music/De+La+Soul) being released the same year. Following a four year break, the Jungle Brothers returned in 1993 with “J Beez Wit the Remedy”, another commercial disappointment. Their next album, “V.I.P.” was produced by Alex Gifford of Propellerheads and, during production, they found time to add their vocal stylings to the Propellerheads tracks “Take California (And Party)” and “You Want It Back”. In 2002 they released “All That We Do”. In 2005, the Jungle Brothers released a “greatest hits” and “classic remixes & rarities” double-CD entitled “This Is…”, which included remixes by The Wiseguys, Urban Takeover, Natural Born Chillers and Stereo MCs.
