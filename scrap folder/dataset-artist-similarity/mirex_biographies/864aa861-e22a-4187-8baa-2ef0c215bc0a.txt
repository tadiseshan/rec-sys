**Godflesh** are an [industrial metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial%20metal) band from Birmingham, England, formed in 1988 by Justin Karl Broadrick (guitar, vocals, and programming) and G. C. Green (bass). They are highly regarded as one of the founders of [industrial metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial%20metal). The group disbanded in 2002 but reformed in 2010, appearing in few festivals and starting to produce a new studio album.      In 1988, Broadrick contacted Green about reforming [Fall Of Because](http://www.last.fm/music/Fall+Of+Because), who fell apart in 1987. Justin decided to take over on guitars, and they chose to use a drum machine to replace Justin as a drummer. The newly formed band decided to change their name to Godflesh.      Godflesh established a presence in underground music with albums such as [Streetcleaner](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Streetcleaner) and [Pure](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Pure), which demonstrated the effectiveness of lo-fi production values in heavy music. A brief flirtation with major label Columbia Records in 1994 for [Selfless](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Selfless) and the [Merciless](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Merciless) EP saw the duo take on a more high-end production approach. In 1996 Godflesh released [Songs of Love and Hate](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Songs+of+Love+and+Hate), which featured the drumming of Bryan Mantia ([Guns N’ Roses](http://www.last.fm/music/Guns+N%27+Roses), [Primus](http://www.last.fm/music/Primus), [Praxis](http://www.last.fm/music/Praxis)). The next album, 1999’s [Us And Them](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Us+And+Them), saw the group experimenting with a more electronic, drum and bass-oriented sound in which the guitar played a less central role. In 2001 Godflesh released the double album retrospective [In All Languages](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/In+All+Languages). That same year they released an album of new material, [Hymns](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Hymns), which featured the precise drumming of new band member Ted Parsons (formerly of [Swans](http://www.last.fm/music/Swans) and [Prong](http://www.last.fm/music/Prong)) and brought the band back to its slow and heavy roots while retaining elements of its experiments with electronica.      Green left the band in late 2001. It was announced that he would be replaced by former Killing Joke and Prong bassist Paul Raven; however, Godflesh disbanded in 2002 when Broadrick suffered a nervous breakdown just before departing for a tour of the U.S. As a kind of parting gift, the group released a remastered version of their extremely rare 1994 EP [Messiah](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Messiah), which was doubled in length with all new remixes. Broadrick and Parsons went on to form [Jesu](http://www.last.fm/music/Jesu) in 2003.      Godflesh will reappear for a few shows in 2010, including one at [Hellfest](http://www.last
