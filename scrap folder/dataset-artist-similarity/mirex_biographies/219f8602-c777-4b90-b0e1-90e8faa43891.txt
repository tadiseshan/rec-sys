**DJ Spinna** (b. **[Vince Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Vince+Williams)**), is something of an anomaly in music. A humbling example of what it takes to truly succeed within the framework of multiple fields. A steadfast work ethic, an obsessively extensive vinyl library & the willingness to pursue - the full extent of his roots (funk, soul & jazz), foundation ([hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop)) & future (electronic / dance music) - without restraint.      A cornerstone of Hip-Hop’s late 90’s indie-uprise, DJ Spinna made much of his first impression on listeners as the musical background of his group [The Jigmastas](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Jigmastas) (having released an impressive slew of 12” singles on his then self-run label Beyond Real during this time) as well as providing the canvas for an array of that era’s lyrical giants. As an emcee in New York City, if you didn’t have a Spinna production under your belt, well, you just hadn’t accomplished all there was to accomplish. Everyone from [Mos Def](http://www.last.fm/music/Mos+Def), [Talib Kweli](http://www.last.fm/music/Talib+Kweli) to [Pharaohe Monch](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Pharaohe+Monch) boasted Spinna beats to prove their worth to the scene. At the height of indie-kingpin [rawkus records](http://www.last.fm/label/rawkus+records) heyday, Spinna was in demand, also churning out timeless classics of the era from the likes of [J-Live](http://www.last.fm/music/J-Live), [Mr. Complex](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Complex) and [The Polyrhythm Addicts](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Polyrhythm+Addicts) (his all-too-brief collabo-group with Apani B., Shaabam Sadeeq and Complex).      As collaborative production work flooded his studio, from hip-hop legends like [Sadat X](http://www.last.fm/music/Sadat+X) & [Grand Puba](http://www.last.fm/music/Grand+Puba) ([Brand Nubian](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian)), [Masta Ace](http://www.last.fm/music/Masta+Ace) and [Guru](http://www.last.fm/music/Guru) ([Gangstarr](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Gangstarr)) to even [The Jungle Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Jungle+Brothers). Yet, while his stock as a the go-to producer rose so did his value as a key, if not crucial, remixer. At the time reworking hits for the major-label likes of [De La Soul](http://www.last.fm/music/De+La+Soul) (“Stakes is High”) [Das EFX](http://www.last.fm/music/Das+EFX) and [MC Eiht](http://www.last.fm/music/MC+Eiht).      Turning heads throughout the industry, Spinna’s sonics soon infiltrated numerous genres. Tapped by everyone from [George Michael](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Michael) to [Mary J. Blige](http://www.last.fm/music/Mary+J.+Blige) to [Motown Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Motown+Records) (for his brilliant [Michael Jackson](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson) homage to “We’re Almost There”)
