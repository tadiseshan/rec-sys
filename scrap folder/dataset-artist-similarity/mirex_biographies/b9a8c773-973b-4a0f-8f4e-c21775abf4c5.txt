Turntablist Rob Swift was born Robert Aguilar in Jackson Heights, a neighborhood of Queens NY. Growing up, he was heavily influenced by cutting- edge [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) artist [Herbie Hancock](http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock) as well as the more typical DJ heroes like [Grandmaster Flash](http://www.last.fm/music/Grandmaster+Flash), Grand Wizard Theodore, and [DJ Premier](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Premier). After graduating from Baruch College with a degree in psychology, Swift joined one of the top scratching groups of the ’90s, [The X-Men](http://www.last.fm/music/The+X-Men) (later known as [The X-Ecutioners](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+X-Ecutioners)). In 1992, he won the DMC East Coast Turn Table Championship and DJed with rapper [Akinyele](http://www.last.fm/music/Akinyele) on his cross-country tour. A mixtape favorite, after one album with the X-Ecutioners Swift released his own widely praised debut, [Soulful Fruit](http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Swift/Soulful+Fruit), in 1997 on Asphodel, followed by [The Ablist](http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Swift/The+Ablist) in 1999. Thereafter, he released a succession of mixes for Triple Threat (Airwave Invasion), Tableturns (Sound Event), and Six Degrees (Under the Influence). In 2004, Swift left the X-Ecutioners with a very public slanging match between each other after the release of the album [Revolutions](http://www.last.fm/mus ic/+noredirect/The+X-Ecutioners/Revolutions) and went on to record OuMuPo, Vol. 2, a remix of artists from the Ici d’Ailleurs label, and 2005’s [War Games](http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Swift/War+Games), a soundtrack to the world after September 11.      A new album, [The Architect](http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Swift/The+Architect), is due on [Mike Patton](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Patton)’s Ipecac label in January 2010. (Swift has previously collaborated with Patton on the [General Patton vs The X -ecutioners](http://www.last.fm/music/General+Patton+vs.+The+X-Ecutioners/Gene ral+Patton+vs+The+X-ecutioners) album, also on Ipecac.)
